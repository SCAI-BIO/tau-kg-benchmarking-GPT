PMC4431475_0,"Tau is a central player in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related
Tauopathies, where it is found as aggregates in degenerating neurons. Abnormal
post-translational modifications, such as truncation, are likely involved in the
pathological process. A major step forward in understanding the role of Tau
truncation would be to identify the precise cleavage sites of the several truncated
Tau fragments that are observed until now in AD brains, especially those truncated
at the N-terminus, which are less characterized than those truncated at the
C-terminus. Here, we optimized a proteomics approach and succeeded in identifying a
number of new N-terminally truncated Tau species from the human brain. We initiated
cell-based functional studies by analyzing the biochemical characteristics of two
N-terminally truncated Tau species starting at residues Met11 and Gln124
respectively. Our results show, interestingly, that the Gln124-Tau fragment displays
a stronger ability to bind and stabilize microtubules, suggesting that the Tau
N-terminal domain could play a direct role in the regulation of microtubule
stabilization. Future studies based on our new N-terminally truncated-Tau species
should improve our knowledge of the role of truncation in Tau biology as well as in
the AD pathological process. The authors thank the Lille NeuroBank (CHRU-Lille) for providing brain tissues and M.

Team for the deposition of our data to the ProteomeXchange Consortium. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) mainly found in neurons and expressed in
the adult human brain as 6 isoforms (ranging from 352 to 441 amino acid residues in
length), which are derived from a single gene, MAPT, by the alternative splicing
of exons 2, 3 and 10<1>. Tau is composed of an amino terminal acidic
domain followed by two proline-rich domains and a microtubule-binding domain<2>. The latter contains 3 or 4 microtubule-binding repeats, depending
on whether the sequence encoded by exon 10 is included or not<3>. Tau
is primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule stability and dynamics as well as
axonal transport<4><5>. Besides its role as a MAP, Tau exhibits other
cellular localizations and functions that have been less investigated<6><7><8>. Tau proteins aggregate into filaments in a large group of
neurodegenerative disorders referred to as Tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's
Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17
(FTDP-17)<9>. AD is the most common Tauopathy and form of
dementia. One of its neuropathological hallmarks is neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD),
characterized by aggregated Tau proteins. Studies have shown that the progression of NFD
in cortical brain areas is closely correlated to cognitive impairment in AD, supporting
a central role for Tau in AD pathology<10><11>. As of now, the
mechanisms leading to NFD and its progression are far from being elucidated. Nevertheless, the deregulation of Tau phosphorylation is a key event in the pathological
process. Numerous studies suggest that abnormal phosphorylation impedes Tau binding to
microtubules, leading on the one hand to the depolymerization and loss of the latter,
and on the other hand to the formation of toxic aggregated Tau species<12>. Truncation is another post-translational modification that could have an
etiological role in Tau pathology. Numerous cell-based assays show that the truncation
of either the C-terminal part of Tau or both the N- and C-terminal parts impacts its
biochemical and functional properties and triggers a gain of toxic function<13><14><15><16>. Moreover, animal models based on the expression of
particular truncated Tau species are able to reproduce Tau pathology<16><17><18>. The analysis of AD brains by western blotting (WB) and
epitope mapping suggests the occurrence of cleavage sites in both the N-terminal and
C-terminal parts of Tau proteins<19><20>. While several N- and
C-terminally truncated Tau species are observed in AD brains, only a limited number of
specific Tau cleavage sites, after residues Asp13, Asp25, Asn368, Glu391 and Asp421,
have been identified so far in situ. The species generated by these cleavages are
found in neurofibrillary tangles, and their occurrence is correlated with the severity
of the disease<16><21><22><23><24><25><26>. The precise
identification of new Tau cleavage sites is a mandatory step in the generation of
appropriate experimental tools with which to investigate their impact on Tau
function/dysfunction and obtain new insights into the role of Tau truncation in
pathological process but also in physiological framework. In this context, we undertook
a challenging proteomics approach to precisely identify new Tau cleavage sites,
especially those at the N-terminus, which are less well characterized than those at the
C-terminus. We have identified several new N-terminally truncated Tau species in the
human brain, with N-terminal residues located throughout the Tau sequence, leading us to
expect that these Tau species would be of crucial functional and/or pathological
relevance. We therefore initiated cell-based functional studies by analyzing the
biochemical characteristics of two N-terminally truncated Tau species. Our results
suggest, surprisingly, that the Tau N-terminus could play a direct role in the
regulation of microtubule dynamics. WB analyses of human cortical brain samples using antibodies directed against the
N- and C-terminal parts of Tau protein revealed several truncated Tau species
(<Fig. 1A>), in agreement with previous reports<19><20>. These Tau species are also showed by using pSer396
antibody (<Fig. 1B>). It is worth noting that, as expected,
differential phosphorylation of the various Tau species was observed between the
samples and between the different brain areas with respect to Braak stages (7). In order to pinpoint new N-terminal truncation sites of Tau, we optimized a
proteomic approach (<Fig. 1C>) in brain samples. The whole
range of Tau species was immunoprecipitated (IP) from protein extracts with the
Tau-5 antibody, which recognizes amino acid residues 218–225<27>. As shown by WB analysis (<Fig. S1>),
Tau-5 IP allows the purification of full-length Tau (FL-Tau) as well as N- and
C-terminally truncated Tau and aggregated species, which display lower and
higher molecular weights, respectively. In order to improve detection
sensitivity, Tau-5 IP products were then subjected to primary amine labeling
using a covalently-linked biotin prior to enzymatic digestion with either
trypsin or the endoproteinase Asp-N. Labeled peptides were then purified on
streptavidin columns and identified using liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach resulted in the identification of a
number of Tau peptides (Table S1; data compiled from all samples), including
some semi-tryptic/semi-Asp-N peptides. Indeed, 21 peptides displayed
non-tryptic/non-Asp-N residues at the N-terminus and constituted our set of
candidates for N-truncated Tau species (<Table 1>). Out of
them, only 2 (Lys310, Lys 395) can be explained by the activity of possible
chymotrypsin contaminant. It should be noted that not all the peptides were
N-terminally labeled, in part because of the post-translational modification of
amines. Among these N-terminal sites, Ala2 was observed to be
Nα-acetylated, as previously reported by Hasegawa et al., who found
this Tau species in both normal and AD brains<28>.These new N-terminal sites were scattered across the Tau sequence (<Fig. 1D>), and except for Ala2, have not been described before. The
N-terminal sites located C-terminally to the Tau-5 epitope were detected
probably because they are found in situ in protein complexes with other Tau
species, as suggested by WB analysis showing high-molecular-weight Tau species
(<Fig. S1>). It is worth noting that known Tau binding
partners such as Hsc70<29> were also found in our analysis,
indicating that the experimental conditions supported co-IP (<Fig. S2>)."
PMC4431475_1,"Regarding the functional relevance of the new identified sites, since they are
scattered widely across the Tau sequence, one could expect each cleavage site to
have a specific impact, whether exclusive or not, on Tau function and
biochemical properties  We therefore initiated functional studies by analyzing
the biochemical characteristics of Tau species starting at residues Met11 (<Fig. S3A>) and Gln124 (<Fig. S3B>). These
residues are located in the Tau projection domain and are present in all Tau
isoforms (<Fig. 1D>). We generated expression vectors
containing coding sequences (cDNAs) of FL- and truncated-Tau species (<Fig. 2A>). These constructs were transfected into the N1E-115
neuroblastoma cell line. Forty-eight hours after transfection, WB analysis using
an antibody directed against the C-terminal part of Tau showed immunoreactive
bands at the expected molecular weights as well as mobility shifts likely
related to particular phosphorylated Tau species (<Fig.
2B>), but we cannot exclude that the shifts are due to other
modifications. An evaluation of phosphorylation status using antibodies to
phospho-Tau showed differential phosphorylation patterns (<Fig. 2C
and 2D>). Compared to FL-Tau, Met11-Tau displayed an increase in
phosphorylation at the Thr231 epitope (detected by the AT180 antibody), although
no difference in phosphorylation was observed at Ser396. Interestingly,
Gln124-Tau displayed a decrease in phosphorylation at Thr231 and Ser262/356
(detected by the 12E8 antibody), compared to FL-Tau. Since it has been shown that phosphorylation at Ser262/Ser356 strongly decreases
the binding of Tau to microtubules<30><31>, we asked whether
the truncation of the N-terminal part of Tau could have any consequences for Tau
function in microtubule stabilization. To investigate the properties of
N-terminally truncated Tau species with regard to microtubules, we first
compared the effect of their expression on microtubule modifications, in
particular the acetylation of α-tubulin, which is a hallmark of
stable microtubules<32>. WB analysis of transiently
transfected N1E-115 cells showed that, as expected, cells expressing FL-Tau
displayed an increase in the level of α-tubulin acetylation (<Fig. 3>). Regarding the effect of N-terminally truncated Tau,
the Met11-Tau fragment showed the same properties as FL-Tau while Gln124-Tau was
associated with a markedly increased level of acetylated tubulin compared to
FL-Tau. Given that Tau can interact with and inhibit the function of HDAC6, the
main tubulin deacetylase<33>, we investigated whether the
increase in tubulin acetylation in cells expressing Gln124-Tau was related to a
stronger inhibition of HDAC6 activity. We measured HDAC activity in cytoplasmic
extracts, since HDAC6 is mainly cytoplasmic compared to other HDAC members. Our
data (<Fig. S4>) show that there was no significant difference
in HDAC activity between cells transfected with FL-Tau and those with
N-terminally truncated species, indicating that the effect on tubulin
acetylation is not related to differences in HDAC6 activity. Instead, this
effect could be a consequence of improved microtubule polymerization and/or
stabilization. In agreement with this possibility, the investigation of another
post-translational modification of tubulin, detyrosination, which is also
representative of a stable population of microtubules<34>,
revealed that it was significantly increased with Gln124-Tau when compared to
FL-Tau (<Fig. 3>). Since tubulin acetylation and detyrosination occur once microtubules are
polymerized, the increase in their levels in cells expressing Gln124-Tau is
likely a consequence of improved microtubule polymerization and/or
stabilization. To investigate the capacity of Tau species to promote microtubule
polymerization in cells, we analyzed their ability to induce neurite-like
extensions in response to cytochalasin B. The process formation in this
experimental test is an indicator of the ability of Tau to assemble and
polymerize microtubules. Forty-eight hours after transfection, N1E-115 cells
were subjected to cytochalasin B treatment for 1 h. In agreement with
well-established reports<35>, immunolabeling analysis by
confocal microscopy showed that the breakdown of the cortical actin network by
cytochalasin B allowed cells expressing FL-Tau to lengthen microtubule bundles
into cellular extensions that looked like neurites (<Fig. S5A>). An analysis of cells expressing N-terminally truncated species
showed no evident difference in the number of cells displaying cellular
extensions compared to cells expressing FL-Tau (<Fig. S5B>). It is worth noting that, in accordance with the reported in vitro
studies, the ability of Tau to assemble and polymerize microtubules requires the
domains involved in microtubule binding and assembly: the second proline-rich
domain, the microtubule-binding repeats as well as inter-repeat regions<36><37>. Indeed, in our experiments, cells overexpressing a
Tau fragment that is truncated in the second proline-rich domain and a Tau
fragment that is truncated in the first repeat domain do not display any process
formation (<Fig. S6>).Next, we examined whether there was any difference in microtubule stabilization. We first compared the microtubule-association properties of FL-, Met11- and
Gln124-Tau species. Transiently transfected cells were fractionated into a
cytosol fraction (containing free Tau) and a microtubule fraction (containing
microtubule-associated Tau), and were analyzed by WB (<Fig.
4A>). As expected, both acetylated and detyrosinated tubulin forms
were mainly present in the microtubule-enriched fraction. Immunolabeling with a
Tau antibody revealed that all Tau species were found in both microtubule and
cytosol fractions. Nevertheless, the proportion of Gln124-Tau was higher in the
microtubule-enriched fraction (<Fig. 4B>), suggesting that
this fragment binds more strongly to microtubules compared to FL-Tau or
Met11-Tau.We then tested the ability of Gln124-Tau to protect microtubules from
depolymerization induced by nocodazole treatment. The nocodazole-resistance
experiment allows the capacity of Tau to protect microtubules from
depolymerization once they are assembled to be evaluated, and is hence an
indicator of microtubule stability and dynamics. Transfected N1E-115 cells were
treated for 20 minutes with nocodazole and subjected to cytosol/microtubule
fractionation for WB analysis of microtubule depolymerization and Tau release
from microtubules. Nocodazole treatment induced microtubule depolymerization and
Tau release from microtubules, as shown by decreased tubulin and Tau
immunolabeling, respectively, in the microtubule fraction from treated cells
(<Fig. 5A>). However, cells expressing Gln124-Tau were
markedly more resistant to nocodazole treatment compared to cells expressing
FL-Tau. Indeed, higher levels of tubulin were observed in the microtubule
fraction from nocodazole-treated Gln124-Tau cells compared to cells transfected
with the other Tau species (<Fig. 5A and 5B>). To confirm
these data, transfected N1E-115 cells were treated for 20 minutes with
nocodazole and the disruption of Tau-induced microtubule bundles analyzed by
confocal microscopy (<Fig. 5C>). The results show that
unlike cells expressing FL-Tau or Met11-Tau, microtubule bundles were still
present in almost all cells expressing Gln124-Tau after 20 min of
treatment (<Fig. 5C and 5D>). Hence, microtubules in cells
expressing Gln124-Tau are less sensitive to depolymerization than microtubules
in cells expressing FL-Tau or Met11-Tau. In this work, using a dedicated proteomics approach, we identified new N-terminally
truncated Tau species in the human brain by identifying their precise primary amine
residues. Our finding lays the groundwork for the development of appropriate tools
with which to monitor species truncated at these newly identified sites under
physiological and pathological conditions, and obtain new insights into the role of
truncation in Tau function and dysfunction."
PMC4431475_2,"Truncation is one of the post-translational modifications of Tau encountered in AD
brains, as shown by the detection of several Tau species truncated at the N- and
C-terminus<19><20>  The determination of the precise cleavage
sites of some of these Tau species was initially made possible by epitope
mapping<21><22><23><24><25>. While the main C-terminal
cleavage sites (Glu391 and Asp421) are well characterized, among the plethora of
N-terminally truncated species, only two have been identified in situ<24><25>. The purpose of our proteomics approach was to simplify
peptide mixtures before MS/MS identification, in order to enhance the probability of
identifying the N-terminal extremities of these Tau species. Our approach required
the labeling of available amino groups on intact proteins using an
N-hydroxysuccinide (NHS) ester derivative of biotin. Biotinylated peptides were then
purified using streptavidin and analyzed by MS/MS. Indeed, as we started with human
brain tissue, we needed to avoid multiple peptide-purification steps in order to
strike a balance between peptide loss and N-terminal enrichment, although effective
protocols have been published<38>. In order for a peptide to be
validated as a candidate for N-terminal Tau truncation, its amino-terminal extremity
should not be a cleavage site for the protease used (trypsin or Asp-N) and it should
be found in several samples in order to reduce the probability of random cleavage by
the enzyme, even if trypsin has been reported to be very specific<39>. It should be noted that labeling of the amino-terminal group was not
considered an absolute validation criterion due to the fact that our labeling
procedure was probably not complete under the experimental conditions used. For some
peptides, the amino-terminal group was blocked by post-translational modifications,
such as the Nα-acetylation of Ala2. Here, we identified a number of new
Tau N-terminal sites, but there is a gap between the detection and the
quantification of these Tau species in normal and AD brains. Right now, we cannot
say with any certainty which cleavage sites are relevant to the disease process and
which are specific to the physiological context. Likewise, the impact of post-mortem
delay cannot be unequivocally addressed. The present approach allows for the
identification but not the quantification of the amino-truncated species. In fact,
to obtain reliable quantitative results, it is necessary to avoid the IP and
N-terminal labeling of Tau proteins we used in our study. To reach this goal, the
method of choice would be the development of specific antibodies, as was initially
done for C-terminally truncated Tau species, especially those ending at Glu391 and
Asp421<21><22><23>. Hence, our interesting findings provide
the basis for the development of appropriate tools with which to monitor truncated
species that start at these newly identified sites, as well as the corresponding
C-terminally truncated species, under physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, these tools would be of interest in the diagnostic field.Regarding the consequences of truncation to Tau protein properties, our initial
cell-based studies show that the ability of Tau to stabilize microtubules is greater
when the N-terminal part is truncated. Indeed, the Gln124-Tau fragment showed a
stronger ability to bind microtubules and protect them from depolymerization
compared to FL-Tau. In agreement with this supposition, cells expressing the
Gln124-Tau fragment display a significant increase in post-translational
modifications characteristic of stable microtubules (α-tubulin
acetylation and detyrosination). It is widely accepted, based mainly on in
vitro analyses of Tau fragments generated by amino-terminal deletions, that
Tau binds microtubules and regulates their stabilization and polymerization through
its C-terminal part. These earlier studies indicated that the direct effects of Tau
with regard to microtubules involves a region encompassing amino acid residues
215–358, which contains the second proline-rich domain, the
microtubule-binding repeats as well as inter-repeat regions<36><37>. The role of the Tau amino-terminal domain with regard to microtubules has
been reported as being indirect, such as by the regulation of microtubule
spacing<40> and functions<41><42>. Nevertheless, in lines with our data, in vitro studies of the impact of
missense mutations encountered in Tauopathies (mutations at the Arg5 and at Gly55
residues) suggest that the modification of the amino-terminal domain of Tau could
directly impact microtubules<43><44><45>. Besides, a recent in
vitro attempt to improve mechanisms of Tau interaction with microtubules
based on the use of Tau fragments generated by limited proteolysis has shown that
the Tau fragment Ser208-Ser324 binds more tightly to microtubules than FL-Tau and
favors their assembly<46>. In agreement with these in
vitro assays, our cell-based study of the N-terminally truncated Tau
fragment (Gln124-Tau) newly identified in situ suggests that the
amino-terminal domain of Tau could directly regulate its binding and stabilization
of microtubules. To further characterize the Gln124-Tau fragment, it would be of
interest to evaluate, on the one hand, whether the observed effects are
isoform-dependent, and on the other hand, the impact of Gln124-Tau on the functions
of FL-Tau. Indeed, the current work was performed in a cell line that does not
display detectable levels of endogenous FL-Tau.Regarding the mechanisms underlying the gain of function displayed by the Gln124-Tau
fragment, one explanation could be related to the fact that the Tau protein is prone
to adopt a “paperclip” conformation as a result of
intra-molecular interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains<47><48>. Hence, N-terminal truncation would be expected to unfold
Tau from this conformation and to expose the microtubule-binding domain. This
explanation is unlikely under our experimental conditions, since we find no obvious
difference with regard to microtubule stabilization between the Met11-Tau fragment
and FL-Tau. A more plausible explanation would be that Gln124-Tau, due to the
truncation of the negatively charged N-terminus, displays enhanced binding to the
negative surface of microtubules.Concerning the biological significance of this gain of function, sustained
microtubule stabilization is likely to have a deleterious effect on neurons by
impairing synaptic plasticity and microtubule-dependent transport. Indeed, mutations
in FTDP-17 that lead to an increase in 4R Tau isoforms, which stabilize microtubules
more strongly than 3R isoforms, are the cause of neuronal death and dementia<49>. Moreover, given that the microtubule-severing proteins
katanin and spastin have a more potent effect on stable microtubules<50><51>, a sustained increase in microtubule stability and its
associated α-tubulin acetylation and detyrosination might lead to the
increased recruitment of severing enzymes and microtubule loss due to excess
cutting<52><53>.In summary, this work identifies new N-terminally truncated Tau species that occur in
the human brain and that have potential relevance to Tau biology and likely to
AD-related Tauopathies. Our preliminary cell-based studies suggest, interestingly,
that the N-terminal part of Tau could be directly involved in the regulation of
microtubule stabilization. N-terminal truncation may also influence other Tau
properties such as polymerization<22> and cellular
localization<54>. Future investigations based on our newly
identified N-terminally truncated Tau species, in particular Gln124-Tau, should
improve our knowledge as to the role of truncation in Tau biology as well as in the
AD pathological process. Human brain autopsy samples were from the Lille NeuroBank collection (Centre de

Tauopathies, where it is found as aggregates in degenerating neurons. Abnormal
post-translational modifications, such as truncation, are likely involved in the
pathological process. A major step forward in understanding the role of Tau
truncation would be to identify the precise cleavage sites of the several truncated
Tau fragments that are observed until now in AD brains, especially those truncated
at the N-terminus, which are less characterized than those truncated at the
C-terminus."
PMC4431475_5,"Here, we optimized a proteomics approach and succeeded in identifying a
number of new N-terminally truncated Tau species from the human brain  We initiated
cell-based functional studies by analyzing the biochemical characteristics of two
N-terminally truncated Tau species starting at residues Met11 and Gln124
respectively. Our results show, interestingly, that the Gln124-Tau fragment displays
a stronger ability to bind and stabilize microtubules, suggesting that the Tau
N-terminal domain could play a direct role in the regulation of microtubule
stabilization. Future studies based on our new N-terminally truncated-Tau species
should improve our knowledge of the role of truncation in Tau biology as well as in
the AD pathological process. ."
PMC6122971_0,"Martini-Stoica et al. demonstrate that the TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway in astrocytes is increased in tauopathy and plays a functional role in modulating extracellular tau and the propagation of neuronal tau pathology in a mouse model of tau spreading. The progression of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease follows a stereotyped pattern, and recent evidence suggests a role of synaptic connections in this process. Astrocytes are well positioned at the neuronal synapse to capture and degrade extracellular tau as it transits the synapse and hence could potentially have the ability to inhibit tau spreading and delay disease progression. Our study shows increased expression and activity of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in response to tau pathology in both human brains with dementia and transgenic mouse models. Exogenous TFEB expression in primary astrocytes enhances tau fibril uptake and lysosomal activity, while TFEB knockout has the reverse effect. In vivo, induced TFEB expression in astrocytes reduces pathology in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice, as well as prominently attenuates tau spreading from the ipsilateral to the contralateral hippocampus in a mouse model of tau spreading. Our study suggests that astrocytic TFEB plays a functional role in modulating extracellular tau and the propagation of neuronal tau pathology in tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease.

Tauopathies include a broad range of neurological diseases that are characterized by intracellular inclusions of aberrant tau protein. In Alzheimer’s disease, the most common tauopathy, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau accumulate and are strongly correlated with progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration (<Giannakopoulos et al., 2003>). Evidence from postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brains suggests that NFT pathology progresses in a hierarchical, stereotyped pattern beginning in the transentorhinal cortex and eventually spreading to synaptically connected brain regions such as the hippocampus and, later, the cortex (<Braak and Braak, 1995>). This pathological spreading pattern is the basis of Braak staging in Alzheimer’s disease and is associated with changes in memory and other cognitive domains (<Grober et al., 1999>). However, the precise mechanism of the tau spreading pattern is unknown. Mounting evidence suggests tau aggregates can cross cell membranes and seed tau pathology followed by subsequent spreading of pathology to other cells, resulting in the cell-to-cell transfer or prion-like propagation of tau pathology (<Frost et al., 2009>; <Guo and Lee, 2011>). This theory of tau spreading suggests a crucial role of extracellular tau species in disease progression. Lending further support to this mechanism are studies where the intracranial injection of synthetic tau fibrils or tauopathy mouse brain extract in transgenic tau mice resulted in the induction of NFT-like pathology and spreading of pathology to synaptically connected brain regions (<Clavaguera et al., 2009>; <Iba et al., 2013>). Moreover, studies have shown increased CSF tau levels in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as detected tau in the brain interstitial fluid via in vivo microdialysis in a tauopathy mouse model (<Riemenschneider et al., 2003>; <Yamada et al., 2011>). Given the proposed role of extracellular tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, targeting this species of tau could be relevant to halting disease progression.Evidence suggests that tau spreading between neurons occurs trans-synaptically (<Wu et al., 2016>). While neurons would seem to be the main players in this process, astroglia may be uniquely poised to modulate this process given their close physical proximity to neurons and formation of “tripartite” synapses consisting of astroglial projections and neuronal pre- and post-synaptic terminals (<Halassa et al., 2007>; <Perea et al., 2009>). Astrocytes are also the most abundant cell type in the brain and play many complex roles in the central nervous system (CNS; such as modulating synapse formation, maintaining neuronal homeostasis through metabolic support, and comprising part of the blood–brain barrier (<Barres, 2008>). Astroglia also react to neuronal injury and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease with changes in morphology, gene expression, and function (<Pekny et al., 2016>). In Alzheimer’s disease, reactive astrocytes have a prominent role in neuroinflammation through the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytotoxic molecules, which is thought to exacerbate pathology (<Heneka et al., 2015>). However, astrocytes also express genes involved in phagocytosis, which may attenuate pathology through uptake and clearance of protein aggregates (<Cahoy et al., 2008>). This phagocytic capacity has been demonstrated with respect to Aβ in several studies (<Wyss-Coray et al., 2003>; <Basak et al., 2012>; <Li et al., 2014>; <Xiao et al., 2014>), but little is known about the ability of astrocytes to modulate tau pathology.In a transgenic model of tau spreading, astrocytes take up hyperphosphorylated tau as synapses degenerate (<de Calignon et al., 2012>). Tau inclusions are also present in astroglia in several tauopathies, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and Pick’s disease (<Chin and Goldman, 1996>). In addition, glial fibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau accumulate in the medial temporal lobe of older individuals in what are called thorn-shaped astrocytes (<Schultz et al., 2004>). More recently, neuropathologists have sought to more systematically characterize the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau in astrocytes, broadly referring to this phenomenon as aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG; <Kovacs et al., 2016>, <2017a>,<b>)."
PMC6122971_1,"ARTAG may be a benign part of normal aging, but may also be a sinister harbinger of the development of a primary tauopathy, either resulting in pathological tau inclusions in astrocytes or indicating astrocyte involvement in early stages of trans-synaptic tau spreading (<Kovacs et al , 2017b>). Recent findings also suggest the possibility of neuron to astrocyte or even glia to glia tau spreading mechanisms in certain tauopathies such as PSP and CBD (<Narasimhan et al., 2017>). How and why these glial aggregates accumulate (tau uptake versus aberrant/ectopic tau expression) is still a mystery, but a possible explanation lies in the impairment of one of the main mechanisms of bulk protein degradation, the autophagy lysosomal pathway. Defects in the lysosomal pathway can occur with aging (<Kato et al., 1998>; <Cuervo and Dice, 2000>; <Wolfe et al., 2013>) or due to familial Alzheimer’s disease–related loss of presenilin (<Lee et al., 2010>, <2015>; <Coen et al., 2012>). Furthermore, lysosomal dysfunction alone results in the accumulation of aberrant tau (<Oyama et al., 1998>; <Nixon, 2004>). One possible approach to combat the accumulation of tau is to enhance the degradative capacity of the lysosomal pathway. Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that stimulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy when activated, resulting in the breakdown of proteins and lipids for nutrients (<Sardiello et al., 2009>; <Settembre et al., 2011>). TFEB also promotes clearance of aberrant storage material in lysosomal storage disorders (<Medina et al., 2011>; <Song et al., 2013>; <Spampanato et al., 2013>; <Palmieri et al., 2017>). CNS expression of TFEB results in clearance of aberrant tau species in tau transgenic mice, though this was primarily attributed to an intraneuronal/cell autonomous mechanism (<Polito et al., 2014>). Here, we demonstrate a functional role for astroglial TFEB in stimulating the uptake and clearance of aberrant extracellular tau thereby preventing neuronal spreading of tau pathology in a mouse model of tauopathy. TFEB activation has been linked to lysosomal stress and the accumulation of aberrant protein aggregates, indicated by TFEB’s nuclear localization in lysosomal storage disorders (<Sardiello et al., 2009>; <Song et al., 2013>). To determine if a similar phenomenon occurs in the protein aggregopathies of Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, the status of TFEB activation in relation to clinical disease progression was analyzed (Mount Sinai School of Medicine [MSSM], Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s disease [AMP-AD] RNA-seq project, Synapse ID: syn8484987). Transcriptional levels of TFEB and several of its well-known lysosomal targets were stratified by no dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia, showing that these transcript levels positively correlate with cognitive decline (<Fig. 1 A> and Fig. S1, A–C). Further, transcriptional levels of these same genes were also positively correlated with increasing Braak score, indicating a relationship between the TFEB lysosomal pathway and worsening pathology (<Fig. 1 B> and Fig. S1, D–F). In addition, human brains diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) demonstrated an increase in transcriptional levels of TFEB and TFEB lysosomal target gene LAMP1 (<Fig. 1 C>). On the protein level, TFEB lysosomal target genes LAMP1 and Cathepsin D (CTSD) are also increased in the FTD frontal cortex relative to normal subjects, and TFEB protein levels trended increased with statistical significance in the CBD group (<Fig. 1, D and E>). In the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy (<Ramsden et al., 2005>; <SantaCruz et al., 2005>), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of microarray data revealed a similar enrichment of TFEB’s transcriptional profile when comparing 4-mo-old transgenic mice with widespread NFTs to wild-type mice, indicating TFEB’s activation with tau pathology (<Fig. 1 F>). Examining the protein levels in another tauopathy mouse model, hippocampal lysates from PS19 mice (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>) at 10 mo of age showed increases in TFEB and lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and CTSD compared with wild-type mice (Fig. S1, G and H). With TFEB protein expression detected in total brain lysate, we also confirmed its expression at the protein level in specific CNS cell types including astrocytes, neurons, and microglia isolated for primary culture (Fig. S1 I). Since multiple cell types in the CNS express TFEB, we isolated astrocytes from the forebrain of the rTg4510 mice via FACS and performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to understand the astroglial contribution to TFEB activation in tauopathy (<Swartzlander et al., 2018>). Transcriptomic analysis of these isolated astrocytes revealed an increase in TFEB transcripts, as well as transcripts of several of its well-known target genes in the rTg4510 relative to wild-type controls (<Fig. 1 G>). This cell type specific data suggests that TFEB is activated in astrocytes in response to tauopathy. In addition, TFEB’s subcellular localization in astrocytes was analyzed via FLAG immunostaining of AAV-GFAP-TFEB3×FLAG–injected mice. Two groups of mice, wild-type and rTg4510 mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at post-natal day 3 (P3) with an Adeno-associated virus (AAV)–expressing a human TFEB-FLAG fusion protein under a GFAP promoter for astrocyte specific expression. Quantitation of TFEB-3×FLAG nuclear localization, a marker of TFEB activation, in these mice revealed a significant increase in TFEB nuclear localization with tau pathology (<Fig. 1, H and I>). A similar increase in astrocyte TFEB nuclear localization was also observed in tau spreading mice (Fig. S1, J and K). Overall, these findings indicate an activation of TFEB relative to both cognitive decline in humans and tau pathology in mouse models. In particular, this activation is present in astrocytes, suggesting that astroglial TFEB may be part of a compensatory/adaptive response to cellular stress induced by aberrant protein aggregation. rhetorical Figure 1.

In the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy (<Ramsden et al., 2005>; <SantaCruz et al., 2005>), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of microarray data revealed a similar enrichment of TFEB’s transcriptional profile when comparing 4-mo-old transgenic mice with widespread NFTs to wild-type mice, indicating TFEB’s activation with tau pathology (<Fig. 1 F>). Examining the protein levels in another tauopathy mouse model, hippocampal lysates from PS19 mice (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>) at 10 mo of age showed increases in TFEB and lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and CTSD compared with wild-type mice (Fig. S1, G and H). With TFEB protein expression detected in total brain lysate, we also confirmed its expression at the protein level in specific CNS cell types including astrocytes, neurons, and microglia isolated for primary culture (Fig. S1 I). Since multiple cell types in the CNS express TFEB, we isolated astrocytes from the forebrain of the rTg4510 mice via FACS and performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to understand the astroglial contribution to TFEB activation in tauopathy (<Swartzlander et al., 2018>).

Quantitation of TFEB-3×FLAG nuclear localization, a marker of TFEB activation, in these mice revealed a significant increase in TFEB nuclear localization with tau pathology (<Fig. 1, H and I>). A similar increase in astrocyte TFEB nuclear localization was also observed in tau spreading mice (Fig. S1, J and K). Overall, these findings indicate an activation of TFEB relative to both cognitive decline in humans and tau pathology in mouse models. In particular, this activation is present in astrocytes, suggesting that astroglial TFEB may be part of a compensatory/adaptive response to cellular stress induced by aberrant protein aggregation. To examine TFEB’s regulation of known lysosomal targets in astrocytes, we cultured primary astrocytes from wild-type mice (C57/BL6) and used an AAV delivery approach to overexpress TFEB or EGFP as described above (<Fig. 2 A>). As expected, the expression of several TFEB lysosomal target genes was significantly up-regulated in TFEB-transduced astrocytes, including lysosomal marker LAMP1 and lysosomal proteases, cathepsins A and B (<Fig. 2 B>). Likewise, protein expression of lysosomal TFEB targets LAMP1, CTSB, and the mature form of CTSD were increased (<Fig. 2, C and D>). To determine if TFEB overexpression increases overall lysosomal biogenesis, we stained AAV-transduced primary astrocytes with LysoTracker red dye and demonstrated an increase in the abundance of acidic organelles such as lysosomes and late endosomes in TFEB-transduced astrocytes (<Fig. 2 E>). In sum, these results demonstrate that TFEB regulates the lysosomal pathway in primary astrocytes. rhetorical Figure 2.

In sum, these results demonstrate that TFEB regulates the lysosomal pathway in primary astrocytes.To test TFEB’s role in phagocytosis in primary astrocytes, we used flow cytometry to analyze the uptake of red fluorescent latex beads in conditions of AAV-mediated TFEB overexpression versus EGFP transduced controls. TFEB not only increased the proportion of cells taking up beads, but also increased the proportion of cells taking up multiple beads, suggesting an enhanced phagocytic capacity (<Fig. 2, F–H>). Given that TFEB stimulates uptake of a nonspecific substance such as latex beads in astrocytes, we proceeded to test if this increased phagocytic capacity could also apply to the uptake of pffs. Synthetic tau fibrils of the truncated form of human tau with the P301L mutation (K18 P301L) were generated as previously described (<Li and Lee, 2006>; <Guo and Lee, 2011>) and dye-conjugated to AlexaFluor-647 for ease of detection. The dye-conjugated pffs were then incubated with primary astrocytes transduced with TFEB or EGFP, followed by trypsinization to remove cell surface–bound pffs. The suspended live cells were then subject to flow cytometry analysis to detect the cellular fluorescent signal from internalized dye-conjugated pffs. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of 12% in the uptake of pffs in TFEB transduced astrocytes relative to control at the 1-h time point, with a 22% relative increase in uptake in the TFEB transduced cells at 4 h (<Fig. 2 I>). This suggests that not only does TFEB increase pff uptake, it also increases the rate of uptake. While TFEB overexpression in astrocytes resulted in a significant increase in pff uptake, the magnitude of the change was rather modest. One possible explanation for these small but significant changes is inefficient activation (i.e., reduced nuclear localization) of TFEB in our AAV-transduced primary astrocyte culture. Using FLAG immunostaining for the transduced FLAG-tagged TFEB construct, confocal microscopy revealed that under basal primary astrocyte culture conditions, TFEB was predominantly cytoplasmic in its inactive state (<Fig. 2 J>). To drive TFEB nuclear localization and recapitulate the activation status observed in tauopathy, primary astrocytes were treated with the mTORC1 inhibitor Torin1. mTORC1 phosphorylates TFEB, which sequesters the transcription factor in the cytoplasm (<Peña-Llopis et al., 2011>; <Martina et al., 2012>; <Roczniak-Ferguson et al., 2012>; <Settembre et al., 2012>). Inhibiting mTORC1 blocks the phosphorylation of TFEB, allowing unphosphorylated TFEB to translocate to the nucleus and become transcriptionally active (<Settembre et al., 2012>). Confocal microscopy of FLAG immunostaining for FLAG-tagged TFEB demonstrates the nuclear localization of TFEB following Torin1 treatment as shown by colabeling with DAPI (<Fig. 2 J>). Additional LAMP1 staining also reveals TFEB’s colocalization with the lysosome with Torin1 treatment, an indication of TFEB temporarily trapped on the lysosomal surface due to its interaction with the recently inactivated mTORC1 (<Fig. 2 J>; <Settembre et al., 2012>). Given that Torin1 treatment leads to increased nuclear localization of TFEB relative to basal conditions, we tested whether Torin1 would further increase the uptake of pffs in TFEB transduced primary astrocytes. Primary astrocytes were subjected to 3 h of Torin1 treatment or basal conditions before 1-h incubation with dye-conjugated pffs. Flow cytometry revealed that Torin1 treatment of TFEB transduced astrocytes increased dye-conjugated pff uptake 63% relative to EGFP transduced controls as shown by median fluorescence intensity, while under basal conditions, the TFEB overexpressing astrocytes increased uptake just 18% relative to EGFP expressing controls (<Fig. 2 K>). Thus, TFEB enhances phagocytic pathways in astrocytes, in particular increasing the uptake of pffs.To contrast and complement the TFEB overexpression studies, we cultured primary astrocytes from nestin-cre tcfeb knockout (TFEB KO) pups. qRT-PCR demonstrated undetectable transcript levels of TFEB as well as a reduction in LAMP1 mRNA in TFEB KO astrocytes compared with littermate controls (<Fig. 2 L>). In addition, the TFEB KO astrocyte culture demonstrated a modest reduction in LysoTracker Red staining, indicating a reduction in lysosomes and/or lysosomal acidity (<Fig. 2 M>). Recapitulating the uptake assay with dye-conjugated pffs in TFEB KO astrocytes, we observed a modest reduction pff uptake compared with primary astrocytes from littermate controls (<Fig. 2 N>). These findings indicate that endogenous TFEB regulates cellular uptake and provide additional support for a functional role of TFEB in astroglial uptake of tau. We next sought to determine the mechanism by which TFEB enhances astroglial uptake of pffs and the subcellular localization of phagocytosed pffs. To study pff handling in astrocytes, primary astrocyte cultures were incubated with dye-conjugated pffs and underwent immunostaining with LAMP1 antibody. Confocal microscopy revealed an expected increase in lysosomal marker LAMP1 staining, as well as an increase in dye-conjugated fibril fluorescence signal in TFEB transduced astrocytes (<Fig. 3 A>). Enhanced colocalization of dye-conjugated pffs and LAMP1 is observed in the TFEB transduced astrocytes, which is quantified based on number of colocalized pixels (<Fig. 3, A and C>). These findings indicate TFEB increases the incidence of phagocytosed pffs inside the lysosome. In addition, we also sought to demonstrate that TFEB enhances both uptake and degradation of phagocytosed proteins. Dye-quenched BSA (DQ-BSA) or boron-dipyrromethene dye–conjugated BSA is taken up by macropinocytosis and fluoresces following proteolysis in lysosomes. Flow cytometry analysis of primary astrocytes incubated with DQ-BSA revealed an ∼60% increase in median fluorescence for TFEB-transduced astrocytes, indicating that TFEB enhances uptake and proteolysis of DQ-BSA (<Fig. 3 D>). In contrast, TFEB KO astrocytes had an ∼25% decrease in median fluorescence following a 3-h incubation with DQ-BSA (<Fig. 3 E>). In sum, these data suggest that TFEB stimulates uptake and trafficking of pffs to the lysosome for degradation. rhetorical Figure 3.

In sum, these data suggest that TFEB stimulates uptake and trafficking of pffs to the lysosome for degradation.Previous studies indicate pff uptake in the cell-to-cell transfer process occurs via macropinocytosis through interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface (<Holmes et al., 2013>). Heparin, a pharmacologic agent used as an anticoagulant, is in the same family as HSPGs and is structurally similar to this cell surface moiety. Thus, heparin can be used to competitively inhibit pff binding to HSPGs and prevent cellular uptake via macropinocytosis. Confocal microscopy revealed that heparin treatment reduces the fluorescence signal of pffs in primary astrocytes transduced with TFEB (<Fig. 3 A>). In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that heparin reduces dye-conjugated pff uptake in both TFEB and EGFP transduced astrocytes, suggesting that macropinocytosis is responsible for astroglial pff uptake (<Fig. 3 B>). Overall, this data indicates TFEB enhances astroglial uptake of pffs via macropinocytosis for subsequent delivery to the lysosome for degradation. Given that TFEB enhances lysosomal biogenesis and uptake of extracellular pffs in vitro, we next sought to determine whether astroglial TFEB impacts tau pathology and tau spreading in vivo. To test this potential role of astroglial TFEB, we used an AAV-mediated gene delivery strategy of AAV-GFAP-TFEB (or AAV-GFAP-EGFP as a control) described above. Previous studies have shown that the GFAP promoter primarily targets astrocytes (<von Jonquieres et al., 2013>; <Xiao et al., 2014>). The AAV was injected ICV into both lateral ventricles of mouse pups at P3. Pups were injected at P3 based on a prior study indicating the AAV serotype 2/8 preferentially infects astrocytes at this age (<Chakrabarty et al., 2013>). ICV AAV injections at this age also lead to widespread expression in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. S2, A and B). 4 mo after injection, the mice were assessed for expression patterns of the AAV delivered TFEB. Confocal microscopy of costaining for FLAG-tagged TFEB and astrocytic marker GFAP in the hippocampus showed AAV-mediated expression of TFEB occurred in astrocytes as signified by the colocalization of the two antibodies (<Fig. 4 A>). Quantification of GFAP/FLAG colocalization revealed that 44.4 ± 3.8% (average ± SEM, n = 4) of GFAP-positive astrocytes were also FLAG-positive in the hippocampus following P3 injections. To demonstrate that AAV-mediated TFEB expression was astrocyte specific, costaining of FLAG with Iba1 and NeuN, a microglial marker and neuronal marker, respectively, is also shown, with no colocalization between FLAG and neuronal or microglial markers present (<Fig. 4 A>). This evidence suggests that this AAV-mediated gene delivery predominantly affects astrocytes. Having shown the targeting specificity of this gene delivery strategy, we next sought to confirm the activity of exogenous astroglial TFEB in vivo. Hippocampal brain extract from TFEB-injected mice exhibited an ∼13-fold increase in TFEB transcripts as well as significant increases in the transcript levels of TFEB target genes compared with EGFP-injected littermates (<Fig. 4, B and C>). On the protein level, LAMP1 and both immature and mature forms of CTSD were significantly increased in the hippocampus of TFEB-injected mice (<Fig. 4, D and E>). In addition, protein homogenate from the hippocampus of TFEB-injected mice had increased CTSD enzyme activity relative to EGFP-injected littermates (<Fig. 4 F>). Thus, our AAV gene delivery strategy is astrocyte specific and up-regulates lysosomal target genes in vivo. rhetorical Figure 4.

Thus, our AAV gene delivery strategy is astrocyte specific and up-regulates lysosomal target genes in vivo.Having established that astrocytic TFEB has a role in tau handling through lysosomal and cellular uptake pathways, we sought to investigate whether astroglial TFEB overexpression affects additional pathways that may impact tau pathology/tau spreading. In particular, we studied the effect on general astrocyte properties and neuronal activity. To determine if AAV-mediated astroglial TFEB expression influenced astrocyte morphology or reactivity, P3-injected wild-type mice underwent immunostaining with reactive astrocyte marker GFAP. Representative fluorescent confocal images of GFAP staining in the hippocampus show no obvious morphological changes in astrocytes between groups (<Fig. 4 G>), which is validated by quantitation of area fluorescence of GFAP immunostaining (<Fig. 4 H>). In addition, we used electrophysiology to study neuronal activity in the context of astroglial TFEB overexpression. Previous work indicates that neuronal activity influences the rate of synaptic tau release, which may impact tau spreading (<Wu et al., 2016>), and astrocytes can impact neuronal signaling through lysosomal exocytosis of ATP (<Zhang et al., 2007>; <Lalo et al., 2016>). Since TFEB can enhance lysosomal exocytosis, we sought to determine if astroglial TFEB alters neuronal activity. From acute hippocampal slices of 9-mo-old P3-injected mice with AAV-GFAP-EGFP or AAV-GFAP-TFEB, spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded from granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. sEPSCs events are generated by both action potential dependent neurotransmitter release, as well as action potential independent neurotransmitter release, and therefore can represent ongoing neuronal activity in the hippocampal circuitry. Neither sEPSCs amplitude nor frequency show statistically significant differences between AAV-GFAP-EGFP and AAV-GFAP-TFEB mice (<Fig. 4, I and J>). Thus, AAV-mediated astroglial TFEB expression does not impact astrocyte reactivity/morphology or neuronal activity in wild-type mice, excluding these possible indirect effects on tau release. After validating our AAV-mediated gene delivery technique for astroglial TFEB expression in vivo, we next focused on the impact of astroglial TFEB on tau pathology in the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model. Using P3 ICV AAV injections of GFAP-TFEB or GFAP-EGFP in rTg4510 mice, tau pathology was analyzed biochemically and histologically at 4 mo of age. Immunoblotting for total tau and phospho-tau antibodies, PHF1 and CP13, demonstrated no statistical difference in hippocampal brain lysate from TFEB- versus EGFP-injected rTg4510 male or female mice (<Fig. 5, A–C>). Similarly, immunofluorescence staining for an early pathological conformation of tau using the MC1 antibody showed no significant difference in area fluorescence in the hippocampus or cortex of TFEB and EGFP groups, nor did staining with phospho-tau antibody AT8 (<Fig. 5, D–I>). Female mice also showed no difference in area fluorescence using the same antibodies for pathological tau (<Fig. 5, F and I>). In addition, immunofluorescence staining for astro- and microgliosis markers GFAP and Iba1, respectively, showed no change in area fluorescence in TFEB- or EGFP-injected male mice (Fig. S3). Thus, tau pathology and gliosis in the rTg4510 is not impacted by astroglial TFEB in the cortex or hippocampus at 4 mo of age. rhetorical Figure 5.

In addition, immunofluorescence staining for astro- and microgliosis markers GFAP and Iba1, respectively, showed no change in area fluorescence in TFEB- or EGFP-injected male mice (Fig. S3). Thus, tau pathology and gliosis in the rTg4510 is not impacted by astroglial TFEB in the cortex or hippocampus at 4 mo of age. While astroglial TFEB overexpression did not impact tau pathology in our study of the aggressive rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model, we sought to determine if it may affect pathology in a slower progressing model such as the PS19. Unlike the rapid progression of tau pathology in the rTg4510 mice, the PS19 have a slower onset of pathology, with MC1 and AT8 immunofluorescence staining in the neuronal cell body reliably present at 6–8 mo and robust at 9 mo of age (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>; <Holmes et al., 2014>). Using a similar experimental design described for the rTg4510 mice, PS19 pups were injected ICV with AAV-GFAP-TFEB or AAV-GFAP-EGFP at P3 and analyzed at 9 mo of age. Tau pathology was analyzed biochemically and histologically, as was reactive gliosis. Total hippocampal brain lysates indicated on Western blot a reduction in phospho-tau species recognized by AT8 (trending), AT180, and CP13 antibodies in the TFEB-injected mice (<Fig. 6, A and B>). Following fractionation, immunoblotting for phospho and total tau species in the soluble pool similarly showed a significant reduction in phospho-tau species recognized by CP13 and PHF1 antibodies, with no change in total tau (<Fig. 6, C and D>). In the insoluble fraction, phospho- and total tau species were all reduced in the TFEB mice, as demonstrated by Western blot (<Fig. 6, C and E>). Immunostaining with phospho-tau antibody CP13 revealed a distinct difference in staining pattern when comparing the TFEB- and EGFP-injected mice (<Fig. 6 F> and Fig. S3 G). In particular, the majority of 9-mo-old PS19 mice injected with AAV-EGFP had abundant cell body CP13 staining in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (<Fig. 6 F>). In contrast, cell body staining was absent in the CA3 region of AAV-TFEB–injected mice with instead prominent mossy fiber staining present (<Fig. 6 F>). The staining patterns described correspond well with those reported in the PS19 mice studied in <Shi et al. (2017)>. Accordingly, the prominent mossy fiber staining in the CA3 of the TFEB-injected mice indicate a type 1 pattern, associated with earlier stages of pathology, while the cell body staining in the CA3 region and the dense staining over the entire hippocampus of the EGFP-injected mice indicate the more severe type 2 and type 4 pattern of pathology, respectively. The distribution of the CP13 staining patterns indicated patterns associated with later stage pathology were more abundant in EGFP-injected mice, while earlier stage, less severe phospho-tau staining patterns were present in the TFEB-injected mice (<Fig. 6 G>). With respect to phospho-tau staining in the cortex of these mice, a trending reduction in the area of CP13 staining is observed in the TFEB-injected group (<Fig. 6 H>). In line with a reduction in tau pathology, gliosis was also reduced in the hippocampus though not in the cortex, as shown by GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining (<Fig. 6, I–L>). Overall, these results show that astroglial TFEB overexpression reduces tau pathology and gliosis in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice. rhetorical Figure 6.

While astroglial TFEB overexpression did not impact tau pathology in our study of the aggressive rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model, we sought to determine if it may affect pathology in a slower progressing model such as the PS19. Unlike the rapid progression of tau pathology in the rTg4510 mice, the PS19 have a slower onset of pathology, with MC1 and AT8 immunofluorescence staining in the neuronal cell body reliably present at 6–8 mo and robust at 9 mo of age (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>; <Holmes et al., 2014>). Using a similar experimental design described for the rTg4510 mice, PS19 pups were injected ICV with AAV-GFAP-TFEB or AAV-GFAP-EGFP at P3 and analyzed at 9 mo of age. Tau pathology was analyzed biochemically and histologically, as was reactive gliosis. Total hippocampal brain lysates indicated on Western blot a reduction in phospho-tau species recognized by AT8 (trending), AT180, and CP13 antibodies in the TFEB-injected mice (<Fig. 6, A and B>). Following fractionation, immunoblotting for phospho and total tau species in the soluble pool similarly showed a significant reduction in phospho-tau species recognized by CP13 and PHF1 antibodies, with no change in total tau (<Fig. 6, C and D>). In the insoluble fraction, phospho- and total tau species were all reduced in the TFEB mice, as demonstrated by Western blot (<Fig. 6, C and E>). Immunostaining with phospho-tau antibody CP13 revealed a distinct difference in staining pattern when comparing the TFEB- and EGFP-injected mice (<Fig. 6 F> and Fig. S3 G). In particular, the majority of 9-mo-old PS19 mice injected with AAV-EGFP had abundant cell body CP13 staining in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (<Fig. 6 F>). In contrast, cell body staining was absent in the CA3 region of AAV-TFEB–injected mice with instead prominent mossy fiber staining present (<Fig. 6 F>). The staining patterns described correspond well with those reported in the PS19 mice studied in <Shi et al. (2017)>. Accordingly, the prominent mossy fiber staining in the CA3 of the TFEB-injected mice indicate a type 1 pattern, associated with earlier stages of pathology, while the cell body staining in the CA3 region and the dense staining over the entire hippocampus of the EGFP-injected mice indicate the more severe type 2 and type 4 pattern of pathology, respectively. The distribution of the CP13 staining patterns indicated patterns associated with later stage pathology were more abundant in EGFP-injected mice, while earlier stage, less severe phospho-tau staining patterns were present in the TFEB-injected mice (<Fig. 6 G>). With respect to phospho-tau staining in the cortex of these mice, a trending reduction in the area of CP13 staining is observed in the TFEB-injected group (<Fig. 6 H>)."
PMC6122971_7,"In line with a reduction in tau pathology, gliosis was also reduced in the hippocampus though not in the cortex, as shown by GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining (<Fig  6, I–L>). Overall, these results show that astroglial TFEB overexpression reduces tau pathology and gliosis in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice. Since astroglial TFEB overexpression reduces overall pathology in a slower progressing transgenic mouse model, we sought to determine if it may also affect tau spreading. To assess the role of astroglial TFEB in tau spreading, we designed an in vivo tau spreading assay based on a previously published model of pff induced NFT transmission in mice (<Iba et al., 2013>). In this case, pffs were delivered via stereotaxic injection into the left hippocampus of 3-mo-old PS19 tauopathy mice. This resulted in a reliable tau spreading model with ipsilateral hippocampal pathology within 1–2 wk (<Iba et al., 2013>) and contralateral pathology starting at 3 wk (Fig. S4, A and B). As mentioned before, the PS19 have a slower onset of pathology, with MC1 and AT8 immunofluorescence staining reliably present at 6–8 mo and robust at 9 mo of age (Fig. S4 C; <Yoshiyama et al., 2007>; <Holmes et al., 2014>). Thus, the MC1 and phospho-tau staining in the tau spreading assay should be exclusively pff-induced tau pathology up to 2 mo after fibril injection (5 mo of age; Fig. S4 C). To test the impact of astroglial TFEB, PS19 mice underwent P3 ICV injections of AAV-GFAP-TFEB or EGFP as described for the rTg4510 mice. At 3 mo of age these mice were subjected to stereotaxic injections of tau pffs in the left hippocampus (Fig. S5 A; <Lein et al., 2007>). At 1 mo after pff injections, we observed MC1 staining in the ipsilateral hippocampus, with less MC1 positivity in the contralateral hippocampus for both TFEB and EGFP groups (<Fig. 7 A>). Quantifying the area fluorescence of MC1 staining for both hippocampi from sections representing the entire volume of hippocampus showed that astroglial TFEB had no impact on MC1 staining on the ipsilateral side, but significantly reduced the area of MC1 staining on the contralateral side (<Fig. 7, A and C>). Similar results were observed with immunofluorescence using phospho-tau antibody AT8 (Fig. S5, B and E). Progressing from 1 mo to 2 mo after injection resulted in overall worsening pathology in both groups. Interestingly, at the 2-mo post-pff injection time point, similar measurements showed a reduction in MC1 staining area in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi in the TFEB groups compared with EGFP controls (<Fig. 7 B, D>). Again, similar results are shown with AT8 antibody staining at 2 mo after pff injection (Fig. S5, C and F). In addition, X-34 staining, which labels β sheet structures in tangle-like pathology, was reduced in the TFEB-injected mice 2 mo after pff injection on both the ipsilateral and contralateral side (Fig. S5, D and G). These findings indicate that while astroglial TFEB does not seem to impact the initial seeding of tau pathology in the ipsilateral hippocampus, tau spreading to the contralateral hippocampus is reduced at early time points, with both hippocampi demonstrating reduced tau pathology at the later time point. Correlated with a reduction in tau pathology at 2 mo after pff injection, TFEB-injected mice also have reduced gliosis in the hippocampus, as shown by reduced area fluorescence when staining for reactive astrocytes marker GFAP (<Fig. 7, E and G>) and microglial marker Iba1 (<Fig. 7, F and H>). In addition to a reduction in tau pathology/tau spreading, the TFEB-injected mice also demonstrate an increased incidence of astrocytes with AT8 positive phospho-tau (<Fig. 8, A–C>). AT8-positive tau was found to colocalize with lysosomal marker LAMP1 in AAV-TFEB transduced hippocampal astrocytes (<Fig. 8 D>). Overall, the results from the tau spreading model demonstrate that astroglial TFEB reduces tau spreading and reactive gliosis and also increases astroglial engulfment of phospho-tau in vivo. rhetorical Figure 7.

Overall, the results from the tau spreading model demonstrate that astroglial TFEB reduces tau spreading and reactive gliosis and also increases astroglial engulfment of phospho-tau in vivo. TFEB activation is a known consequence of lysosomal stress/dysfunction as demonstrated in lysosomal storage disorders and pharmacologic inhibition of lysosomal acidification (<Sardiello et al., 2009>; <Song et al., 2013>). Whether due to normal aging, the lysosomal stress of accumulating protein aggregates, or Alzheimer’s disease–related mutations causing inadequate lysosomal acidification, lysosomal dysfunction has long been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (<Cuervo and Dice, 2000>; <Lee et al., 2010>, <2015>; <Coen et al., 2012>; <Wolfe et al., 2013>). Focusing specifically on astrocytes, we see evidence of TFEB activation in tauopathies: (1) sorted astrocytes from whole brain demonstrate transcriptional up-regulation of TFEB and several of its lysosomal target genes, and (2) TFEB nuclear localization in astrocytes is increased. Since astrocytes are not the predominant cell type harboring undegraded protein aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia, it is unlikely that this activation is mediated by lysosomal stress due to astroglial protein accumulation. Instead, the astrocyte is intimately associated with the neuronal synapse, both anatomically and metabolically, making it uniquely poised to modulate or respond to neuronally secreted tau and its trans-synaptic spreading (<Wu et al., 2016>). Astroglial TFEB activation could be due to several factors, including the presence of aberrant extracellular tau, as well as signals from a stressed neuron, or secreted inflammatory molecules (<Pastore et al., 2016>). The precise mechanism is unknown and warrants further investigation. Despite this activation of TFEB in tauopathy, the response is insufficient to reverse or even halt disease progression. Our findings suggest that enhancing the lysosomal pathway in astrocytes through TFEB overexpression can mitigate disease progression and reduce tau spreading.Our study demonstrates that astroglial TFEB overexpression prominently affects tau spreading, but has mixed results on tau pathology (rTg4510 vs. PS19 mice). Analysis of postmortem human brains suggest a stereotyped spatial progression of tau pathology via synaptic connections (<Braak and Braak, 1995>)."
PMC6122971_9,"The study of animal and cellular models of this process indicate a mechanism of trans-cellular tau pathology propagation, where aberrant tau produced in one cell is released extracellularly and enters another adjacent cell to seed tau aggregation (<Clavaguera et al , 2009>; <Frost et al., 2009>; <de Calignon et al., 2012>; <Kfoury et al., 2012>; <Liu et al., 2012>; <Iba et al., 2013>; <Wu et al., 2016>). Similar to other tau spreading models, the model used in our study relies on this noncell autonomous mechanism of tau pathology progression with extracellular aberrant tau serving in a crucial role. In contrast, the importance of extracellular tau in the pathogenesis of the rTg4510 or PS19 tau transgenic mice is not well-established. Possible explanations for the lack of efficacy of astroglial TFEB in the rTg4510 mice are the predominance of a cell autonomous mechanism in the pathogenesis of neuropathology or the model’s severity and rapid progression. However, given that astroglial TFEB overexpression seems to be more effective at reducing tau pathology in the less severe, slower progressing PS19 mice, the rTg4510 mice may have reached a disease stage too advanced to detect a difference between TFEB- and EGFP-injected groups. Others have similarly had success in targeting extracellular tau in PS19 tau transgenic mice. For example, passive tau immunization with antibodies designed to target extracellular tau effectively reduced tau pathology in the PS19 (<Yanamandra et al., 2013>, <2015>, <2017>). While these antibodies have been shown to target exogenously administered extracellular tau, mechanisms targeting intracellular tau cannot be ruled out and may be responsible in part for reducing pathology (<Sigurdsson, 2009>; <Yanamandra et al., 2013>). Nonetheless, the passive immunization studies and our work indicate that (1) extracellular tau may play a role in disease pathogenesis in transgenic mice as well as tau spreading mice, and (2) this implicit targeting of extracellular tau can be an effective method to halt the progression of tau pathology. However, as with the passive immunization, additional mechanisms independent of the direct targeting of extracellular tau may also factor into the observed effect. Astroglial TFEB overexpression, in addition to increasing cellular uptake and clearance of extracellular tau seeds, may also indirectly impact disease pathogenesis based on interactions with neurons, modulation of neuroinflammation, or other important disease modifying pathways, which are yet to be reported in this particular context.In terms of glial involvement in modulating tau spreading, initial studies implicate microglia in this process. Microglia are thought to engulf tau aggregates bound to anti-tau antibodies in passive immunization studies (<Funk et al., 2015>; <Yanamandra et al., 2015>), while another study postulates microglia may facilitate tau spreading via exosome secretion (<Asai et al., 2015>). However, little is known about astroglial involvement in tau spreading. Though microglia are typically thought of as the professional phagocytes of the CNS, astrocytes are also phagocytic cells (<Cahoy et al., 2008>). In fact, numerous studies have emphasized the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes in the uptake and clearance of Aβ (<Wyss-Coray et al., 2003>; <Basak et al., 2012>; <Li et al., 2014>). Furthermore, a prior study demonstrated targeted astroglial TFEB expression reduced plaque pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model through enhanced uptake and lysosomal clearance pathways (<Xiao et al., 2014>). With respect to tau, we observe that astroglial TFEB expression increases macropinocytosis of pffs, followed by enhanced delivery of engulfed tau to the lysosome for degradation. In vivo, the increased presence of phospho-tau in TFEB overexpressing astrocytes suggests that TFEB-induced astrocytic engulfment and clearance may be responsible for the reduction in tau spreading and modulation of overall tau pathology. However, whether or not the direct mechanism investigated in vitro is solely responsible for our in vivo findings or if indirect mechanisms may also contribute remains to be established. One possible alternative mechanism investigated is whether modifying astrocytes via TFEB overexpression would impact synaptic activity. Tau release has been linked to neuronal activity (<Pooler et al., 2013>; <Yamada et al., 2014>; <Wu et al., 2016>), and astrocytes are intimately associated with the synapse, even becoming functionally part of the synapse. Despite this potential link, our findings indicate that TFEB overexpression in astrocytes does not modulate neuronal activity or impact trans-synaptic tau spreading via this particular mechanism.In terms of our in vivo findings of reduced tau spreading with astroglial TFEB overexpression, one must consider the limitations of the in vivo tau spreading assay. While the propagation of tau pathology from the ipsilateral pff injection site to the contralateral side is meant to mimic progression of tau pathology that serves as the basis of Braak staging, the injection of micrograms of pffs into the hippocampus is far from being a physiological event. However, the initial impact of astroglial TFEB seems to be on contralateral pathology, rather than initial seeding on the ipsilateral side. Thus, astroglial TFEB is not directly impacting the injected pff seeding ability, but rather limiting the propagation process further downstream. Furthermore, the AT8 positive tau observed in astrocytes in our spreading model results from human tau expressed in the transgenic mice, not the injected tau pffs which do not contain this phospho-tau epitope. This impact on tau spreading eventually results in an attenuation of overall pathology at 2 mo after injection, impacting the ipsilateral and contralateral side. Another complicating matter in this particular spreading assay is that while the pattern of pathology suggests tau spreading to synaptically connected regions, trans-synaptic tau spreading is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of spreading in this model. Tau spreading via direct physical connections or through the extracellular space without specifically involving synapses cannot be ruled out (<Gousset et al., 2009>; <Yamada et al., 2011>; <Asai et al., 2015>). Which particular mechanism(s) of tau propagation astroglial TFEB predominantly impacts warrants further study. Nonetheless, while the in vivo tau spreading assay is artificial in nature, the propagation of pathology from the ipsilateral to contralateral side provides an experimental model in which to test interventions that can impact the spatial progression of tau pathology that is observed in Alzheimer’s disease and correlated with cognitive decline (<Grober et al., 1999>; <Giannakopoulos et al., 2003>).Overall, our work supports the premise that TFEB overexpression in astrocytes reduces tau spreading, possibly through targeting aberrant extracellular tau for uptake and degradation. In terms of physiological relevance, evidence from whole brain and sorted astrocytes suggests the endogenous TFEB lysosomal system represents an adaptive response to tau pathology. Although we demonstrate a functional role of astroglial TFEB overexpression in modulating tau pathology and spreading, future in vivo studies using astroglial TFEB loss-of-function mutants are necessary to fully understand the physiological role of astroglial TFEB in this process. Other cell-type specific TFEB knockouts, particularly in neurons and microglia, are also warranted to gain a comprehensive assessment of the role of TFEB in tau handling. Nonetheless, our findings in astroglial TFEB overexpression describe a novel role for astrocytes in modulating tau pathology and open new avenues for leveraging the lysosomal TFEB pathway for therapeutic development. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of astroglial TFEB on tau pathology. We studied the effects on two aspects of tauopathy, general tau pathology and tau spreading, using the rTg4510 and PS19 transgenic mouse models, respectively. All control mice were littermates to experimental mice."
PMC6122971_10,"Astroglial TFEB overexpression was achieved via ICV injections of AAV at P3  The PS19 mice additionally underwent unilateral hippocampal injections of pffs at 3 mo of age to create the tau spreading model. Mice were randomly assigned to TFEB or EGFP treatment groups. Both sexes were analyzed. Animals were housed in groups of five animals maximum per cage. Investigators were blinded to study group identity during experiments, data collection, and analysis. In vitro experiments were repeated a minimum of two to three times, while in vivo experiments were either repeated, analyzed at different time points with similar results, or corroborating experiments were performed with separate cohorts of mice. Sample size was determined based on experience with similar studies (<Polito et al., 2014>) and/or power analysis described in Statistics. Postmortem brain tissue (mid frontal cortex) from subjects with FTD (including PSP, CBD, and Pick’s disease) and normal subjects were provided in the form of frozen blocks by Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at the University of Pennsylvania (demographic information listed below). Brains were considered normal based on the following criteria: exclusion of schizophrenia and fetal cases, confirmed Braak stage = 1 or 0 and CERAD = 0. Brains were designated as FTD (including CBD, PSP, and Pick’s disease) based on the following criteria: exclude secondary pathology, exclude CERAD >0, medial frontal cortex tau 3+ or 2+, and confirmed sporadic disease. Demographic data are included in Table S1. Each brain was homogenized in 1 ml RIPA (∼1:10 wt/vol) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). For RNA extraction, frozen tissue was homogenized in TRIzol using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). All protocols involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. rTg4510 mice were obtained from Jackson Labs and maintained by crossing the transactivator line CaMKIIα (129S6 background) with the tau responder line (FVB background; <Ramsden et al., 2005>; <SantaCruz et al., 2005>). Wild-type littermates were used as controls. PS19 mice were obtained from Jackson Labs (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>). Heterozygotes were bred to B6C3F1/J wild-type mice to maintain the line. The conditional tcfeb-flox mice were a generous gift from A. Ballabio (Telethon Institutes of Genetics and Medicine, Naples, Italy; <Settembre et al., 2012>) and crossed to nestin-Cre mice from Jackson Labs. Control mice were littermate tcfeb-flox homozygotes without the cre. CP13, PHF1, and MC1 antibodies were generous gifts from Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). All other antibodies were purchased from commercial sources described in Table S2. Astrocytes were isolated from 4.5-mo-old wild-type and rTg4510 (n = 9) mice as described previously (<Swartzlander et al., 2018>). In brief, mice were anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold saline. The forebrain was dissected and then finely minced using a razor blade. The minced forebrain was resuspended in HBSS and enzymatically digested in a solution containing papain (LK003178; Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and DNase. The suspension was then triturated with a glass Pasteur pipette to mechanically dissociate the minced forebrain. Cellular debris and myelin were removed by filtration through a 40-µm filter and centrifugation in 21% isotonic percoll resulting in a pellet of single cells. To isolate astrocytes from the dissociated singles cells, the cells were first blocked in HBSS with 0.5% BSA and mouse Fc Block (BD Biosciences) before staining for viability with LIVE/DEAD blue (L23105; Thermo Fisher) and with the fluorescent antibodies CD45 and ACSA-2. Approximately 200,000 live ACSA-2 positive, CD45 negative astrocytes were isolated per brain through FACS using a BD FACSAria II. GSEA was performed as previously described (<Subramanian et al., 2005>). Microarray data were obtained as described in our previous work (<Polito et al., 2014>) and is available in the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession no.: GSE53480). The cumulative distribution function was constructed by performing 1,000 random gene set membership assignments. A nominal P value of <0.01 and an FDR of <10% were used to assess the significance of the enrichment score (ES). The lists that define TFEB targets and TFEB lysosomal targets were obtained from previous studies (<Sardiello et al., 2009>; <Palmieri et al., 2011>). The human reprocessed RNA-seq data from the parahippocampal gyrus was generated by the MSSM and available on Synapse as part of the AMP-AD consortium (Synapse ID: syn8484987, download date March 27, 2017 and March 29, 2017). Samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) >6 were included in the analysis. The cohort was divided in to groups based on cognition and Braak staging. For cognition, there was no cognitive impairment (NCI; n = 23; RIN = 7.3 ± 0.1), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 23; RIN = 7.2 ± 0.1), and dementia (n = 84; RIN = 7.1 ± 0.1). The breakdown for Braak stages 1–6 were as follows: 1 (n = 12; RIN = 7.3 ± 0.1), 2 (n = 25; RIN = 7.0 ± 0.1), 3 (n = 25; RIN = 7.1 ± 0.1), 4 (n = 15; RIN = 7.1 ± 0.2), 5 (n = 13; RIN = 7.9 ± 0.2), and 6 (n = 27; RIN = 6.9 ± 0.1). For the entire cohort (n = 130) analyzed, the average RIN score is 7.1 ± 0.1. Statistics on genes of interest are described in the Statistics section. Murine cortices and hippocampi were isolated from P2 pups for astrocyte culture. The forebrain was dissected in ice-cold dissection medium (HBSS with 10 mM Hepes, 0.6% glucose, and 1% vol/vol Pen/Strep) and finely minced. The tissue was digested in 2.5% trypsin at 37°C for 15 min, followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml) and DNase. The tissue was then centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min, triturated, and resuspended in astrocyte culture media (DMEM + 10% FBS). Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (PDL)–coated T75 flasks at 50,000 cells/cm2. The mixed glial culture was allowed to reach confluency before shaking at 250 rpm overnight at 37°C to remove unwanted cells types (microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and fibroblasts). After a 24-h recovery in fresh media, astrocytes were trypsinized in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and replated onto appropriate PDL-coated vessels for experiments. Media was changed every 3–5 d. The same procedure as described for primary astrocyte culture was followed with noted exceptions. Confluent mixed glial cultures were shaken for 2 h at 250 rpm at 37°C. The T-75 flasks were then tapped vigorously 10–15 times on the bench top to loosen microglia growing on top of the astrocytes. The media along with floating microglia were collected from the flask and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 g. The cell pellet from one T-75 flask was resuspended in 3 ml of astrocyte culture media and plated in 3 wells of a PDL coated 12-well plate. The media was changed 24 h later. After 48–72 h in culture, microglia were collected for experiments. P0 pups were used for neuronal culture. The dissection procedure for primary astrocyte culture was followed with the noted exception of using neuronal culture media (neurobasal media + B-27 supplement + pen/strep + l-glutamine) instead of astrocyte media. Media on primary neurons was changed after 24 h. Weekly, fresh media of half the total volume of the well was added. Neurons were harvested at 18 days in vitro for experiments. Human TFEB coding sequence containing a C-terminal 3×FLAG tag was cloned into pAAV-GFAP-EGFP by replacing the EGFP sequence. Both pAAV-GFAP-TFEB3×FLAG and pAAV-GFAP-EGFP vectors were used to generate AAV 2/8 by the Gene Vector Core (Baylor College of Medicine). Serotype 8 AAVs were prepared by the transfection of three plasmids (transfer vector, p5E18-VD2/8 Rep-Cap plasmid, and pAdΔF6 helper plasmid) using iMFectin Poly DNA Transfection Reagent (GenDEPOT). AAV purification was performed by the method developed by Ayuso et al., with modifications (<Ayuso et al., 2010>). AAVs were dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline without Mg2+ and Ca2+, and the titer was determined by real time PCR as described previously (<Ljungberg et al."
PMC6122971_11,", 2012>) For AAV transduction in primary astrocytes, AAV was added to reduced serum medium (DMEM + 2% FBS) at 500,000 multiplicity of infection in half the usual volume for the particular surface area. Following 4–6 h of incubation, equal amount of fresh astrocyte medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) was added to the culture. Media was then changed 48 h after the addition of AAV. Astrocytes were cultured an additional 5–7 d before performing experiments to reach optimal TFEB or EGFP expression levels. Transduction efficiency was observed at >80% for these in vitro studies. Total RNA was extracted from primary astrocytes using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng total RNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). For hippocampal brain samples, TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA and cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg total RNA. cDNA was diluted to 2 ng/µL and 4 µl were added to 10 µl 2× FastStart Universal SYBR Green PCR Master (Roche). Each sample was run in triplicate using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Ct values were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH, which was amplified in parallel. The 2−ΔΔCT method was used to calculate relative gene expression levels. The following qRT-PCR primers were used: TFEB, 5′- TCAGAAGCGAGAGCTAACAGAT-3′ and 5′-TGTGATTGTCTTTCTTCTGCCG-3′; LAMP1, 5′-CAGCACTCTTTGAGGTGAAAAAC-3′ and 5′-ACGATCTGAGAACCATTCGCA-3′; MCOLN1 5′-CTGACCCCCAATCCTGGGTAT-3′ and 5′-GGCCCGGAACTTGTCACAT-3′; CTSA, 5′-CCCTCTTTCCGGCAATACTCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGCTGTTCTTTGGGTC-3′; CTSB, 5′-TCCTTGATCCTTCTTTCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-ACAGTGCCACACAGCTTCTTC-3′; CTSD, 5′-GCTTCCGGTCTTTGACAACCT-3′ and 5′-CACCAAGCATTAGTTCTCCTCC-3′; ATP6V1H, 5′-GGATGCTGCTGTCCCAACTAA-3′ and 5′-TCTCTTGCTTGTCCTCGGAAC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′; human TFEB, 5′-CCAGAAGCGAGAGCTCACAGAT-3′ and 5′-TGTGATTGTCTTTCTTCTGCCG-3′; human LAMP1, 5′-ACGTTACAGCGTCCAGCTCAT-3′ and 5′-TCTTTGGAGCTCGCATTGG-3′; human CTSB, 5′-AGTGGAGAATGGCACACCCTA-3′ and 5′-AAGAAGCCATTGTCACCCCA-3′; human CTSD, 5′-AACTGCTGGACATCGCTTGCT-3′ and 5′-CATTCTTCACGTAGGTGCTGGA-3′; human GAPDH, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′. For Western blot, cells, forebrain, or dissected hippocampus were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (TBS with 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails [Roche]). Lysates were sonicated six pulses at 50% duty cycle and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min. Supernatants were collected and quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Lysates were incubated 7 min at 90°C in sample loading buffer. 15-µg protein samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Blots were probed with primary antibody, washed with PBS-T, and then probed with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by additional washes. The signal was developed with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher) and detected using x-ray films. Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and normalized to the loading control (γ-tubulin or β-actin). The loading control normalized samples were then normalized to the average of either wild-type or EGFP samples, so that wild-type or EGFP samples would average to 1. The values reported are relative to the control (either EGFP or wild type). The hippocampus was dissected from 9-mo-old PS19 mice injected with AAV at P3. The hippocampus was weighed for each of the mice and recorded to later use to normalize the loading of the soluble fraction. The tissue was suspended in 350 µl of TBS with 10% sucrose + protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and disrupted using a handheld homogenizer. The mixture was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in the same volume of the above buffer and centrifuged again under the same conditions. Supernatants from the two steps were pooled together and 700 µl of the solution from each mouse underwent ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatants from ultracentrifugation were collected as the soluble fractions. Pellets from the ultracentrifugation were resuspended in 700 µl of 1% sarkosyl in TBS with protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails, sonicated, incubated in shaking for 30 min, and ultracentrifuged again at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. Pellets from the second ultracentrifugation step were resuspended in 150 µl of 1% SDS, sonicated and kept as the insoluble fraction. The soluble fraction loading volume was normalized based on the weight of the hippocampus. The insoluble fraction was loaded in equal volumes for all samples. 30 µl of insoluble fractions per gel were added to 4× sample loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 7 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Primary astrocytes were incubated with 100 nM Lysotracker red (Life Technologies) for 1 h before trypsinization and harvested for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis was completed in the Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core (Baylor College of Medicine) on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). BD FACSDiva 8.0.1 software was used to analyze 20,000 events/sample. Primary astrocytes were also incubated with 1 µg/ml DQ Red BSA (Life Technologies) for 3 h followed by flow cytometry analysis. Primary astrocytes were incubated with red fluorescent latex beads, amine-modified polystyrene of 1.0 µm mean particle size (Sigma) for 1 h in starvation medium (HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ + 10 mM Hepes + 1% vol/vol Pen/Strep) at 0.01% (vol/vol). Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove beads on the cell surface. Astrocytes were then trypsinized and subjected to flow cytometry analysis (20,000 events/sample). Recombinant tau fibrils or pffs were prepared as described previously (<Li and Lee, 2006>; <Xu et al., 2016>). In brief, truncated human tau containing only four microtubule-binding repeats (4R) with a 5′ Myc tag and P301L MAPT mutation (5′Myc-K18/P301L) was cloned into pRK172 for bacterial expression. The protein was purified and underwent in vitro fibrillization by mixing recombinant tau with heparin. Fibrillization was confirmed using the thioflavin T fluorescence assay, sedimentation test, and cryo-electron microscopy. For cryo-electron microscopy, 5 µl of K18PL pffs was added to carbon coated grids. Pffs were imaged on a Jeol JEM2100 laB6 transmission electron microscope at 15,000× magnification. Following confirmation, the pffs were frozen as single use aliquots (40 µM) at −80°C. Before use in experiments, frozen aliquots were thawed followed by sonication of 30 brief pulses. The sonicated tau fibrils were then dye conjugated to AlexaFluor-647 using an AlexaFluor-647 Protein Labeling kit (Life Technologies). The dye-conjugated pffs were eluted with PBS and collected for further experiments. Dye conjugation of tau fibrils was confirmed via Western blot for Myc and total tau. Primary astrocytes were incubated in starvation medium 1 h before the addition of AlexaFluor-647 pffs (500 nM). Cells were incubated with dye-conjugated pffs for 1 or 4 h, then washed with ice-cold PBS three times before trypsinization for the removal of cell surface associated pffs and detachment of cells. Harvested cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis (20,000 events/sample). For heparin treatment, primary astrocytes received 100 µg/ml heparin (Sigma) along with the dye-conjugated pffs in starvation medium for 1 h before washout, trypsinization, and flow cytometry analysis.For Torin1 experiments, astrocytes were treated with 250 nM Torin1 in astrocyte culture medium for 3 h prior to addition of pffs (as described above). Astrocytes were incubated with Torin1 and pffs for 1 h before washout, trypsinization, and harvest for flow cytometry."
PMC6122971_12,"Primary astrocytes grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature after multiple washes with ice-cold PBS  Following fixation, coverslips were gently washed with PBS. Coverslips were then incubated in blocking buffer (PBS + 2% donkey serum + 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (FLAG, 1:1,000; LAMP1, 1:50) overnight in blocking buffer at 4°C. Coverslips were then washed in PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor-488; anti-rat IgG AlexaFluor-555 [Invitrogen]) for 2 h in blocking buffer at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed in PBS and mounted using DAPI containing mounting media. Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SPE). For colocalization analysis, Coloc2 plugin from ImageJ was used to calculate number of colocalized pixels of LAMP1 and pffs-647. Fields of view were randomly selected at 40× for a total of 12 images per group, and the number of colocalized pixels were averaged for each group.Mice were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% PFA, and the brains were collected and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA followed by dehydration in 30% sucrose. The brains were then sectioned on a sliding microtome in 30-µm increments. The sections underwent extensive washing in TBS before addition of primary antibody (FLAG, 1:250; MC1, 1:500; AT8, 1:500; Iba1, 1:1,000; NeuN, 1:1,000; and GFAP, 1:1,000) in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed in TBS followed by incubation with secondary fluorescence antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After a final wash in TBS, floating sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides and allowed to dry before adding mounting medium containing DAPI. Sections were imaged by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SPE). The Leica TCS SPE is equipped with a 405-, 488-, 561-, and 635-nm laser lines and HC PL APO 10×/0.40, HC PL APO 20×/0.70 CS, ACS APO 40×/1.15 OIL CS, ACS APO 63×/1.30 OIL CS objectives. The X-34 staining protocol was adapted from a previous publication (<Styren et al., 2000>). Free floating sections cut at 30-µm thickness were incubated in a 40% ethanol staining solution containing 10 µM X-34 (SML1954; Sigma) for 10 min. Excess X-34 was rinsed off with PBS, and sections were mounted on microscope slides with Fluoromount-G (00-4958-02; Thermo Fisher). Free-floating tissue sections were incubated at 4°C overnight in a solution containing CP13 antibody at a 1:250 dilution, 2% donkey serum, and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS. The primary solution was washed off with three washes of PBS before incubating in a 1:1,000 dilution of biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (BA-2000; Vector) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were washed again and incubated in the Vectastain ABC kit (PK-6100; Vector) following their protocol for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were then washed twice with PBS and twice more with 0.1 M sodium acetate before being submerged in the staining solution for 60 s. The chemical staining solution consists of 4 ml distilled water, 5 ml of 5% nickel ammonium sulfate, 10 mg DAB (D8001; Sigma), and 5 µl of 30% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was quenched in 0.1 M sodium acetate before washing in PBS and mounting on slides with mounting media. TFEB nuclear localization was calculated based on counting instances of DAPI and FLAG staining colocalization and dividing by total number of FLAG-positive cells per confocal image, averaged for each animal (five images per animal, n = 5). Colocalization was determined based on multiple z-stack slices (20 slices per 30-µm section). Random areas of the cortex and hippocampus were selected for imaging at 40×.Number of astrocytes containing tau in EGFP and TFEB tau spreading mice were calculated based on counting number of astrocytes with colocalization of GFAP and AT8 staining. Colocalization was determined based on confocal microscropy of multiple z-stack slices (30 slices per 30-µm section). Random areas of the hippocampus were selected for imaging at 40× (40 images per group, n = 4).For calculating area fluorescence of GFAP, Iba1, MC1, and AT8 antibody staining, the slide containing representative slices of the entire mouse brain was scanned on an EVOS fluorescence microscope. Area fluorescence in specific brain regions was calculated after thresholding to eliminate background and nonspecific staining using ImageJ. Area fluorescence of GFAP, Iba1, MC1, or AT8 staining in the cortex or hippocampus was averaged across all consistently represented sections for each animal to signify the relative pathology or gliosis within the entire volume of the brain region analyzed. The hippocampus and cortex were thresholded separately. Pups at P3 were anesthetized via hypothermia before bilateral ICV injections. Anesthetized pups were injected free-hand with 1010 viral particles per side of AAV2/8-GFAP-TFEB or AAV2/8-GFAP-EGFP using at 28-gauge needle attached to a Hamilton syringe. CTSD activity was measured using a CTSD enzyme assay kit (Ab65302; Abcam). 25 µg of protein homogenate was adjusted to 50 µl per well with cell lysis buffer (provided in the kit) for experimental samples. 50 µl of reaction buffer (provided in the kit) per reaction well was added to the protein homogenate. 50 µl of reaction buffer with 50 µl lysis buffer per reaction well without protein homogenate was used as a negative control or blank. Finally, 2 µl substrate (provided in the kit) was added to each reaction well including the blanks and excitation/emission (Ex/Em) = 328/460 was measured using a Synergy 2 Multi-Detection Microplate Reader and samples were left to incubate at 37°C in dark, before taking the reading for the next time point. Fluorescence was measured in technical triplicates from n = 5 samples per genotype at the indicated times. Appropriate calculations to measure first-order rate constant (k) of enzymatic reaction were obtained upon subtracting blank fluorescence units from the values of the experimental wells. In brief, adult 9-mo-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and placed into ice-cold modified NMDG solution (composition in mM: 110 NMDG, 110 HCl, 3 KCl, 10 MgCl2 6*H2O, 1.1 NaH2PO4 H2O, 0.5 CaCl2 dihydrate, 25 glucose, 3 pyruvic acid, 10 ascorbic acid, 25 NaHCO3, and 305–310 mOsm; <Ting et al., 2014>; <Miller et al., 2017>). 350-µm horizontal hippocampal sections were harvested using Leica VT1200S vibratome. Immediately after slicing, slices were allowed to recover in oxygenated (95% oxygen and 5% CO2) NMDG for 30 min at 34°C, followed by another 30-min incubation in bicarbonate buffered ACSF (composition in mM: 124 NaCl, 4 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.26 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgCl2, and 2 CaCl2) at room temperature before recording. ACSF solutions were bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 at all times to maintain consistent oxygenation and pH.To record sEPSCs, pipettes were filled with a cesium-substituted intracellular solution (mM): 10 CsCl, 105 CsMeSO3, 0.5 ATP, 0.3 GTP, 10 Hepes, 5 glucose, 2 MgCl2, and 1 EGTA. Neurons were held at the measured GABA reversal potential (−65 mV), corrected for liquid junction potential (<Chen et al., 2016>). No drugs were included in the bath. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were acquired (MultiClamp 700B; Axon Instruments) and digitized sampled at 20 kHZ (Digidata 1550; Axon Instruments), filtered at 2 kHz and acquired with pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Pipette resistances ranged from 4 to 7 MΩ Access resistance ranged from 8 to 20 MΩ and was monitored for consistency; for analyzed cells, change was never >20%. Recordings were discarded if the initial leak current was >200 pA or changed by >20% over the course of recording. Off-line analysis was performed using Clampfit. PS19 pups underwent bilateral ICV injections at P3 with AAV2/8-GFAP-TFEB or AAV2/8-GFAP-EGFP as described above. In brief, 3-mo-old PS19 mice were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed in a Kopf stereotaxic device (Model 940) to secure the temporal bone."
PMC6122971_13,"A microinjection pipette (Nanoject II; Drummond Scientific) was used to aseptically inject 2 0 µl of pffs into the left hippocampus (stereotaxic coordinates from bregma: −2.5 mm posterior, −2.0 mm lateral, and −1.8 mm ventral) at a flow rate of 50 nanoliters every 6 s. The needle was pulled vertically in 0.6-mm increments during removal to reduce off target tau seeding in the cortex due to capillary action from needle withdrawal. All data are presented as ±SEM. Power analysis was performed using a confidence interval of α = 0.05. Pairwise comparisons were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test.

Martini-Stoica et al. demonstrate that the TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway in astrocytes is increased in tauopathy and plays a functional role in modulating extracellular tau and the propagation of neuronal tau pathology in a mouse model of tau spreading. The progression of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease follows a stereotyped pattern, and recent evidence suggests a role of synaptic connections in this process. Astrocytes are well positioned at the neuronal synapse to capture and degrade extracellular tau as it transits the synapse and hence could potentially have the ability to inhibit tau spreading and delay disease progression. Our study shows increased expression and activity of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in response to tau pathology in both human brains with dementia and transgenic mouse models. Exogenous TFEB expression in primary astrocytes enhances tau fibril uptake and lysosomal activity, while TFEB knockout has the reverse effect. In vivo, induced TFEB expression in astrocytes reduces pathology in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice, as well as prominently attenuates tau spreading from the ipsilateral to the contralateral hippocampus in a mouse model of tau spreading. Our study suggests that astrocytic TFEB plays a functional role in modulating extracellular tau and the propagation of neuronal tau pathology in tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease. ."
PMC3190966_0,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that accumulates in at least 15 different neurodegenerative disorders, which are collectively referred to as tauopathies. In these diseases, tau is often hyperphosphorylated and found in aggregates, including paired helical filaments, neurofibrillary tangles and other abnormal oligomers. Tau aggregates are associated with neuron loss and cognitive decline, which suggests that this protein can somehow evade normal quality control allowing it to aberrantly accumulate and become proteotoxic. Consistent with this idea, recent studies have shown that molecular chaperones, such as heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90, counteract tau accumulation and neurodegeneration in disease models. These molecular chaperones are major components of the protein quality control systems and they are specifically involved in the decision to retain or degrade many proteins, including tau and its modified variants. Thus, one potential way to treat tauopathies might be to either accelerate interactions of abnormal tau with these quality control factors or tip the balance of triage towards tau degradation. In this review, we summarize recent findings and suggest models for therapeutic intervention. The authors thank Erik Zuiderweg, Bill Pratt and members of our laboratories for helpful conversations. Tauopathies are a family of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the appearance of aggregates of the microtubule-associating protein, tau. These diseases include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, as well as devastating diseases such as frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 and progressive supranuclear palsy [<1>–<5>]. In these diseases, tau is found in aggregates termed paired helical filaments [<6>,<7>], which assemble into the neurofibrillary tangles that were originally described as ‘senile’ plaques in the neurons of AD patients [<8>].Numerous observations have converged on a model in which tau aggregation is important for clinical symptoms. For example, tau pathology closely correlates to neuron loss and cognitive deficits [<9>,<10>]. Furthermore, the post-translationally modified forms of tau (e.g., hyperphosphorylated and/or proteolyzed) that are enriched in paired helical filaments and neurofibrillary tangles are also more prone to self-assemble in vitro [<11>]. Finally, fronto-temporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 is directly linked to point mutations that make tau more aggregation-prone. Together, these observations have led to the hypothesis that aggregation and abnormal accumulation of tau aggregates are significant contributing factors in tauopathies.Tau is a cytosolic protein that is abundantly expressed in neurons and found in at least 13 splice isoforms in the brain [<12>,<13>]. Its major cellular function is to stabilize microtubules and this activity has been found to be essential for axonal transport [<14>]. Tau is a member of a class of intrinsically disordered proteins, whose free structures are believed to be best represented by an ensemble of possible orientations with weak preference for any specific structural motif [<15>–<18>]. However, tau is likely to adopt local structure when bound to microtubules. This interaction occurs through the microtubule-binding repeats of tau, with the 3R and 4R splice isoforms having either three or four repeats, respectively. Consistent with the importance of this domain, mutations in the microtubule-binding repeats have been found to weaken tau binding, reducing microtubule stability and sometimes leading to neuron loss [<19>,<20>].Phosphorylation of tau by the kinases GSK3β, Cdk5 and MARK2 is a major regulator of its microtubule interactions [<21>–<24>]. GSK3β is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase involved in many signaling pathways, including signaling downstream of wnt, insulin and many G-protein-coupled receptors [<25>]. Cdk5 is another serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple pathways, including NMDA receptor and growth factor signaling. Cdk5 exists in two complexes in post-mitotic neurons, a prosurvival complex with p35 (Cdk5–p35) and an apoptotic complex with p25 (Cdk5–p25), the latter of which has stronger kinase activity [<22>,<26>,<27>]. Together, GSK3β and Cdk5 are thought to be major kinases of tau in the brain [<28>]. Importantly, MARK2-based phosphorylation of tau is accelerated by the priming activity of either Cdk5 or GSK3β [<29>], suggesting that tau phosphorylation involves a series of ordered kinase events. In general, phosphorylation of tau reduces its affinity for microtubules [<30>], while dephosphorylation via enzymes such as PP2A and PP5 restores binding [<30>,<31>]. This reversible cycle of association and dissociation is a normal cellular process that facilitates axonal transport [<30>–<33>]. However, hyperphosphorylated forms of tau are more prone to aggregate, which might decrease their solubility and remove them from normal cycling [<34>]. Furthermore, proteolytic processing of tau, by caspases, calpains and other enzymes, can significantly accelerate hyperphosphorylation and facilitate aggregation [<35>]. Thus, tauopathies might be considered as involving an imbalance in the normal processing of tau, which affects its microtubule binding, aggregation propensity, phosphorylation status and, ultimately, its turnover. There are no cures for any tauopathy. Neuroprotective agents, such as acetylcholin-esterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists, have been approved for use in the clinic, based on their ability to slow the rate of cognitive decline in patients with moderate to severe AD (reviewed in [<36>]). However, long-term strategies for tauopathies will likely need to focus on impacting the underlying, disease-causing accumulation of modified and aggregated tau (reviewed in [<37>,<38>]). For example, because of the importance of phosphorylation, there are a number of kinase inhibitors being explored as therapeutics for tauopathies [<39>]. Whether this strategy will be able to improve cognition without adverse effects on other cellular processes remains to be determined. Nevertheless, some studies targeting kinases have demonstrated promising early efficacy in patients (reviewed in [<40>]). In addition to kinase inhibitors, compounds that directly block the aggregation of tau are also being explored as potential therapeutics [<41>]. These efforts have produced early-stage molecules of multiple different chemical classes, including rhodanine-based inhibitors, phenylthiazolyl-hydrazides, N-phenylamines, anthraquinones, benzothiazoles, phenothiazines and polyphenols [<41>]. However, recent studies suggest that intermediate, soluble oligomers of tau might best correlate with disease, suggesting that any anti-aggregation strategy will have to selectively reduce the levels of these structures [<42>–<44>].Another possible way to treat tauopathies may be to manipulate the quality control pathways that regulate tau turnover. This hypothesis is based on the idea that tauopathies result, in part, from a failure of neurons to properly recognize and remove hyperphosphorylated and/or aggregated tau. All proteins, including tau, are subject to extensive regulation by the cellular quality control pathways, which carefully control the balance between protein expression and turnover to maintain healthy protein homeostasis (or proteostasis). Interestingly, tau clearance is known to be impaired in the aging brain [<45>], supporting the idea that diminished quality control might be conducive to certain tauopathies, such as AD, which are linked to aging. Based on this idea, one might imagine that pharmacologically accelerating tau degradation could be a possible strategy to relieve tauopathies. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that tau is essential for the neurotoxicity of amyloid-β, providing a possible link between these classic AD targets and suggesting that reductions in tau levels might be important via multiple, beneficial mechanisms [<46>–<48>]."
PMC3190966_1,"In this review, we will discuss some recent advances in this direction and discuss the strengths and challenges of this strategy  However, it is likely useful to first introduce the structure, function and ‘drugability’ of some of the key components of the quality control pathways: the molecular chaperones. Molecular chaperones are abundant and highly conserved proteins that assume an important role in protein quality control [<49>,<50>]. Several members of the chaperone family are upregulated in response to stress and, thus, these factors have been termed heat shock proteins (Hsps). The expression of Hsps is regulated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which, under stress conditions, becomes associated with heat shock elements to elevate the transcription of Hsps and other proteins [<51>]. Each class of Hsp is named according to its molecular weight; for example, Hsp27, Hsp70 and Hsp90. These proteins are thought to serve individual functions, while collectively they monitor most aspects of protein synthesis, folding, trafficking and assembly of multiprotein complexes (reviewed in [<52>]). Importantly, the Hsps are also critical at the end of a protein’s life, as they facilitate turnover by the proteasome system and the clearance of proteotoxic aggregates by autophagy [<53>]. Even under normal conditions, as much as 30% of newly synthesized polypeptides are degraded [<54>], suggesting that all proteins are in equilibrium between folding and degradation; a balance that is maintained, in part, by the Hsp molecular chaperones. Heat shock protein 70 is a major component in protein quality control and, as discussed below, a key factor in tau turnover. There are multiple, highly conserved Hsp70s in humans and members of this family of chaperones are abundant in all major organelles and the cytosol. Each Hsp70 is composed of a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) [<55>]. The NBD contains two lobes comprising a deep nucleotide-binding cleft that binds ATP. The SBD can be further divided into β-sandwich and α-helical lid subdomains, the latter of which contains a motif characterized by the amino acid EEVD that binds to tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. The NBD hydrolyzes ATP, while the SBD binds to hydrophobic regions of polypeptides via the β-sandwich subdomain [<56>]. It is thought that Hsp70 promiscuously binds to many hydrophobic polypeptides [<57>,<58>], including regions of tau adjacent to the microtubule-binding repeats [<59>]. A flexible linker connects the NBD and SBD and these domains appear to communicate via allostery. For example, with ATP bound to the NBD, the SBD has a weaker binding affinity for substrate polypeptides. The intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70 is very weak (~0.2 nmol/μg/min) [<60>] and, under physiological conditions, it is regulated by co-chaperones, including J-proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Briefly, J-proteins cause a conformational change in Hsp70s that accelerates ATP hydrolysis [<61>], while NEFs facilitate ADP release [<62>]. Finally, TPR domain-containing proteins are co-chaperones that bind to the EEVD motif and help dictate the fate of substrates bound to Hsp70. Thus, Hsp70s are part of a multiprotein complex that utilizes coordinated ATPase activity and multiple co-chaperone partners to shape interactions with misfolded substrates.Heat shock protein 70 has been the subject of recent efforts to develop chemical inhibitors [<52>,<63>] and a number of high throughput screening efforts have been reported [<60>,<64>–<67>]. Drug development on this emerging target is still in its early stages, with only a few potent and/or selective inhibitors described [<68>]. Most of the currently available chemical probes target the ATPase activity of Hsp70, through either competitive or noncompetitive allosteric mechanisms (<Figure 1>). For example, VER-155008 is an ATP-competitive compound developed by structure-guided design [<69>,<70>]. However, there is an indirect relationship between ATP turnover and chaperone functions [<71>], suggesting that other aspects of Hsp70 function might also be worth exploring for drug discovery. For example, our groups have identified compounds that operate at protein–protein interfaces to disrupt interactions with co-chaperones, such as 116-9e [<65>,<72>,<73>], while other inhibitors target the SBD to block binding to substrates, such as compound 7 [<74>,<75>]. As might be expected given the diverse mechanisms of these compounds, known Hsp70 inhibitors represent a variety of chemical classes, including dihydropyrimidines, adenosine analogs, polyamines and others (<Figure 1>) [<52>,<63>]. Moreover, many of these inhibitors, including methylene blue and MKT-077, have poorly understood mechanisms. Heat shock protein 90 has three domains: a 25-kDa N-terminal domain connected by a flexible, charged linker to the 40-kDa middle domain and 12-kDa C-terminal domain [<76>–<83>]. These three domains contain an ATP-binding pocket, a substrate peptide-binding site, and a TPR domain-binding EEVD motif, respectively. Recent structural studies have suggested that Hsp90 functions as a homodimer in which the C-terminal domains of two Hsp90 molecules are in contact at the bottom of the ‘V-shaped’ open conformer. As in the case of Hsp70, co-chaperones of Hsp90, such as Aha1, cdc37 and TPR domain-containing proteins, regulate its ATPase activity and control its conformational transitions (reviewed in [<84>]). Hsp90 is thought to have a more restricted set of substrates than Hsp70, but these clients include a number of important kinases and signaling proteins.Owing to its client pool, Hsp90 has become an established anticancer target, with a number of selective and potent inhibitors available [<85>,<86>]. Work on Hsp90 inhibitors benefited from the early discovery of the natural product, geldanamycin, which competes with ATP and induces destabilization of Hsp90-bound proteins [<87>]. Since this discovery, a number of high-affinity analogs, such as 17-AAG, and alternative synthetic scaffolds, including radicicol and PU-H71, have been reported (<Figure 1>) [<85>,<88>]. These compounds bind in either the N-terminal ATP-binding site (e.g., 17-AAG, radicicol and PU-H71) [<89>] or C-terminal dimerization domain (e.g., novobiocin and A4) [<90>,<91>], and they show great promise as both anticancer compounds and research tools for understanding Hsp90 biology. Several Hsp90 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, all of which target the N-terminal domain [<92>]. More recently, there has also been interest in developing compounds, such as celastrol (<Figure 1>), that selectively disrupt association of co-chaperones with Hsp90 as an alternative way to control chaperone activity [<93>–<96>]. Heat shock protein 27 is a member of the conserved, small heat shock protein family. These proteins are ATP-independent chaperones that undergo homo-oligomerization in response to stress [<97>,<98>]. Small heat shock proteins have been imaged by electron microscopy and these studies have revealed that some of these oligomers are ordered polyhedrons [<99>]. Furthermore, gel filtration and centrifugation studies have suggested that Hsp27 exists as an ensemble of oligomers, which range in size from dimers to approximately 32 mers or greater. Binding of susceptible substrates to the surface of these Hsp27 oligomers is thought to limit stress-induced aggregation and, thus, this chaperone is considered a ‘holdase’. To allow substrate release, Hsp27 oligomerization is reversible; a process that is regulated, at least in part, by phosphorylation. Like Hsp90 and Hsp70, Hsp27 plays important prosurvival roles; however, no drug-like molecules have been reported that target its activities or protein–protein interactions. During protein quality control, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp27 (and their co-chaperones) often work in concert. If prolonged misfolding is detected, the chaperones shuttle the protein to a degradation endpoint, such as the proteasome or autophagy."
PMC3190966_2,"This general model arises, in large part, from a series of seminal experiments on the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone system and how it regulates the nuclear hormone receptors [<100>,<101>]  In this model, a J-protein (also known as Hsp40) is thought to facilitate high-affinity substrate binding to Hsp70 by coordinating substrate delivery and ATP turnover (<Figure 2>) [<60>]. The action of an NEF then releases the substrate [<49>], which can either achieve its proper folding outcome, re-enter the Hsp70-based ATPase cycle, or be fated for subsequent steps in quality control. In these latter cases, an Hsp70-bound substrate can be transferred to Hsp90 via Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein (HOP) [<102>,<103>]. Alternatively, either Hsp70 or Hsp90 can recruit the ubiquitin E3 ligase, C-terminal Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP), to degrade the bound substrate [<104>]. During this triage process, certain substrates are known to require additional co-chaperones at distinct steps. For example, the co-chaperones cdc37, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family member, and p23 are all critical for the transfer of kinases to Hsp90 and maturation of the active protein [<76>,<105>]. In addition, Hsp90’s hydrolysis of ATP, which is stimulated by Aha1, facilitates polypeptide release [<82>,<106>] and transfer to CHIP or other E3 ligases [<107>,<108>]. Thus, protein quality control is thought to involve a series of ‘checkpoint’ steps that monitor substrate folding and enact triage decisions. These steps are defined by ATP/ADP cycling, changes in tertiary and quaternary structure, and fluctuation in the identity of associated co-chaperones.Although both Hsp70 and Hsp90 can promote degradation of client proteins, it has recently been shown that, functionally, the Hsp70 complex often dominates triage decisions [<85>,<107>,<109>]. Thus, Hsp70 may function as a primary checkpoint prior to entering the Hsp90-based complex for maturation. In this model, it may be helpful to simplify protein quality control as occuring in three phases: J-protein-directed recruitment; primary folding and triage in the Hsp70 complex; and secondary folding and function in the Hsp90 system (<Figure 2>). In theory, any of these steps might contain suitable drug targets for tauopathies. Tau cycling on/off microtubules and its proteolytic turnover are assisted by molecular chaperones and, thus, these proteins play an important role in its normal homeostasis [<110>,<111>]. However, under potentially proteotoxic conditions, the post-translational modifications or mutations that damage tau’s affinity for microtubules and favor its aggregation are thought to generate a molecular ‘danger signal’ that specifically alerts the quality control system [<112>,<113>]. As discussed above, this system then ‘decides’ to retain or degrade that substrate. In the case of abnormal tau, imbalances in this decision appear to allow accumulation, proteotoxicity and neuron loss (<Figure 3>). Here, we will review the evidence suggesting an essential ‘decision-making’ role for molecular chaperones in tau quality control and tauopathies. Hsp70 has been shown to both stabilize binding of tau to microtubules [<114>] and promote its degradation in combination with CHIP [<115>,<116>]. In addition, recent work has demonstrated that Hsc70, the constitutive cytosolic form of Hsp70s, also dynamically regulates the association of tau with microtubules [<112>]. These activities arise via direct binding of Hsp70s to the microtubule binding repeats [<59>]. This central role for Hsp70 family members in regulating tau cycling and triage suggests possible ways of tipping the balance. In fact, recent work from our group has shown that inhibition of the ATPase activity of Hsp70/Hsc70 promotes proteasomal degradation of tau; whereas activation results in tau accumulation [<117>]. Furthermore, one of these inhibitors was able to reduce phospho-tau levels and improve cognition in a transgenic mouse model [<44>]. Interestingly, these effects were observed without apparent toxicity, induction of HSF1 activity or adverse health effects on the animals, providing preliminary evidence that targeting Hsp70 may be a surprisingly viable pharmacological approach. However, many critical questions remain. For example, what is the molecular mechanism(s) by which inhibition of Hsp70 leads to tau degradation. How does Hsp70 selectively recognize abnormal tau from a pool of normal cycling tau. Speculative models to account for these interesting observations are elaborated upon in the last section of this review. Hsp90 was also shown to increase association of tau with microtubules [<114>]; however, its binding is not well characterized and it is not known whether this is a direct or indirect process. For example, it has recently been shown that Hsp90 promotes tau’s phosphorylation by its ability to stabilize GSK3β [<118>]. These data may suggest that Hsp90 allows accumulation of pathogenic tau species. However, this issue is more complicated, as other work has shown that chemical inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG and other inhibitors reduces cellular levels of two phospho-tau species, pS202/T205 and pS396/S404, both of which are relevant to AD pathogenesis [<119>]. In response to the inhibitors, tau clearance occurs via CHIP-mediated, proteasomal degradation [<119>–<121>]. In addition, other mutant forms of tau have also been particularly susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition, while wild-type tau is not [<122>]. Interestingly, it was recently found that reducing the levels of Akt, another client of the Hsp90/CHIP complex, facilitates tau degradation [<123>], suggesting a synchronized balance between competing Hsp90 substrates that may be driven, in part, by their relative abundance or susceptibility to Hsp90 binding.Together, multiple studies suggest that Hsp90 regulates the stability of both phospho- and mutant-tau. However, a greater effort needs to be made to elucidate the mechanisms driving the apparent preservation of aggregation-prone isoforms. Potential mechanisms and research avenues will be discussed in more detail later, but one interesting idea comes from studies implicating Hsp90 as a driving force in evolution via its ability to preserve mutant proteins [<124>]. If Hsp90 can buffer against mutations, whether deleterious or beneficial, then this suggests that it might be adopting a similar role in tau pathogenesis. In other words, Hsp90 inhibition may be able to ‘de-evolve’ the chaperone system to clear proteotoxic tau species. Hsp27 has emerged as a potential target for tau regulation based on early findings that it preferentially binds to phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated tau and promotes their clearance [<125>,<126>]. However, astrocyte-derived Hsp27 has been shown to promote tau accumulation and Hsp27 associates with tau tangles in a mouse model [<127>,<128>], suggesting a more complex relationship. Recently, our group demonstrated that viral delivery of wild-type Hsp27 into the brains of tau-transgenic mice reduced tau levels and rescued long-term potentiation deficits. Conversely, delivery of a mock-phosphorylated mutant Hsp27 caused increased tau levels [<129>]. This study suggests that Hsp27 may need to cycle between phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated states to promote tau clearance, perhaps explaining the apparent contradictions observed previously. Until more is known about the structure and biology of Hsp27, and why certain multimeric states are necessary for its chaperoning abilities, it will likely remain an elusive target. Proteins containing Bcl2-associated anthanogene (BAG) domains, such as BAG1 and BAG2, have been found to function as NEFs for Hsp70s [<62>]. BAG1 is upregulated in the hippocampus of AD patients [<130>], where it associates with tau and increases tau levels in cooperation with Hsp70 [<131>]. BAG1 silencing decreases tau levels, consistent with a critical role for this co-chaperone in protecting tau from degradation. However, another related BAG family member, BAG2, interacts with Hsp70 and tau but, unlike BAG1, assists clearance of phosphorylated tau [<132>]."
PMC3190966_3,"Thus, it appears that different BAG family members can have distinct and dramatic impacts on the fate of Hsp70-bound tau  Moreover, these studies suggest that pharmacologically enhancing BAG2 or inhibiting BAG1 might be expected to decrease tau levels. However, the best way to leverage this information is not yet clear. Recent work has defined Hsp110 as another NEF for Hsp70s [<133>,<134>]. This co-chaperone is of interest in tauopathies because Hsp110 knockout mice show an age-dependent accumulation of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus [<135>]. As little is known about direct binding of Hsp110 to tau or its specific effects on substrate selection by Hsp70s, it is not yet clear how these findings might be translated to therapeutics. Recently, the co-chaperone FK506-binding protein 51 kDa (FKBP51) has been implicated as a modulator of tau binding to microtubules. FKBP51 contains a PPIase domain as well as a TPR domain; thus it can be recruited to the Hsp90 system where it catalyzes isomerization of proline residues in chaperone-bound substrates. In relation to tau biology, FKBP51 enhances the association of Hsp90 with tau, co-localizes with tau in murine neurons, co-immunoprecipitates with tau in AD tissue samples and increases with age in an AD mouse model [<136>]. These interactions may be functionally important because silencing FKBP51 reduces tau and phosphorylated-tau levels [<136>]. In addition, the PPIase activity of FKBP51 was necessary for tau-related microtubule formation in a Xenopus oocyte model, suggesting that this co-chaperone is not only interacting with tau but that its enzymatic activity is important. Finally, the FKBP51–Hsp90 complex has been proposed to be responsible for the interaction of tau with phosphatases, helping to restore binding to microtubules [<137>]. Together, these studies suggest that an Hsp90–FKBP51 complex assists normal cycling of tau via multiple mechanisms. Moreover, since high-affinity inhibitors of FKBPs (e.g., FK506) are well known, these findings suggest important avenues for therapeutic intervention [<138>]. Together, these genetic and pharmacological studies suggest that targeting molecular chaperones may be a way to reduce phosphorylated tau levels and treat tauopathies. In fact, this idea has been shown for Hsp70 and Hsp90 inhibitors in model systems [<44>,<117>,<120>,<121>]. However, there are many open questions about the best way to proceed on the path to therapeutics. How do you develop drugs that reduce abnormal tau levels without impacting global proteostasis. Is it possible to selectively induce a BAG2–Hsp70 or CHIP–Hsp90 complex to accelerate tau degradation. In general, the field has a limited understanding of how normal triage decisions are made by the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone systems. How are substrates normally selected. What structural transitions lead to normal substrate turnover. What features of a substrate are important for communicating its failed folding to the chaperones. Here, we will briefly provide some plausible models that are consistent with the available findings. These discussions, while admittedly oversimplified, are intended to act as a framework for guiding future therapeutic efforts. From a medicinal chemist’s perspective, targeting the ATP-binding site of either Hsp70 or Hsp90 has significant advantages, because the nucleotide-binding pockets are deep, well-defined clefts (for a recent, in-depth review of this concept see [<68>]). Moreover, as mentioned previously, inhibitors of the ATPase activities of either Hsp70 or Hsp90 have been found to reduce tau levels, supporting the general promise of this approach [<44>,<117>,<120>,<121>]. However, the mechanisms that correlate changes in nucleotide state with substrate degradation are not clear. In general, it is thought that inhibition of ATP cycling will lead to release of the substrate to the degradation pathways because of the allostery between nucleotide state and substrate-binding affinity. However, what is the structure and composition of the early degradation complex. How does it differ from the folding or retention complex. We propose that if we better understood the molecular and structural underpinnings of this triage decision, we might be able to develop therapeutic strategies that best target abnormal tau for turnover.One potential model linking ATPase inhibitors to changes in tau fate is based on the relative partitioning of substrates onto the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperones [<139>]. As discussed earlier, both of these chaperones hydrolyze ATP and use this cycling to regulate their affinity for substrates. Thus, substrate ‘dwell time’ in the chaperone-bound state will depend, in part, on nucleotide turnover rate and the relative abundance of the ATP- and ADP-bound forms [<140>]. It seems possible that folding-competent proteins, on average, might be more transiently associated with the Hsp70–Hsp90 complex, while misfolded substrates could be ‘stalled’ and have increased dwell time. In this model, accumulation of an Hsp70–substrate complex (either via treatment with chemical inhibitors or because of intrinsic properties of the substrate) might allow enough time for a degradation factor (e.g., CHIP) to bind and facilitate polyubiquitination. This idea is supported by the findings that inhibitors of Hsp70’s ATPase activity favor degradation of tau, while activators (which would presumably promote ATP cycling) led to net retention [<73>,<117>]. Similarly, AdaSGC, which inhibits J-protein-stimulated Hsp70 ATPase activity, promotes escape of ΔF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator from ER-associated degradation [<141>]. For studies on Hsp90 inhibitors, this model also has some support. For example, Hsp90 inhibitors cause degradation of tau and many cancer-related substrates [<85>]. Moreover, these compounds were found to prolong binding of Hsp90 to a model substrate, which was sufficient to promote its degradation [<142>]. Together, these studies suggest that degradation factors, such as CHIP, might be particularly recruited to chaperones in a ‘stalled’ conformation that is enforced by prolonged ATP/ADP binding or another, yet uncharacterized, structural signal. This ‘degradation cue’ seems likely to be additionally impacted by other factors, including the context of the client, availability of co-chaperones and, possibly, the organelle environment. The fact that Hsp70 inhibitors reduce tau levels without affecting other likely Hsp70 substrates, such as α-synuclein or TDP-43, generally supports the idea that substrates are actively involved in dictating their own fate [<117>]. Direct measurements of substrate dwell times in cells will likely be required to clarify the impact of this variable on quality control decisions. The context-sensitive activity of the chaperone systems naturally gives rise to a model in which they can ‘sense’ molecular features of their substrates, such as aggregation propensity. This model is consistent with the data that hyperphosphorylated tau appears to be specifically selected for degradation by some chaperone machines, such as the Hsp90–FKBP51 complex, without effects on normal tau [<132>,<136>]. How does this selectivity arise. This question is important because any future therapy will likely need to reduce abnormal tau levels with minimal impact on total tau or global proteostasis. One potential insight comes from the observation that there are more than 40 distinct J-proteins in humans [<143>]. These co-chaperones are thought to be especially important for client selection and recruitment into the early Hsp70 triage complex. Because mammals express over forty J-proteins, dozens of NEFs, hundreds of TPRs and other co-chaperones, combinatorial assembly will quickly permit a vast array of possible Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone complexes. Thus, in this hypothetical and speculative model, groups of related substrates (e.g., hyperphosphorylated tau isoforms) might be expected to depend on a dedicated set of complexes."
PMC3190966_4,"A major prediction of this model, then, is that targeting the ‘right’ chaperone complex with small molecules might allow selective degradation of abnormal tau without adverse effects on other targets  However, this model is likely too simple. In addition to the composition of the targeted chaperone complex, cellular outcomes are likely to be influenced by the relative substrate expression levels, age, cellular-folding capacity, current flux through the degradation pathways and cell type [<144>]. Because substrate fate is thought to be dependent on a series of ‘hand-offs’ between dynamic, multiprotein chaperone complexes (as in <Figure 2>), another option for controlling the fate of tau might be to specifically target key protein–protein interactions. Consistent with this idea, data from our group and others have suggested that chemical modulators of co-chaperone interactions ‘tip’ the equilibrium and alter tau levels [<72>,<73>,<117>]. This general idea has been observed in other systems as well. For example, the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin mimics ADP binding, but also inhibits recruitment of p23, which is a necessary step in client maturation [<145>]. Interestingly, p23 deletion causes hypersensitivity to geldanamycin and its overexpression exhibits a protective effect [<146>], suggesting that these chemical and co-chaperone factors are antagonistic. Together, these data suggest that blocking recruitment of specific co-chaperones or facilitating the assembly of others might directly impact client fate. In fact, this is believed to be what occurs during natural triage steps [<147>]. For example, BAG-2 inhibits client ubiquitination by CHIP by interfering with the interaction between CHIP and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes [<148>]. In another example, McClellan et al. showed that von Hippel–Lindau tumor-suppressor protein requires Hsp70 for its folding and degradation, whereas Hsp90 is only required for degradation [<149>]. HOP was also required for degradation, indicating that transfer of von Hippel–Lindau from the Hsp70 complex to Hsp90 is a necessary part of its degradation pathway. To the medicinal chemist or chemical biologist, these studies suggest numerous potential opportunities for achieving desired outcomes by manipulating protein contacts within the chaperone system.Although there are significant challenges related to targeting protein–protein interactions, significant advances have been achieved in the past decade [<150>,<151>]. Emerging experimental methods, such as NMR-based fragment screening, are producing robust compounds [<152>] and comprehensive cheminformatics analyses have started to elucidate the features of good protein–protein interaction inhibitors [<151>]. As a result of these advances, protein–protein interaction inhibitors are being identified with increasing frequency, even in the Hsp70/Hsp90 systems [<73>,<153>]. For example, we found that dihydropyrimidine-based molecules can either force the association of a prokaryotic Hsp70 with its J-protein partner or, with a relatively modest change in chemical structure, related compounds could block this contact [<73>]. Using high-throughput screening against the J-protein-stimulated ATPase activity of an Hsp70, we also found polyphenols that selectively block J-stimulated activities by interfering with J-protein recruitment to the Hsp70 complex [<72>]. We termed this approach ‘gray box’ screening because it uses reconstituted, multichaperone complexes to uncover chemical inhibitors that target context-specific allosteric sites [<65>]. Together, these early studies suggest that the chaperone complexes might be amenable to chemical prodding, perhaps altering the fate of substrates, such as tau, that pass through this quality control system. Over the past decade, induction of Hsps has been shown to ameliorate proteotoxicity caused by misfolded proteins [<154>–<159>]. Accordingly, pharmacological activation of the heat shock response may be another viable strategy for the treatment of tauopathies. Towards that eventual goal, several compounds that activate HSF1 have been reported (reviewed in [<160>]). However, the mechanisms that link HSF1 induction to improved proteostasis are not yet clear. In the case of HSF1 inducers, it seems plausible that the resulting conditions (e.g., elevated levels of Hsp70/90) influence the average dwell time of misfolded substrates on chaperones, leading to improved capacity to degrade damaged proteins. In addition, high concentrations of chaperones, including Hsp27, might protect misfolded proteins from engaging in off-pathway, proteotoxic interactions. Because N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors often induce a stress response, this mechanism may be particularly important in the response of abnormal tau to those compounds. What does the future hold for molecular chaperones as therapeutic targets for tauopathies. As emphasized throughout these discussions, we expect that more detailed insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of protein quality control will allow us to safely promote the turnover of abnormal tau. Based on our current knowledge, it seems likely that these eventual therapies will include compounds targeting the ATP-binding clefts of Hsp70/90. These compounds might prolong the dwell time of abnormal tau on the chaperones, promoting their degradation. However, to achieve low toxicity, this list of possible drugs may also include molecules that target other regions on Hsp70 and Hsp90, especially co-chaperone binding surfaces that influence the selection of substrates. Finally, other chaperones, such as small Hsps, remain underexplored as drug targets because they lack obvious binding sites. Finding ways to target these factors, directly or via induction of a heat shock response, may expand our ability to accelerate tau turnover and ameliorate tauopathies.Even with these expected advances in medicinal chemistry and compound discovery, a number of other challenges await their clinical deployment. For example, conducting trials in patients with aging-related neurodegenerative disorders is a daunting task. In the next decade, we expect that trials in this area will become more sophisticated, favoring more adaptive designs. Of equal importance, biomarkers that distinguish between different dementias, including tauopathies, will need to become better defined. Although these problems are not specific to tauopathies, they will need to be solved to encourage investment in this area.Thus, in the next 10 years, we expect that new generations of chaperone inhibitors will emerge. These compounds will target many different aspects of chaperone biology and their discoveries will coincide with a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of protein quality control. Together with improved clinical trial design and better biomarkers, we expect that these advancements will significantly accelerate development of novel treatments for tauopathies. rhetorical Figure 1 Hsp: Heat shock protein. rhetorical Figure 2 Unfolded or misfolded substrates enter the chaperone cycle by engaging in interactions with J-proteins, which recruit Hsp70 family chaperones.

PMC3190966_5,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that accumulates in at least 15 different neurodegenerative disorders, which are collectively referred to as tauopathies  In these diseases, tau is often hyperphosphorylated and found in aggregates, including paired helical filaments, neurofibrillary tangles and other abnormal oligomers. Tau aggregates are associated with neuron loss and cognitive decline, which suggests that this protein can somehow evade normal quality control allowing it to aberrantly accumulate and become proteotoxic. Consistent with this idea, recent studies have shown that molecular chaperones, such as heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90, counteract tau accumulation and neurodegeneration in disease models. These molecular chaperones are major components of the protein quality control systems and they are specifically involved in the decision to retain or degrade many proteins, including tau and its modified variants. Thus, one potential way to treat tauopathies might be to either accelerate interactions of abnormal tau with these quality control factors or tip the balance of triage towards tau degradation. In this review, we summarize recent findings and suggest models for therapeutic intervention. ."
PMC5147514_0,"It is well-established that inflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD). Inflammation and synapse loss occur in disease prior to the formation of larger aggregates, but the contribution of tau to inflammation has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Tau pathologically aggregates to form large fibrillar structures known as tangles. However, evidence suggests that smaller soluble aggregates, called oligomers, are the most toxic species and form prior to tangles. Furthermore, tau oligomers can spread to neighboring cells and between anatomically connected brain regions. In addition, recent evidence suggests that inspecting the retina may be a window to brain pathology. We hypothesized that there is a relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation, which are hallmarks of early disease. We conducted immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses on tauopathy mice, FTLD, and AD subjects. We showed that oligomers co-localize with astrocytes, microglia, and HMGB1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Additionally, we show that tau oligomers are present in the retina and are associated with inflammatory cells suggesting that the retina may be a valid non-invasive biomarker for brain pathology. These results suggest that there may be a toxic relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation. Therefore, the ability of tau oligomers to spread may initiate a feed-forward cycle in which tau oligomers induce inflammation, leading to neuronal damage, and thus more inflammation. Further mechanistic studies are warranted in order to understand this relationship, which may have critical implications for improving the treatment of tauopathies.

We thank the Kayed lab members for their support and suggestions in preparing the manuscript. Authors’ disclosures available online ( http://j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/16-0912 ). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ), and the altered processing of the protein tau, are associated with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death that leads to cognitive and behavioral deficits. It is becoming increasingly apparent that another prominent feature of AD brains is inflammation, which has a significant influence on disease progression [<1>]. The majority of transgenic mouse models of AD exhibit substantial reactive gliosis with the accumulation of activated astrocytes and microglia in affected brain regions, often prior to the appearance of plaque and tangle pathology [<2>]. The severity of inflammation in many of these animals correlates with neuronal death [<2>], and moreover, the local inflammatory environment directly influences the rate of disease progression and the extent of neuronal loss [<3>]. Recent data shows that astrocyte-mediated inflammatory responses play a significant role in mediating neurotoxic responses to Aβ [<4>]. Importantly, these results suggest that disrupting inflammatory signaling, in combination with other therapies such as anti-oligomer therapies, could provide a novel neuroprotective intervention for AD and related diseases.The pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, culminates in large insoluble aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and other inclusions containing hyperphosphorylated tau. These aggregates are the defining histopathological features of AD and other tauopathies, including frontotemporal lobar dementia with tau (FTLD-tau), Pick’s disease, and corticobasal degeneration [<5>]. FTLD encompasses a broad spectrum of distinct pathologies and protein aggregations that manifest with similar symptoms, ranging from primary tauopathy to transactive response DNA/RNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) or Fus positive inclusions [<6, 7>]. In FTLD-TDP there are TDP-43 positive, α-synuclein negative, and tau negative inclusions. They typically do not have extensive tangle pathology [<8>], but little to no research has been conducted on smaller tau oligomers in FTLD-TDP which we have investigated here. Recent research has shown that the NFTs themselves are not the most toxic form of tau, but rather the smaller aggregates called tau oligomers likely initiate neurodegeneration in tauopathies [<9–23>].Inspection of the retina has been suggested as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegeneration [<24–26>]. There is a higher incidence of age-related macular degeneration in patients with AD [<27>]. While the link remains unclear between retinal degeneration and neurodegeneration, there is increasing evidence that they may be linked. Tau oligomers were recently found in the retina of a rat model for glaucoma and suppression of tau reduced the occurrence of retinal degeneration [<28>]. Also, there is evidence of large protein deposits, such as Aβ and tau, being present in the retina of AD patients and in tauopathy mice as well as the presence of inflammation [<24–26, 29, 30>]. Early detection of AD, possibly even prodromal detection, would allow for the early intervention and prevention of neurodegeneration prior to major synapse loss and cognitive decline. Using the retina for the detection of both retinal damage and AD would also be non-invasive, inexpensive, and could be translated into the clinic as part of a normal screening done at patientcheckups.Inflammation is a critical marker of neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to protein aggregates. Inflammation and cell death occur prior to, or independently, from the formation of NFTs in AD and in transgenic mouse models [<9, 12, 13, 15, 31>]. Therefore, it is likely that tau oligomers, which form prior to NFTs, may be causing the inflammation [<23>]. This inflammatory response may induce a self-perpetuating cycle, whereby tau oligomers increase inflammation, causing more damage to the neurons, which in turn may increase the rate of oligomer formation. Furthermore, a majority of transgenic mouse models of AD exhibit astrogliosis and microgliosis in affected brain regions, often prior to the appearance of plaque and tangle pathology [<2>]. The severity of inflammation in many of these animals correlates with neuronal death [<2>]. Moreover, the local inflammatory environment directly influences the rate of disease progression and the extent of neuronal loss [<3, 32>], suggesting that disrupting inflammatory signaling, in addition to removing tau oligomers, could provide a novel neuroprotective intervention for neurodegenerative diseases.Neuroinflammation is often thought to be a response induced by Aβ in AD [<3, 32>], given this, there are few reports investigating the role of tau oligomers in neuroinflammation. The studies that have investigated tau indicate tau may play a role in neuroinflammation and may be an early contributor to neurodegeneration [<33, 34>]. These results warrant further investigation. Thus, we used tauopathy mice and postmortem FTLD-TDP, and AD brain samples to study tau oligomers and inflammation. The tauopathy mice that we used contained the P301L mutation, which is implicated in some genetic tauopathies. In addition, this mutation, along with the related P301S mutation, has been associated with increased inflammation in the brain as well as retinal deficits [<24, 33>]. However, these events were investigated in isolation and were not investigated thoroughly to determine if they are linked. Also, FTLD-TDP samples were used because they do not have Aβ plaques or tau tangles, thus removing these conditions as potential confounding factors for inflammation. Additionally, tau oligomers have never been examined in FTLD-TDP and may play a role in the late stages of the disease. Thus, we used this model to determine the role tau oligomers play in inflammation in the absence of Aβ and NFTs. We hypothesized that tau oligomers play a role in the feed forward cycle of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative tauopathies."
PMC5147514_1,"We performed systematic immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses of brain tissue from transgenic tau mice and FTLD patients  Analyses were performed using a tau oligomer-specific antibody in combination with antibodies for inflammatory markers, including astrocytes and microglia. Our data shows that tau oligomers are associated with markers for neuroinflammation suggesting that tau oligomers may play a role in a feed forward mechanisms resulting in chronic neuroinflammation. These descriptive results call attention to the important and novel role tau oligomers may play in inflammation and in accelerating neurodegeneration. Furthermore, these results validate the potential of the retina to be used as biomarker of neurodegeneration. This study demonstrates a need to identify and characterize the relationship and mechanism behind the association of tau oligomers and inflammation. Perhaps, disrupting this association through anti-oligomer and anti-inflammatory combination therapies can slow the progression, or even halt, neurodegenerative tauopathies. Animals were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Animals were euthanized with CO2 and perfused transcardially with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brains and eyes were collected and snap frozen. They were stored at –80°C. The right eye and hemisphere were homogenized, while the left hemisphere and eye were sectioned. Briefly, frozen tissues were diced and homogenized in PBS with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.02% NaN3 using a 1:3 mass: volume dilution ratio. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were divided into aliquots, snap-frozen, and stored at –80°C until use. Postmortem human brain tissues were homogenized by the same protocol. Human samples were obtained from the Oregon Brain Bank and were collected by that institution following approved protocols and laws regarding human tissue. Immunofluorescent labeling was conducted on frozen cortical brain sections of Htau (Jackson Laboratory, stock #004808, n = 3), and wildtype (WT) (Taconic, BALB/c, n = 2) mice as well as brain samples from FTLD (n = 4), AD (n = 4), and age-matched controls (n = 4) (Oregon Brain Bank). P301L (Taconic, stock #2508, n = 3) mouse eye sections were also used. Immunofluorescence was conducted as previously published [<35>]. Briefly, the sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and the human sections were treated with an autofluorescence eliminator as per manufacturer instructions (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Mouse and human sections were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and were then incubated with tau oligomer-specific polycolonal antibody T22 (mouse-1:250, human-1:200, [<22>]) in 4°C overnight. The following day, the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 1 h. Sections were then incubated overnight with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (mouse and human-1:150, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), Iba1 (mouse and human- 1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or high motility group box 1 (HMGB1) (Mouse-1:50, Abcam, human-1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C. The sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen) or goat anti-rabbit 568 for 1 h. The sections were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). The retinal slides were imaged with a confocal LSM510 Zeiss laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) as a single digital image. The brain sections were imaged on a Nikon A1R MP laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 60X magnification under oil submersion. The objective numerical aperture was 1.4. Using ImageJ, the corrected cell fluorescence method was used to quantify the images as previously described [<35, 36>]. Briefly, there were four separate images from each section analyzed using this method where five cells were measured as well as five background regions. In order to account for cell size and background, the background was multiplied by the area of the cell and subtracted from the total fluorescence. One-way ANOVA, student’s t-tests, or Pearson’s correlation were used to analyze the corrected cell fluorescence on Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA). In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was measured to quantify the strength of co-localization between T22 and GFAP using ImageJ software. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to detect the astrocyte marker, GFAP, and total tau. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Plates were coated with 30 μg/well using 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, as coating buffer, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. Age-matched control (n = 4), FTLD (n = 4), and AD (n = 4) brains obtained from the Oregon Brain bank, were used in the ELISA. Negative and positive controls were conducted. The positive control was Tg2576 insoluble brain homogenate with 0.05% Triton-X in PBS. Plates were washed 1 time with Tris-buffered saline with low Tween (0.01%) (TBST), then blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The plates were then washed with TBST 1 time. Anti-GFAP (1:2000, Covance, Princeton, NJ) was diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST and added to one plate. Anti-Tau5 (1:1000, Millipore), diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST, was added to another plate and all were allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed 3 times with TBST and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3000, BioRad, Hercules, CA) was added. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, plates were washed 3 times with TBST and developed with 3,3’,5,5’,-tetramethylbenzidine substrate from DAKO (Carpentaria, CA). The reaction was stopped with 100 μl 1 M HCl, and samples were read at 450 nm using a POLARstar OMEGA plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Ortenberg, Germany). One-way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was used to analyze results on GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Images were quantified using corrected cell fluorescence, as described previously [<35, 36>]. Four images per subject were obtained and five cells were outlined and measured in each image. To account for both background and the size of the cell, five background measurements were also taken and the background fluorescence was multiplied by the area. This was subtracted from the total intensity for the cell in order to obtain a corrected cell fluorescence. The corrected cell fluorescence for five cells per image were averaged and a One-Way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was conducted to compare control (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), FTLD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), and AD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified). A student’s unpaired t-test was used for the mouse quantifications with two groups while a One-Way ANOVA was used for the mouse samples with more than two groups. For the ELISA, One-Way ANOVA was used with multiple comparisons test. All statistics were performed on GraphPad Prism6 (GraphPad Software) and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Tau abnormalities in the retina of transgenic animals have been investigated extensively, but the association of tau oligomers with inflammation remains unknown. We investigated the co-localization of tau oligomers with inflammatory markers in the retina of an aggressive tauopathy mouse model, P301L. T22 is a novel conformational polyclonal antibody developed by our laboratory. It recognizes tau oligomers but does not recognize tau monomers or fibrils [<22, 37>]. We discovered the presence of activated astrocytes in the retina, associated with oligomeric tau aggregates. We also found that tau oligomers are present in the outer nuclear layer of the eye, localized in close proximity to activated astrocyte processes in the outer plexiform layer (<Fig. 1>)."
PMC5147514_2,"In order to further characterize the pattern of inflammation and tau oligomer pathology in the eye of transgenic tau mice, we investigated the presence of activated microglia and tau oligomers in the rod outer segment (ROS) of the eye  Labeling the P301L mouse retina with T22, Iba1, and DAPI revealed microglial cells co-localizing with tau oligomers in the ROS (<Fig. 1>). There was also evidence of hyper-activation and proliferation of microglial cells at the ROS and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layers. Activation of microglia was seen throughout the retina of P301L transgenic mice. Of note, are small cell bodies with irregular, short, cell processes that are present near the deposits of T22 positive tau oligomers. Co-localization of the microglia with tau oligomers may indicate the engulfment of the oligomers by the activated microglia. Additionally, we detected glial cell processes of Muller cells extending to the outer nuclear cells, co-localizing with mutant tau oligomers, and concurring with the phagocytic nature of the Muller cells in a pathological event (<Fig. 1>). Both thick and thin ramifications of the Muller cell processes were noted throughout the outer nuclear layer, as well as in close apposition to the outer limiting membrane. Also noted were multiple small cell bodies of Muller cells in the inner nuclear layer, with some dendritic spurs towards the ganglion cell layers. These findings help support the idea that eyes can be used as a means to study some of the pathological changes in the central nervous system. Frozen frontal cortical brain sections from FTLD, AD, and age-matched controls were analyzed with immunofluorescent staining. We found that tau oligomers were surrounded by the astrocyte marker, GFAP. Additionally, there was a significant increase in GFAP protein levels as compared to the control (<Fig. 2>). It is important to note that GFAP did not appear to co-localize with tau oligomers directly, yet GFAP was in close proximity suggesting that tau oligomers are interacting with astrocytes but not engulfing the tau oligomers. The astrocytes appear to be surrounding the tau oligomer containing cells but not fully internalizing the tau oligomers (<Fig. 2F, I>). To more accurately quantify GFAP protein levels and total tau protein, we conducted a direct ELISA. We found that in FTLD and AD, astrocyte levels were significantly higher than in the age-matched controls (<Fig. 2J>). However, total tau was not significantly different between age-matched controls, FTLD, and AD suggesting a gain of function toxicity for the tau oligomers rather than increased toxicity due to the upregulation of tau protein.In order to confirm and further validate the association between astrocytes and tau oligomers we used the Htau mouse model. The Htau mouse model was used here because it expresses all six human tau isoforms without expressing mouse tau making it a better model for sporadic tauopathy. In addition, Htau mice have been shown to have neuroinflammation previously allowing us to investigate if this inflammation can be linked to tau oligomers [<34>]. Using immunofluorescence of cortical regions with GFAP and T22 tau oligomer-specific antibodies, we found that the number of astrocytes in Htau mice changes with age and in comparison to WT mice (<Fig. 3>). Seven-month-old WT mice exhibited low levels of reactive astrocytes and negligible tau oligomer staining. We showed that at 3 months of age, Htau mice have only limited astrocyte activation, but by 11 months, Htau mice begin to show evidence of fragmented astrocytes, as well as some reactive morphology. Astrocyte activation is dramatically increased when tau oligomers are present at higher levels in the brains of 24-month-old Htau mice. GFAP corrected cell fluorescence was significantly increased in the brains of Htau mice, increasing with the age of the mice as well as in comparison to the WT mice. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between GFAP and T22 corrected cell fluorescence regardless of age or genotype (r = 0.662, r2 = 0.439, p < 0.01). These data suggest a possible interaction between tau oligomers and reactive astrocytes in inflammation.The FTLD, AD, and control subject frontal cortical sections were stained for tau oligomers and microglia. Tau oligomers co-localized with microglia in FTLD and AD subjects, suggesting that tau oligomers may play a role in stimulating inflammation (<Fig. 4>). In contrast to the astrocytes, co-localization suggests internalization of the tau oligomers. Microglial quantification by corrected cell fluorescence also showed a significant increase in Iba1 in FTLD and AD, which is common in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Next, we examined the relationship of microglia and tau oligomers in Htau cortices. We used Iba1 and T22 to immunolabel brains from WT and Htau mice. We found little evidence of microglial activation in WT mice and negligible labeling for tau oligomers, as expected for a WT animal. However, in Htau mice at 24 months of age, a significant increase in activated microglia was detected, largely co-localizing with tau oligomers (<Fig. 5>). This was consistent with the results seen in the human cases and indicates a potential interplay between toxic oligomeric tau and microglia. In addition, this co-localization could indicate that tau oligomers are being internalized by the microglia, which may increase the spread of pathology [<38>].To further characterize inflammation, we investigated the association of tau oligomers with the chromatin protein, high motility group box 1 (HMGB1). HMGB1 is a protein normally found within the nucleus of cells that are not undergoing inflammatory processes. During inflammation, however, HMGB1 can translocate from the nucleus to the cytosol and can then be secreted as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We conducted T22 and HMGB1 immunofluorescence on tissues from the frontal cortex of FTLD, AD, and age-matched controls. HMGB1 localized to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus, as was seen in the control subjects indicating inflammatory signaling in the FTLD and AD subjects (<Fig. 6>). HMGB1 showed significantly increased corrected cell fluorescence in FTLD and AD samples compared to controls. The increase in HMGB1 and its translocation to the cytoplasm indicate it has been activated as a pro-inflammatory signal in FTLD and AD brains. The co-localization of tau oligomers with HMGB1 suggests there may be an interaction between tau oligomers and inflammatory signaling. To further characterize the relationship of HMGB1 and tau oligomers in the cortex we conducted immunofluorescence in WT and Htau mice. We found that HMGB1 was detected at low levels that were, primarily, associated with the nucleus in WT mice (<Fig. 7>). HMGB1 was transported out of the nuclei in 24-month-old Htau mice, a condition that was representative of the activation of HMGB1 as an inflammatory cytokine. These results were consistent with those seen in the brains of human subjects. However, tau oligomers co-localized with HMGB1 to a much lesser extent in mice as compared to the human samples, suggesting the relationship between tau oligomers and the pro-inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 may be different between species or that the relationship is more complex. These results warrant further research to determine more specifically the mechanisms in human subjects. A growing body of evidence suggests that large meta-stable tau aggregates, including NFTs, are not causally linked to tauopathy phenotypes and appear after neuronal toxicity [<9–23>], suggesting that soluble tau oligomers may underlie early disease stages. We recently demonstrated that tau oligomers form prior to NFTs, are present intra- and extracellularly, are highly toxic, induce cognitive deficits in vivo, and play a crucial role in neuronal cytopathology [<11, 22, 39, 40>]. We also established the specificity and efficacy of one tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conformationally distinct subset of tau oligomers in the same tauopathy animal models used in the present study: aged P301L mice [<41, 42>] and Htau mice [<43, 44>]."
PMC5147514_3,"Furthermore, we published evidence that tau oligomer transformation into pore-like structures is cell-specific and disease-specific [<45>]  In addition we were able to isolate, characterize, and propagate tau oligomers from postmortem brain tissue of patients with various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as, patients with traumatic brain injury [<35, 36, 44>].Our results demonstrate that tau oligomers may induce inflammation in FTLD, AD, and potentially, other neurodegenerative diseases, thus linking tau oligomer deposition to inflammatory signaling in the brain. It is interesting that our results suggest that astrocytes interact with tau oligomers but do not appear to engulf them, while microglia showed extensive co-localization. This is consistent with data in current literature that indicates that microglia can engulf tau oligomers and secrete them in exosomes, facilitating their propagation to surrounding cells [<38>]. Tau oligomers and inflammation may be self-reinforcing stimuli leading to chronic inflammation, physiological impairments, cellular dysfunction, and ultimately, neurodegeneration. Additionally, the spread of tau oligomers from one brain region to another [<37, 46, 47>] may initiate inflammation, inducing a toxic cycle of tau oligomers, inflammation, and cell death in larger anatomical areas (<Fig. 8>). This suggests that the propagation of tau oligomers may also propagate inflammation and increase the rate of degeneration. Future studies characterizing the inflammation phenotypes specific to tau oligomers in FTLD, AD, and other neurodegenerative diseases should elucidate the mechanism and confirm that tau oligomers are inducing the inflammation. Our results are novel in that they associate tau oligomers specifically with inflammation, a process that occurs early in disease pathogenesis, and they lay the foundation for future studies to explore this relationship. Further studies should be done to investigate whether inflammation can induce oligomer production, which would contribute to this vicious cycle. Our results confirm inflammation as a contributing factor to the neurodegenerative disease cascade, and they have implications for therapeutic approaches [<32>].Moreover, the findings reported here, and by other investigators, regarding retinal damage in tau transgenic mice provide a basis for the under-reported visual deficits in these animals [<30>]. These data also provide evidence that detecting neurodegeneration may be possible by detecting retinal damage. Development of non-invasive techniques to detect early neurodegeneration is essential for the advancement of therapies. Our descriptive data shown here call for the characterization of eye pathology in neurodegenerative diseases such as FTLD and AD in order to determine how the retina changes throughout disease progression. Perhaps, non-invasive eye examinations could be used as a diagnostic for the detection of these diseases.Another exciting result from our research is the discovery of the association between tau oligomers and HMGB1, which is an important mediator for inflammation in the brain, as well as peripherally. HMGB1 has been well-established as a pro-inflammatory cytokine when it is released into the extracellular space and is produced by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia [<48–50>]. In addition, astrocytes and microglia can respond to HMGB1 by producing pro-inflammatory conditions, which is suggested to play an important role in neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases [<51–53>]. HMGB1 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, but it has also been implicated in a necrotic cell death response [<54, 55>]. Following acute injuries, such as ischemic brain insults, HMGB1 is translocated out of the nucleus and appears to play a role in necrosis or necroptosis (programed cell death in response to injury) [<55>]. However, it is unlikely that the HMGB1 response seen here is necrosis related due to that fact that neurodegeneration is a process lasting many years to many decades. Rather, it is much more likely that the HMGB1 translocation out of the nucleus is stimulating the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to the chronic state of inflammation that is a known characteristic of most neurodegenerative diseases.One of several possible pathways by which HMGB1 may be acting as a pro-inflammatory cytokine is through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is a multi-ligand receptor that binds HMGB1, Aβ, and advanced glycation end products [<56>]. It is possible that RAGE may also bind tau oligomers and initiate pro-inflammatory signaling through the RAS, p38, and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) pathway [<56>]. The NFκB transcription factor increases the expression of HMGB1 and its receptor RAGE, increasing pro-inflammatory RAGE signaling by a feed-forward mechanism [<57, 58>]. HMGB1 is well established as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which can induce the production of other cytokines through the NFκB pathway [<59>]. <Figure 8> illustrates a hypothetical model for these interactions. Tau oligomers may interact with astrocytes and microglia to induce inflammation, potentially through RAGE signaling. This inflammation, in turn, damages neurons resulting in more inflammation. In addition, signaling via the RAGE receptor on the surface of neurons can activate p38, which is known to phosphorylate tau, and may increase the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau. Hyperphosphorylated tau is more prone to aggregate, leading to the production of more oligomers that can produce their own toxicity and induce further inflammation. Our results implicate HMGB1 as a possible key player in tau-induced inflammation and toxicity, and therefore, further investigation of its role in tauopathies and brain injuries are warranted. Thus, the association of tau oligomers with cells producing and secreting HMGB1 could have important implications for inflammation associated with tauopathies.Finally, the existence of tau oligomers in FTLD-TDP is a novel finding since FTLD-TDP is associated with TDP-43 inclusions rather than tau inclusions. These results may be relevant to disease progression, and it would be interesting to investigate the temporal appearance of tau oligomers and disease progression. It is likely that the appearance of tau oligomers is a late occurrence in FTLD-TDP due to the lack of larger insoluble aggregates of tau in this disease. However, it is also possible that the oligomers are more stable in FTLD-TDP, thus prolonging their toxic longevity and inhibiting the formation of the less-toxic fibrils. The specificity of the T22 antibody has been established in previous studies. We found that it reliably and specifically detects tau oligomers[<22, 35–37, 39>].In summary, our results demonstrate increased deposition of tau oligomers and neuroinflammation in the retina and brain tissue from tauopathy mice and from patients with FTLD-TDP and AD. The tau oligomer pathology and inflammation in the animal models showed a clear association. Furthermore, there is promise in the development of non-invasive eye examinations for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, these results can be translated into FTLD and AD, and they indicate that tau oligomers are associated with inflammation. The descriptive results shown here demonstrate a novel association between tau oligomers and inflammation. However, the mechanism and pathways that associate tau oligomers and inflammation need to be elucidated, and this should be a priority for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration researchers. Moreover, these results suggests that the degeneration of neurons due to chronic inflammation induced by tau oligomers may be inhibited through the combination of anti-tau oligomer and anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies. This combination would inhibit the proposed feed forward cycle shown in <Fig. 8> from two different angles, tau oligomers and inflammatory signaling. rhetorical Fig."

Scale bar 20 μm. rhetorical Fig.8 A hypothetical model of the toxic relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation. A) Tau oligomers can spread from brain region to brain region, potentially triggering inflammation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by interacting with astrocytes and microglia. The inflammation may become chronic, resulting in further damage to the neurons and in turn, increased inflammation and eventual cell death. B) RAGE, a potential receptor for tau oligomers, signals NFκB through several pathways including through RAS and p38. This increases the production of both RAGE and its ligand, HMGB1, initiating a feed-forward mechanism producing a state of chronic inflammation. Additionally, p38 is known to phosphorylate tau and may increase the abundance of hyperphosphorylated tau, which is more prone to aggregate into oligomers. This may, in turn, induce more inflammation through the production of more oligomers."
PMC5147514_5,"It is well-established that inflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD)  Inflammation and synapse loss occur in disease prior to the formation of larger aggregates, but the contribution of tau to inflammation has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Tau pathologically aggregates to form large fibrillar structures known as tangles. However, evidence suggests that smaller soluble aggregates, called oligomers, are the most toxic species and form prior to tangles. Furthermore, tau oligomers can spread to neighboring cells and between anatomically connected brain regions. In addition, recent evidence suggests that inspecting the retina may be a window to brain pathology. We hypothesized that there is a relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation, which are hallmarks of early disease. We conducted immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses on tauopathy mice, FTLD, and AD subjects. We showed that oligomers co-localize with astrocytes, microglia, and HMGB1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Additionally, we show that tau oligomers are present in the retina and are associated with inflammatory cells suggesting that the retina may be a valid non-invasive biomarker for brain pathology. These results suggest that there may be a toxic relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation. Therefore, the ability of tau oligomers to spread may initiate a feed-forward cycle in which tau oligomers induce inflammation, leading to neuronal damage, and thus more inflammation. Further mechanistic studies are warranted in order to understand this relationship, which may have critical implications for improving the treatment of tauopathies. ."
PMC4548441_0,"Clinical evidence has implicated diabetes mellitus as one of the risk factors for the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the neurotoxic pathway activated due to abnormalities in glucose metabolism has not yet been identified in AD. In order to investigate the relationship between impaired cerebral glucose metabolism and the pathophysiology of AD, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were exposed to glyceraldehyde (GA), an inhibitor of glycolysis. GA induced the production of GA-derived advanced glycation end-products (GA-AGEs) and cell apoptosis, glycolytic inhibition, decreases in the medium concentrations of diagnostic markers of AD, such as amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ42), and increases in tau phosphorylation. These results suggest that the production of GA-AGEs and/or inhibition of glycolysis induce AD-like alterations, and this model may be useful for examining the pathophysiology of AD. This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 22300264 & 25282029. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the presence of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the major constituents of which are the amyloid β protein (Aβ) and tau protein<1>. The accumulation of Aβ is considered to be one of the early and causative events in the pathogenesis of AD and markedly increases during progression of the disease, leading to the generation of NFTs and, ultimately, neuronal cell death<2>. AD is a worldwide health problem with implications for an increasing number of people and countries. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of AD is important for delaying the degenerative process and dementia. Reactive derivatives from non-enzymatic sugar-protein condensation reactions, as well as lipids and nucleic acids exposed to reducing sugars including glucose, form a heterogeneous group of irreversible adducts called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)<3>. The formation and subsequent accumulation of AGEs in various tissues are known to progress during normal aging, and at a markedly faster rate in diabetes mellitus (DM)<4><5>. Numerous epidemiological studies have indicated that a relationship exists between DM and AD, with the incidence of AD being up to 2–5-fold higher in patients with DM<6>. A previous study detected AGEs, which were identified immunohistochemically, in SPs and NFTs from patients with AD<7>. Furthermore, we demonstrated that glyceraldehyde (GA)-derived AGEs (GA-AGEs), one of the representative ligands for the receptor of AGEs (RAGE), but not other sugar-derived AGEs, exerted toxic effects on cultured neuronal cells<8>. The neurotoxic effects of DM serum were completely canceled by neutralizing antibodies against GA-AGEs<8>. Therefore, we hypothesized that AGEs, especially GA-AGEs, are one of the missing links between AD and DM.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests have been proposed for the early detection of AD<9>. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that CSF findings in DM patients are an indicator AD. Aβ42 and total and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tauT181) in the CSF are useful markers for the diagnosis of AD, in which Aβ42 concentrations are lower while the tau protein and its phosphorylated form are higher than those in healthy subjects<10><11>. A previous study showed that the intracellular phosphorylation of tau was increased in the cortex of AD patients<12>. The CSF levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were found to be significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls<13>. However, limited information is available for the mechanisms underlying CSF and intracellular molecular changes. Although recent findings suggest that cerebral glucose metabolism is impaired from the early stage of AD<14><15>, it currently remains unclear whether reductions in the utilization of glucose lead to the development of AD.In the present study, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with GA, an inhibitor of glycolysis<16><17>, and examinations of cell viability and measurements of the concentrations of Aβ42, total tau, and p-tauT181 proteins in culture media as well as the phosphorylation ratio of intracellular tau were then performed in order to determine the involvement of glucose metabolism in the pathophysiology of AD. A microscopic analysis revealed that GA clearly exerted cytotoxic effects on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells at 0–1 mM (<Fig. 1a–d>). The WST-8 assay showed that the viability of cells was significantly reduced from 0.7 mM (<Fig. 1e>). Fluorescent microscopic analyses revealed that cells exhibited green fluorescence with YO-PRO®-1 dye, which detected early apoptosis in a GA-dose dependent manner (<Fig. 1f–i>). On the other hand, the red fluorescence of propidium iodide for necrosis was not observed (data not shown), suggesting that GA-induced cell death was mainly caused by apoptosis. A relationship has recently been reported between the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and apoptotic events<14>. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed that the expression of GAPDH was significantly increased by the addition of GA (<Fig. 2a>). These results suggested that GA caused cell toxicity concomitant with increases in the gene expression of GAPDH in SH-SY5Y cells. We then measured GA-AGE levels after the 24-h treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with GA using slot blots. A small band of GA-AGEs was observed in the vehicle control (<Fig. 2b>). GA dose-dependently increased the production of GA-AGEs in SH-SY5Y cells. The reductions observed in cell viability following a 24 h incubation with GA were significantly restored by the addition of 1 mM (P < 0.05) or 10 mM (P < 0.01) acetoacetate (ACAC), a substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<Fig. 2d>), whereas lactic acid concentrations were not (<Fig. 2c>). Glucose consumption, calculated by differences in medium concentrations during the incubation, negatively correlated with lactic acid concentrations (data not shown). These results suggested that GA inhibited glycolysis while ACAC restored cell viability without recovering reductions in glycolysis. In order to determine the effects of GA on CSF markers for the development of AD, an aliquot of medium was analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 24 h after the addition of GA. Aβ42 in the medium decreased in a GA dose-dependent manner (<Fig. 3a>). In contrast, GA significantly increased tau and its phosphorylated form, p-tauT181 (<Fig. 3b,c>) in the medium. The ratio of the phosphorylation of intracellular tau was increased significantly at 0.7 mM (P < 0.05) and 1 mM (P < 0.01) GA (<Fig. 3d>). In addition, VEGF (<Fig. 3e>) and TGF-β (<Fig. 3f>), which are also AD biomarkers, were increased when the concentration of GA added was greater than 0.7 mM. The present study has three salient results: 1) GA induced the formation of GA-AGEs and exhibited cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. 2) The mechanism underlying GA-induced cell death involved the inhibition of glycolysis and concomitant induction of GAPDH. 3) Changes in the levels of AD biomarkers in GA-treated culture media were consistent with those in the CSF of AD patients.Epidemiological studies recently reported that the risk of developing AD was higher in DM patients than in the general population<18>. The Rotterdam study, which surveyed more than 6,300 patients, indicated a relationship between DM and AD with a relative risk (RR) of 1.9<19>. Given the recent interest in the relationship between insulin and AD, patients in that study receiving exogenous insulin therapy were at the highest risk (RR 4.3) of developing dementia<20><21>. On the other hand, the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, which explored a cohort of 2,574 patients, also indicated that the risk of developing AD was 1.8 in DM patients while that of vascular dementia was 2.3<22>. Since AGE levels were previously shown to be upregulated in the brains of diabetic patients with AD<23>, these findings may partly explain the clinical link between DM and AD."
PMC4548441_1,"The involvement of AGEs in AD has been suggested in several studies published successively between 1994 and 1995<24><25><26>  SPs were previously shown to be positively stained by an anti-serum against glucose-derived AGEs (Glu-AGEs)<7>. Münch’s group also reported that Glu-AGEs had similar effects to those of Aβ, namely, increases in neurotoxicity and glucose consumption in a SH-SY5Y cell culture system<27><28><29>. In our previous studies<30><31>, we demonstrated that α-hydroxyaldehydes (glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde) and dicarbonyl compounds (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone) contributed to the glycation of proteins. We confirmed that GA-AGEs and glycolaldehyde-derived AGEs (Glycol-AGEs) were strongly neurotoxic in a neuronal culture system<1><8>. The neurotoxicities of these AGE species were stronger than those of Glu-AGEs and N-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), two extensively examined AGE species. Moreover, the neurotoxic effects of serum AGEs from diabetic patients on hemodialysis were completely attenuated by the addition of an anti-GA-AGE-specific antibody, but not the antibodies of glycolaldehyde-, methylglyoxal-, glyoxal-, 3-deoxyglucosone-, or glucose-derived AGEs<1><8>. Therefore, GA-AGEs are powerful candidate molecules for neurodegeneration in AD, and, consequently, we focused on the mechanism underlying GA-AGE-induced neurotoxicity in the present study.On the other hand, a Glu-AGE antibody was shown to react with SPs, mainly with the amyloid core, whereas GA-AGE and Glycol-AGE antibodies showed no immunoreactivity with SPs<32>. These findings suggested that Aβ was glycated by glucose, rather than GA. GA-AGEs are mainly present in the neurons of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. It was mainly localized in the perikarya of neurons and staining pattern was uniform, differing from the dot-like pattern of Glu-AGE staining<32>. Furthermore, Glu-AGEs were detected in intracellular and extracellular sites, whereas GA-AGEs were only found intracellularly. This discrepancy indicated that the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity induced by Glu-AGEs and GA-AGEs differed.In the present study, we detected GA-AGEs intracellularly in SH-SY5Y cells using slot blots. GA dose-dependently increased GA-AGE levels, as shown in <Fig. 2b>. We previously investigated which types of AGEs triggered the development of AD pathology using a culture system. We showed that cell viability was markedly decreased by the addition of GA-AGEs<1><8>. In the present study, lactic acid concentrations in culture media, to which 1 mM GA had been added, were approximately 50% lower than those in the control and ACAC recovered cell viability from GA-induced cell death. These results suggested that GA induced the inhibition of glycolysis. In a study using positron emission tomography, cerebral glucose metabolism was found to be lower in AD patients than in healthy controls<14>. Needham et al. reported that GA attenuated glycolysis by inhibiting hexokinase and GAPDH<17>. Furthermore, GAPDH activity was previously reported to be reduced in AD patients<33>. The role of GAPDH in apoptosis has already been described in neurodegenerative disorders<34>. Although GA induced the expression of GAPDH in the present study, we previously reported that GA inactivated GAPDH in a neuronal culture system<8>. ACAC recovered from GA-induced cell death, suggesting that abnormalities in glycolysis may be involved in the neurotoxicity mechanism. GAPDH inactivation due to intracellular GA production further increases intracellular GA concentrations, resulting in increased GA-AGE production and nerve cell toxicity. Thus, GA-AGEs may be one of the general causative agents of the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.The brain is in direct contact with the CSF. Biological alterations that reflect pathophysiological processes in the brain are reflected in the CSF. Evidence obtained over the past 20 years has indicated that Aβ42 levels in the CSF of AD patients are significantly lower than those in age-matched healthy elderly controls, whereas total tau and p-tauT181 levels are significantly higher<35>. Furthermore, the levels of other AD biomarkers, such as VEGF<13> and TGF-β1<36>, were also found to be higher in the CSF of AD patients. Shuvaev et al. reported that glycation was greater in the CSF of AD patients than in age-matched controls<37>. In our study, GA decreased Aβ42 levels and increased total tau and p-tauT181 levels in culture media and also increased the intracellular levels of total tau, p-tauT181, VEGF, and TGF-β in SH-SY5Y cells. We were unable to determine why GA decreases Aβ42 levels and increased p-tauT181 levels in culture media. GA may have had effects on the post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation in the early stage) of p-tauT181, but not on the expression and/or secretion of Aβ42 through glycolysis inhibition. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying GA-induced AD-like alterations in diagnostic marker levels. In addition, Glu-AGEs did not induce cytotoxicity, but caused tau-phosphorylation in a culture system<38>. These findings suggest that high levels of glycation and/or GA may be mimicked by AD CSF alterations and accompanied by numerous neuropathological consequences due to GA-AGEs rather than Glu-AGEs.GA is derived from two distinct pathways, 1) a glycolytic pathway and 2) fructose metabolism pathway<39>. 1) The glycolytic intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is generally catabolized by GAPDH. As discussed above, the addition of GA to neuronal cells led to a decrease in GAPDH activity, suggesting a feed-forward mechanism; the GA-AGE-induced inactivation of GAPDH may further stimulate the generation of GA-AGEs. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH-related neurotoxicity by GA. 2) Under hyperglycemic conditions, an increase in intracellular glucose has been shown to stimulate the polyol pathway to generate fructose in insulin-independent tissues, including the brain and nerve tissue<40>. Fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate and then catabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and GA by liver aldolase B<41>, and GA promotes the formation of GA-AGEs. Moreover, previous studies reported that aldolase B was not expressed in the rat brain<42>, whereas fructose-1-phosphate cleavage (aldolase) activity has been detected in the human brain<43>.Although the exact mechanisms underlying the target of GA-AGEs and its downstream signaling pathway currently remain unclear, the measurement of GA-AGE levels in the CSF and/or serum may be a useful biomarker for the early detection of AD. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were purchased from ECACC (The European Collection of Cell Cultures). Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and ACAC were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). GA was from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan).

Cells were cultured in DMEM on 6-well plates for 24 h, followed by the addition of various concentrations (0, 0.3, 0.7, and 1 mM) of GA, and all assays were performed after a further incubation for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using Cell counting kit-8 (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptosis was examined by fluorescent microscopy using Vybrant® Apoptosis Assay Kit #4 (Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA), in which early apoptotic cells were detected with green fluorescent YO-PRO®-1. In medium analyses, an aliquot of medium was centrifuged (600 g, 5 min, 4 °C) followed by recentrifugation of the supernatants (21,000 g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants were used. Aβ42, total tau protein, and p-tauT181 protein were examined by ELISA kits (for the tau protein, its phosphorylated form, and Aβ42, the kit was obtained from Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA). Lactic acid concentrations were measured by Determiner-LA (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan). In ACAC experiments, cells were treated with ACAC 15 min before the addition of GA."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of disability in the elderly. The formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the main hallmarks of the disorder, whereas synaptic loss best correlates to the progressive cognitive decline. Interestingly, some of the proteins involved in these pathophysiological processes have been reported to be subject to posttranslational modification by ubiquitin and/or the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). Here we investigated global changes in protein SUMOylation and ubiquitination in vivo in a model of AD. We used Tg2576 transgenic mice, which overexpress a mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene implicated in familial AD. As expected, APP protein levels were dramatically increased in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of Tg2576 mice. A significant increase in the global level of ubiquitinated proteins was observed in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Significant or close to significant changes in individual bands of SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 conjugation were apparent in all brain regions investigated, although global levels were unaltered between wild-type and transgenic mice. Levels of SUMO-specific conjugating and deconjugating enzymes, UBC9 and SENP-1 were also unaltered in any of the brain regions analysed. Surprisingly, given the well-documented loss of synaptic function, total levels of the excitatory AMPA and kainate receptors were unaffected in the Tg2576 mice. These results suggest that alterations in SUMO substrate conjugation may occur and that global posttranslational modifications by ubiquitin may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying AD. rhetorical Supplementary Fig. S1 Changes in individual SUMO-2/3- and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in Tg2576 transgenic compared to age-matched wild-type mice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and cause of dementia among the aging population (http://www.alz.co.uk/research/worldreport/). It has a complex pathophysiology, which, although not completely understood, is characterised by beta-amyloid (Aβ) senile plaques originating from cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles formed from hyperphosphorylated microtubule protein tau <[28]>. Synaptic loss is another characteristic feature of the condition and probably the best correlate of the cognitive decline that develops progressively in AD patients <[27]>. Several lines of evidence indicate that excitatory synapses are lost due to a decrease in AMPA and NMDA receptors at the cell surface caused by extracellular accumulation of Aβ <[24]>.Ubiquitination and SUMOylation are key protein modification pathways that involve a sequence of analogous but distinct enzymatic steps to covalently conjugate either ubiquitin or SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) to substrate proteins. Generally, ubiquitinated proteins are targeted to the proteasome for degradation (reviewed in <[25]>), whereas proteins tagged by one of the validated SUMO paralogues (SUMO-1 to -3, the difference between SUMO-2 and -3 being only three amino acids) can undergo changes in localisation, activity and/or stability (reviewed in <[29]>). Both ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation pathways play critical roles in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes <[22,30,32]>. High levels of ubiquitinated proteins have been observed in all major neurodegenerative disorders including AD <[18]>. Recently, alterations in global levels of SUMOylated proteins have been reported in a number of these diseases (for review see <[4]>) and several AD-associated proteins, including APP and tau, have been shown to be SUMOylated <[9,11,33]>.Tg2576 transgenic mice, which overexpress a mutated APP gene containing the Swedish familial AD mutation, are a widely recognised model of AD <[14]>. These mice exhibit elevated Aβ that lead to plaque pathology and behavioral deficits analogous to that of AD patients (for review see <[14]>). Previous in vivo and in vitro studies using Tg2576 mice have shown impairment of the ubiquitin–proteasome system as well as reduction in the surface expression of AMPA receptors <[2,3,23]>. Here we investigated potential changes in protein SUMOylation and ubiquitination patterns, SUMO-specific conjugating (UBC9) and deconjugating (SENP-1) enzymes, and levels of AMPA and kainate (KA) receptor subunits in Tg2576 mice. As expected, our results show a dramatic increase of APP protein levels in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, though surprisingly, given the reported loss of synaptic function, levels of the excitatory AMPA and KA receptors were unaffected. A robust increase in total ubiquitinated proteins was seen in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice, but not in the cortex or cerebellum. A decrease in SUMO-2/3 conjugation of high molecular weight proteins was evident in the cortex of transgenic mice, and although changes in the modification of multiple SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 conjugates were apparent in all brain regions, no other significant changes in conjugation or in levels of SUMO conjugation machinery were observed between transgenic and control mice.Animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with UK Home Office legislation and experimental protocols approved by the British National Committee for Ethics in Animal Research.Hippocampal, cortical and cerebellar regions were prepared from 9-month male Tg2576 mice and wild-type age-matched controls processed in parallel. Brains were immediately removed following cervical dislocation and dissected in ice cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, pH 7.2) containing (in mM): 1.26 CaCl2, 5.36 KCl, 136.89 NaCl, 36.08 glucose, 0.44 KH2PO4, 0.34 Na2HPO4, 0.49 MgCl2, 0.44 MgSO4, 25 HEPES and 4 NaHCO3. For each of the regions, both hemispheres were pooled together in ice-cold lysis buffer containing: 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% mammalian protease inhibitor (Roche) and 20 mM NEM (Sigma–Aldrich). For the tissue homogenisation protocol, equivalent amounts of tissue were lysed in equivalent buffer volumes, samples were sonicated for 10 s at 4 °C and total protein concentrations were determined as previously reported <[8]>.An appropriate volume of loading buffer consisting of 125 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue and 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples, which were then boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Equal amounts of protein loaded at 10–50 μg protein/lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–15%) and immunoblotting was performed as formerly described <[8]>. The primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal anti-APP (Sigma; 1:4000), mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz; 1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-SUMO-1 (1:4000) kindly provided by Dr. M."

The same blots were then re-probed with anti-β-actin antibody as an internal control to ensure equal protein loading in all lanes. Densitometry was performed on blots for each brain region and analysed using Image J (NIH). For SUMO and ubiquitin conjugate multiple bands the entire lane with a maximum range of 15–250 kDa as well as individual prominent bands were analysed. Band intensity values for the investigated proteins were normalised against the internal loading control values and the mean normalised value obtained for the wild-type group was designated as 100%.Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of the indicated number of animals. Student's t-test was applied to the means to determine differences between experimental groups. p Values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Tg2576 mice show increased APP protein levels in all brain regions analysed: To confirm that Tg2576 mice, which overexpress the Swedish double mutation (K670N, M671L) of the human APP gene, produce increased levels of APP protein compared to their age-matched controls, we performed Western blots in samples from brain regions of transgenic and wild-type mice. As expected, the transgenic mice express increased APP protein levels by at least 3-fold in the hippocampus (<Fig. 1>A), cortex (<Fig. 1>B) and cerebellum (<Fig. 1>C). The increase in APP protein levels in the transgenic mice provides increased substrate for β-secretase, an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves APP to produce Aβ, increased levels of which, in turn, lead to amyloid plaque accumulation in this mouse model (for reviews see <[12]>).Levels of protein SUMOylation and ubiquitination in Tg2576 mice: To determine if Tg2576 mice show modified SUMOylation and/or ubiquitination of substrate proteins, immunodetection using antibodies against SUMO-1, SUMO-2/3 and ubiquitin was performed in blots containing samples from Tg2576 and age-matched wild-type mice. The global levels and individual bands of posttranslationally modified proteins were analysed for hippocampus (<Fig. 2>A), cortex (<Fig. 2>B) and cerebellum (<Fig. 2>C).Since global levels of SUMOylated proteins have been reported to be increased in a number of neurodegenerative diseases (for review see <[4]>) and key proteins in AD have been implicated as SUMO substrates or SUMO-interacting proteins <[9,10,20,33]>, we hypothesised that altered levels of SUMO-conjugated substrates might be evident in Tg2576 mice. Conjugation by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 displayed similar global levels in both transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice in all of the brain regions analysed (<Fig. 2>A–C, left and centre panels). Similarly, the, global levels of ubiquitin conjugates in the cortex and cerebellar regions were analogous between transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice (<Fig. 2>B and C, right panels). In contrast, however, global levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice were significantly increased compared to age-matched wild-type mice (<Fig. 2>A, right panel).Analysis of a selection of prominent bands revealed significant or very close to significant changes in SUMO-1, SUMO-2/3 and ubiquitin conjugation levels of individual proteins (<Table 1>). In the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice, although increases in individual bands for SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 were apparent, these changes did not reach significance. Individual bands for SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 in the cortex show apparent decreases: most strikingly, two high molecular weight SUMO-2/3 conjugates at ∼130 and ∼150 kDa showed a significant decrease (<Supplementary Fig. 1A>). In the cerebellum, distinct bands in the SUMO-1 blot showed increases which were close to significance at ∼100 kDa and ∼60 kDa, whereas no other bands showed apparent alterations. In conjunction with the global changes in ubiquitin conjugation, several individual ubiquitin bands were significantly increased in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice (<Supplementary Fig. 1B>). In contrast, no significant changes in ubiquitination were evident in the cortex and cerebellum.SUMO-specific conjugating and deconjugating enzymes protein levels in Tg2576 mice: To further investigate alterations in protein SUMOylation in this model, we analysed the protein levels of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, UBC9, and the SUMO-specific isopeptidase, SENP-1. Neither enzyme was significantly altered between the Tg2576 and age-matched wild-type mice (<Fig. 3>A–C).AMPA receptor subunit, GluA1, and KA receptor subunits, GluK2/3, protein levels in Tg2576 mice: Since synaptic dysfunction and/or loss is highly implicated as an early event in the pathophysiology of AD <[24]>, we investigated total levels of the AMPA and KA receptor subunits, GluA1 and GluK2/3, respectively, in the Tg2576 mice using the same tissue samples monitored for ubiquitination and SUMOylation. The total levels of GluA1 and GluK2/3 were not altered in any of the brain regions analysed in Tg2576 compared to age-matched wild-type mice (<Fig. 4>A–C).Our results confirm that APP protein levels are dramatically increased in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of Tg2576 mice. Moreover, a significant increase in the global levels of ubiquitinated proteins, as well as several distinct molecular weight conjugates, was observed in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Interestingly, significant decreases in distinct high molecular weight SUMO-2/3 conjugates were seen in the cortex of Tg2576 mice. Although multiple SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 bands appear to be altered in brain regions investigated, no other significant changes were detected. Levels of the SUMOylating, UBC9, and deSUMOylating, SENP-1, enzymes were also unaltered in any of the Tg2576 mice brain regions analysed. Surprisingly, given the reported loss of synaptic function <[13,17]>, total levels of the excitatory AMPA and kainate neurotransmitter receptors were unaffected in the Tg2576 mice at the age we investigated.Under pathological conditions, including AD, ubiquitin immunoreactive inclusion bodies accumulate, proteasomal activity is decreased and deubiquitinating enzymes that promote the degradation of accumulated proteins are downregulated <[7,19]>. In the brains of Tg2576 mice, it has been reported that the ubiquitin–proteasome activity decreases with age while the Aβ levels increase <[23]>. In agreement with that previous study, we observed a significant increase in the global levels of ubiquitinated proteins in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice, but not in the cortex or cerebellum. The proteins that are increasingly conjugated to ubiquitin in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice remain unknown and to identify these was beyond the scope of our study.Several AD-associated proteins, including APP and tau, have been reported as SUMO substrates <[9,11,33]>. APP can be covalently modified by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2, with these modifications resulting in decreased production of Aβ <[33]>. In addition, SUMO-2/3 has been variously reported to either increase <[10]> or decrease <[20]> Aβ production. Further, it has been reported that tau can be both SUMOylated and ubiquitinated, and that proteasome inhibition increased tau ubiquitination and decreased tau SUMOylation <[9]>. Intriguingly, a polymorphism in the non-coding region of UBC9 has been reported to predominate in AD patients, although the functional relevance of this observation was not investigated <[1]>."
PMC3176896_2,"Furthermore, overexpression of UBC9 led to decreases in Aβ aggregation levels, and a localisation of UBC9 in the endoplasmic reticulum where cleavage of APP by β-secretase is thought to occur, suggesting a role of the SUMO machinery in the regulation of amyloidogenic processing of APP <[33]> Changes in global levels of protein SUMOylation in the Tg2576 AD model have not been investigated previously. However, recent reports have suggested differentiated patterns of SUMO conjugation in acute cell stress, such as brain ischemia <[8,31]>, and in diseases characterised by the aggregation of misfolded aberrant protein or polyglutamine-related pathologies (reviewed in <[4,10,22]>). We, and others, have previously demonstrated that SUMOylation is rapidly, dramatically and long-lastingly increased in diverse acute neurodegenerative models of cerebral ischemia <[8,31]>. Based on these published results, we anticipated that we would detect altered SUMOylation levels in Tg2576 mice, together with, or independent from, changes in SUMOylation-specific enzymatic machinery.Levels of ubiquitination were robustly increased in the hippocampus with significant increases in global levels as well as for individual bands. Thus, protein ubiquitination in the vulnerable hippocampus is altered in the transgenic mice, which may reflect a dysfunction of the ubiquitin–proteasomal degradation system. In the cortex, significantly decreased levels of SUMO-2/3 conjugation were observed for distinct high molecular weight bands at ∼150 kDa and ∼130 kDa. This suggests that the SUMOylation level of these proteins may be affected and an important task will be to identify these SUMO substrates to define their relevance to AD. The significant differences seen in ubiquitin and SUMO-2/3 conjugation in the hippocampal and cortical regions are intriguing, as these regions are particularly vulnerable in the pathophysiology of AD and merit further investigation.Total levels of the SUMO-specific conjugating enzyme, UBC9, and the dual-acting deconjugating and SUMO-maturating enzyme, SENP-1, are not altered between Tg2576 and age-matched wild-type mice. However, it is important to stress that these observations do not rule out changes in subcellular distribution or activity of these enzymes. Levels of additional components of the SUMO pathway were not explored, such as E3 ligases, which assist in substrate specificity and conjugation, and other SENP isoforms, with distinct cellular roles emerging <[30]>.The development of senile plaques in the brains of Tg2576 mice starts after 10 months of age, whereas the synaptic activity is reduced from 8 months <[13]>. So at the age we investigated (9 months) synaptic transmission is impaired but plaques are not yet evident. The mechanisms underlying synaptic function deficits in AD have yet to be fully explained but there is evidence to suggest that soluble oligomeric Aβ rather than plaques cause impaired synaptic function <[5]>. Surface expression of AMPA receptors, in particular the GluA1 subunit, is reduced in some transgenic APP overexpression models <[3,6]>, which may result from changes to AMPA receptor trafficking pathways <[16]>. To our knowledge, levels of KA receptors have not been assessed in AD models, although the activity of these receptors is affected by Aβ in vivo
<[26]>. Moreover, we reported that multiple SUMOylation targets are present at synapses and that SUMOylation can regulate the function of KA receptors <[21]>. The fact that we did not observe loss of either AMPA or KA receptors might be due to small changes beyond detection using immunoblotting and/or by the possibility that loss of function of these receptors results from reduced surface expression due to internalisation rather than degradation. An alternative possibility is that the deficit in synaptic transmission arises from reduced presynaptic release rather than changes in postsynaptic AMPA and/or KA receptors.Our results suggest that global posttranslational modification of hippocampal proteins by ubiquitin and altered SUMO-2/3 conjugation in the cortex may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying AD. Identification of these ubiquitin and SUMO substrates and elucidation of their functional roles and regulation by ubiquitination and SUMOylation will undoubtedly lead to new and important insights into the pathophysiology of AD. rhetorical Fig. 1 APP protein levels are increased in Tg2576 transgenic mice in all brain regions analysed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of disability in the elderly. The formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the main hallmarks of the disorder, whereas synaptic loss best correlates to the progressive cognitive decline. Interestingly, some of the proteins involved in these pathophysiological processes have been reported to be subject to posttranslational modification by ubiquitin and/or the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). Here we investigated global changes in protein SUMOylation and ubiquitination in vivo in a model of AD. We used Tg2576 transgenic mice, which overexpress a mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene implicated in familial AD. As expected, APP protein levels were dramatically increased in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of Tg2576 mice. A significant increase in the global level of ubiquitinated proteins was observed in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Significant or close to significant changes in individual bands of SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 conjugation were apparent in all brain regions investigated, although global levels were unaltered between wild-type and transgenic mice. Levels of SUMO-specific conjugating and deconjugating enzymes, UBC9 and SENP-1 were also unaltered in any of the brain regions analysed. Surprisingly, given the well-documented loss of synaptic function, total levels of the excitatory AMPA and kainate receptors were unaffected in the Tg2576 mice. These results suggest that alterations in SUMO substrate conjugation may occur and that global posttranslational modifications by ubiquitin may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying AD. ."
PMC2739831_0,"The microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated form, aggregates into insoluble paired-helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. In AD, there are approximately 8 mol of phosphate per mol of tau distributed among approximately 30 PHF phosphorylation sites as compared to 2–3 phosphate per mol in normal brain. In AD, kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) are believed to be involved in generation of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, the functional consequences of hyperphosphorylation on the microtubule binding and polymerization of tau are not well understood. To address this question, we have generated pseudo-hyperphosphorylation mutants consisting of six and seven sites in the proline rich region and carboxy-terminus of tau by amino acid substitution. In addition, several single, double and triple pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were also generated. Pseudo-phosphorylation of tau decreases its affinity for microtubules, and pseudo-hyperphosphorylated forms of tau do not have significantly decreased microtubule binding as compared to single and double-sites. Three pseudo-hyperphosphorylated forms of tau with altered SDS-PAGE migration have a greater effect on its inducer mediated polymerization, slowing the rate of nucleation and elongation. Based on the observations that pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause for the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer’s disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation. rhetorical Figure 1 A) Diagram of phosphorylation sites on full-length tau.

This work was supported by NIH AG022428 (TCG) and NIH AG025898 (TCG). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a prominent hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other related neurodegenerative disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (reviewed in (1))."
PMC2739831_1,"Although the role of NFTs in Alzheimer’s disease is not clear, the location and amount of NFTs directly correlate with the type and severity of cognitive impairment (<2>, <3>)  NFTs contain large amounts of abnormal protein deposits in the form of straight and paired-helical filaments (<4>, <5>) that are composed almost entirely of the microtubule-associated protein tau (<6>–<9>) in a hyperphosphorylated state (<6>). Tau protein is a soluble protein that normally functions to promote the assembly and stabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton (<10>), and phosphorylation of tau is known to alter its functions (reviewed in (<11>)). However, it is still unclear how tau hyperphosphorylation is linked to its aggregation and neuronal degeneration observed in these diseases.At least 30 phosphorylation sites in PHF tau, about half of which are proline-directed sites, have been identified by mass spectrometry and phospho-amino acid analysis or by phosphorylation-specific monoclonal antibodies. (reviewed in (<11>, <12>)). The kinase(s) responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD is not clear. It has been suggested that more than one combination of kinases and/or phospatases might be involved in converting normal tau to hyperphosphorylated tau (<13>). The proline-directed kinase GSK-3β is believed to be involved in this process since it phosphorylates tau at many of the same sites that are found to be phosphorylated in paired helical filaments of AD (<14>–<17>), and active GSK-3β is associated with the development of NFTs in AD (<18>). According to our previous observations, GSK-3β phosphorylates soluble and polymerized tau at a minimum of eleven and five sites respectively (<19>, <20>). Phosphorylation at these sites does not change the amount of tau polymerization, but is sufficient to cause tau filaments to coalesce into tangle-like aggregates similar to those isolated from Alzheimer’s disease brain (<19>, <20>).Due to the number and proximity of tau phosphorylation, in combination with the relative promiscuity with which most kinases act upon tau, the use of kinases to investigate the effects of specific sites on the function of tau is virtually impossible. It is therefore common for these investigations to employ site-directed mutagenesis to generate pseudo-phosphorylation variants of tau (<21>–<28>), although this approach is unlikely to completely mimic phosphorylative changes. We previously showed that the amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for serines or threonines to generate pseudo-phosphorylation mutations at S202 and T205 resulted in only subtle effects on the polymerization characteristics and microtubule binding of tau (<28>). However, it is not known whether adding additional pseudo-phosphorylation sites that are normally phosphorylated by GSK-3β to generate a “pseudo-hyperphosphorylation” version of tau has a greater effect on its function. To address this question, we have generated pseudo-hyperphosphorylated variants with six (6-phos) and seven (7-phos) pseudo-phosphorylation changes. The sites chosen for investigation include the five sites that are phosphorylated by GSK-3β when tau is in a polymerized state (S199, T205, T231, S396 and S404) (<20>). 6-phos also included pseudo-phosphorylation at S202. S202 was added to the core five sites since the AT8 antibody recognizes phosphorylation of tau at both S199 and S202 (<29>), and antibodies to S202 alone were not available for our previous study of GSK3β phosphorylation of tau. Similarly, S235, which is recognized in combination with T231 by the TG-3 antibody (<30>), was added to 6-phos to generate a 7-phos mutant. Single, double and triple pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were also investigated to control for the possibility that fewer sites could have similar effects to the pseudo-hyperphosphorylated versions of tau. In addition to S199, S202, T205, T231, S235, S396 and S404, other sites were also investigated. T212E was included since it has previously be shown to promote the in vitro assembly of tau to a high level (<26>). S208D, S210D and S208/210D were also included. These sites are not phosphorylated by GSK-3β, but are in the same proline-rich region of tau that the majority of GSK-3β phosphorylation sites are found. They are known to be phosphorylated by tau-tubulin kinase (TTK) (<31>) and are also phosphorylated in PHF tau (<32>). The pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were assayed for changes in SDS-PAGE migration, microtubule binding and arachidonic acid-induced polymerization. We have made two key observations: most pseudo-phosphorylation and pseudo-hyperphosphorylation variants decrease the microtubule binding of tau in a fashion similar to GSK-3β phosphorylated tau, and kinetic analyses of polymerization indicate that pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau mimics with AD-like changes in SDS-PAGE electrophoretic mobility have increased lag times and reduced apparent rates of elongation compared to single or paired mimics. These results suggest a possible mechanism for the increased toxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in vivo. Arachidonic acid was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), IPTG from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), SDS-PAGE protein marker from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD), urea from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), and uranyl acetate and formvar carbon coated grids from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA). Wild-type, P301L and pseudo-phosphorylation mutant tau protein (441 amino acids) were expressed and purified as described previously (<28>). Pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). S/T to E mutants and S/T to D mutants were generated at amino acids S199 and T231. S199E was found to have indistinguishable polymerization characteristics as S199D (not shown). T231E and T231D were also indistinguishable in their polymerization (not shown). Protein concentration was determined by a commercial BCA assay from Pierce Chemical (Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) as a standard. Protein samples (1 μg per lane) were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 1% beta-mercapto-ethanol, fractionated on 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (<33>). For denaturing SDS-PAGE, protein samples (1 μg per lane) were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 1% beta-mercapto-ethanol and 6 M urea. Samples were fractionated on 15% SDS-PAGE with 6 M urea and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (<33>). 2 μM tau protein (wild-type and pseudo-phosphorylation tau mutants) was incubated in polymerization buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.64, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT) at room temperature in the presence of 75 μM arachidonic acid (ARA) (in ethanol, final concentration: 3.75%) in the 5 × 5 mm optical glass fluorometer cuvettes (Starna Cells, Atascadero, CA) (<34>). The amount of polymerization was monitored by LLS at regular intervals for 20 hr with 5 mW solid state laser (λ= 475 nm, B & W Tek, Inc., Newark, DE). Images were captured at a right angle to the incident light using a SONY XC-ST270 digital camera. Captured images were imported into Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1 and the intensity of the scattered light was measured as described previously (<28>). The pictures were captured at an aperture of f5.6–8 or f8 and then normalized to the intensity corresponded to the exposure at f5.6–8. The data were fit to a non-linear Gompertz function: 
 where y is the value of laser light scattering measured at time t; a is the maximum amount of light scattering; ti is the point of inflection where the increase in scattering is at its maximum; and b is equal to 1/kapp. kapp is proportional to the rate of polymerization (<26>). The lag time for polymerization, or the amount of time required to observe significant amounts of polymerization, was calculated using the formula: ti − b (<26>). The Gompertz function has been used as a model for growth curves (<35>), including as a model for tau polymerization (<26>)."
PMC2739831_2,"Errors in the kinetics parameters were assessed by individually fitting three separate kinetics experiments to the Gompertz function to obtain three independent measures of LLSmax, kapp and lag times  These values were averaged and reported ± standard deviation. Tau polymerization reactions were diluted 10-fold with polymerization buffer then fixed with glutaraldehyde (2% final concentration) for 5 min. Ten microliters of fixed reactions were placed on formvar-carbon coated grids (1 min), washed with water, blotted, washed with 2% uranyl acetate, blotted, stained with 2% uranyl acetate (1 min), then blotted dry. Grids were viewed with a TECNAI G2 20 electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) and digital images were captured with the Gatan Digital Micrograph imaging system. The microtubule binding assay was performed in general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, pH 7, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA). Tau protein ranging from 0.125 μM to 10 μM were mixed with paclitaxel stabilized microtubules at a final concentration of 1.62 μM tubulin dimer in a 50 μL reaction. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and centrifuged in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 5 min to sediment the microtubules and tau bound to the microtubules. The pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and microtubules were separated from tau bound to microtubules by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of tau bound to the microtubules was determined by the intensity of tau band by Adobe Photoshop and normalized to the intensity of tubulin band. The tau band was normalized to the intensity of the tubulin bands in each lane to account for any differences in centrifugation or resuspension of samples because the amount of tubulin should be constant in all binding reactions. The amount of free tau was determined by subtracting the amount of bound tau from the total amount of tau. The concentration of bound tau were plotted versus the concentration of free tau in GraphPad Prism and fit to a one site binding (hyperbola) equation. Hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is phosphorylated at a molar ratio of approximately 5–9 mol phosphate per mol of tau whereas normal tau contains only 2–3 mol phosphate per mol of tau (<36>). However, the role of this hyperphosphorylation is poorly understood. To better understand the effects of tau hyperphosphorylation, pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were constructed. We chose to focus on the five sites known to be phosphorylated by GSK-3β in vitro when arachidonic acid-induced tau filaments are used as the substrate (S199, T205, T231, S396 and S404) (<20>). Pseudo-phosphorylation changes at S202 were added to generate the 6-phos, and both S202 and S235 were added to generate 7-phos (<Figure 1A>). These sites were included since S202 is often found phosphorylated along with S199, and S235 is often found phosphorylated along with T231. Single, paired and triplet mutants were investigated to determine whether fewer sites might also have an effect on the function of tau (<Figure 1A>). We also investigated a GSK-3β site in the same proline rich region but not among the sites above (T212) as a control. As further controls, non-proline directed sites S208, S210 and S208/S210 were investigated. The disease causing P301L tau mutation was included in the analyses as a positive control. Alzheimer’s disease hyperphosphorylated tau and recombinant tau phosphorylated by GSK-3β in vitro have an upward band shift when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<19>, <37>). This upward band shift is the definitive characteristic of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurodegenerative disorders (<1>). To determine whether the pseudo-phosphorylation mutants can cause this upward band shift, the pseudo-phosphorylation forms of tau were analyzed by coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. S199/S202/T205E, S396/S404E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos had an upward shift in mobility compared to wild-type tau (<Figure 1B>). The apparent molecular masses for wild-type, S199/S202/T205E, S396/S404E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos were 70 kDa, 72 kDa, 75 kDa, 78 kDa and 78 kDa, respectively. P301L tau and all other pseudo-phosphorylation mutants did not show a change in mobility (data not shown). The mobility shift of pseudo-phosphorylation mutants was reduced in the presence of 6M urea (molecular weights for wild-type, S199/S202/T205E, S396/S404E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos were 70 kDa, 70 kDa, 71 kDa, 72 kDa and 72 kDa, respectively, <Figure 1C>). This phenomenon of altered mobility in SDS that is abolished in urea has been described in the literature as a SDS-resistant change in conformation (<33>, <38>–<41>). Because S199/S202/T205E, S396/S404E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos all demonstrated an AD-like shift in mobility as a result of phosphorylation-like changes, we conclude that they have the characteristics of hyperphosphorylated tau. These mutants will therefore be referred to as pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the manuscript. Because FTDP-17 mutations (<42>) and pseudo-phosphorylation mutations (<28>) in tau can alter its interactions with microtubules, we measured the microtubule binding affinity of P301L tau and fifteen pseudo-phosphorylation mutants using a centrifugation assay (<43>). Pellets containing microtubules and bound tau were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (<Figure 2A>). The concentration of tau bound to the microtubules was determined by the intensity of tau band and normalized to the intensity of tubulin band (<Figure 2A>). Normalization of the amount of tau relative to tubulin was performed to take into account any differences in sedimentation or resuspension of the pellets. The concentration of free tau was calculated by subtracting the measured bound tau from the total tau added to the reaction. The amount of bound tau was plotted against free tau. Two representative curves (wild-type tau and 7-Phos) are shown in <Figure 2B>. The data were fit to a simple one-site binding equation to determine the affinity of binding (Kd) and the maximal amount of bound tau (Bmax) (<Figure 2C and 2D>). All proteins examined, with the exception of S199E, S202E and S208D, had significantly lower affinities for microtubules than was observed with wild-type tau (<Figure 2B>). The decreases in binding affinity were all in the 2–3 fold reduction range, which is in general agreement with previously published reports of GSK-3β phosphorylation of tau (<44>) and the P301L mutation (<42>). The stoichiometry of binding to microtubules was not greatly affected (<Figure 2C>). To determine whether pseudo-phosphorylation mutations of tau have an effect on the arachidonic acid (ARA) induction of tau polymerization, each protein at a final concentration of 2 μM was incubated in the presence of 75 μM ARA. This protein to inducer ratio was chosen since it has been shown to be the optimal condition for the arachidonic acid induction of wild-type tau polymerization (<34>). The kinetics of polymerization of each mutant were followed by right angle laser light scattering and compared to wild-type tau. Representative curves are shown in <Figure 3A>. The data were fit to a Gompertz function to determine the maximal amount of light scattering (LLSmax) (<Figure 3B>), the apparent proportional growth rate (kapp, <Figure 3C>), and the lag time of polymerization (<Figure 3D>). No significant increases in polymerization were observed for the pseudo-phosphorylation mutants (<Figure 3B>), although the FTDP-17 mutation P301L did have a significant increase in the extent of polymerization compared to wild-type, as expected (<45>). Several pseudo-phosphorylation variants (S202/T205E, S199/S202/T205E, S208/S210D, T231E, S396/S404E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos) had significantly less maximal polymerization as compared to wild-type.The apparent proportional growth rate, kapp, was not significantly altered for most of the mutants (<Figure 3C>)."
PMC2739831_3,"The FTDP-17 mutation P301L has been shown to have the most dramatic effects in increasing the apparent rate of polymerization as compared to wild-type tau protein (<45>), and had a significantly greater kapp than wild-type tau and all the pseudo-phosphorylation mutants  Mutants S210D and T231D also had significantly greater kapp values than wild type, but still less than P301L tau (<Figure 3C>). S199/S202/T205E, 6-phos and 7-phos all had significantly lower kapp than wild type tau (<Figure 3C>).Nucleation-elongation polymerization pathways are also typically characterized by a lag time in the polymerization process. Wild type tau had a lag time of 19 minutes (<Figure 3D>). P301L tau had a significantly reduced lag time, as expected (<45>). S210D, S208/S210D, T231E and T231E/S235D also had significantly reduced lag times, but greater than P301L tau (<Figure 3D>). 6-phos had a significantly longer lag time than wild type tau (<Figure 3D>). On average, S199/S202/T205E and 7-Phos had longer lag times than wild type, but these differences did not reach statistical significance (<Figure 3D>). To determine whether filament morphology (number and length of filaments) was changed by pseudo-phosphorylation, samples from polymerization reactions were prepared and viewed by TEM (<Figure 4>). Filaments from six fields of view were combined into a single data set and then ranked according to their length (examples are shown <Figure 5A>). Particles less than 15nm in their longest dimension were not included in the analysis because particles smaller than this cutoff value are smaller than the average filament width of arachidonic acid induced filaments (<19>), and therefore difficult to distinguish from background. In general, pseudo-phosphorylation mutants tended to form fewer but longer filaments than wild-type tau (<Figure 5B and 5C>). The standard deviation of the average lengths was roughly equal to the value of the average lengths for most proteins, as is expected for exponentially distributed data (<46>). The standard error of the mean is also shown, as this is an estimate of the accuracy of the determination of the true mean. Among these mutants, the three with the most phosphorylation sites formed the longest filaments (S199/S202/T20E5, 6-Phos and 7-Phos) (<Figure 5C>). However, the overall amount of filament formation observed in six fields was relatively similar for most all proteins (<Figure 5D>), with the possible exceptions of T231E, S202/T205E, T205E and S396/404E which seemed to have somewhat reduced levels of polymerization compared to the other proteins (<Figure 5D>). In general, pseudo-phosphorylation of tau resulted in fewer, but longer filaments as compared to wild-type (<Figure 4> and <5>). In contrast, the rapidly polymerizing P301L formed more, but shorter filaments than wild-type tau, resulting in an overall increase in the amount of polymerized material (<Figure 5A–D>).Quantitative analysis of differences between the filaments is difficult due to the differences in the number of filaments, the variability in filament distribution on the TEM grid, the biological variability in filament lengths, and the exponential distribution of filament lengths. Therefore, it is possible that the apparent differences in filament length distributions (<Figure 5>) could be due to differences in sampling. We therefore measured 500 filaments for each mutant and determined the number-average length (Ln=(ΣNiLi)/(ΣNi), <Figure 6>) for each mutant (<47>). With the exception of T231, all pseudo-phosphorylation mutants had greater average filament lengths than wild type protein. This analysis also confirmed that S199/S202/T205E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos had the greatest tendencies for forming long filaments. Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. Many kinases have been shown to be involved in this phosphorylation process, and GSK-3β is believed to be a major contributor to tau/PHF phosphorylation (reviewed in (<11>)). In previous studies, we found that GSK-3β phosphorylation of pre-formed tau filaments at sites including S199, T205, T231, S396 and S404 can cause tau filaments to coalesce into NFT-like structures (<20>). Because these five sites are recognized by specific AD-associated antibodies, we sought to test whether pseudo-phosphorylation at these sites would have an impact on the function of tau (summarized in <Table 1>). Phosphorylation of tau at specific sites has been suggested to correlate with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), raising the possibility that a major function of tau phosphorylation is to promote tau polymerization (<48>). Under conditions that we have determined to be optimal for wild-type tau polymerization (<34>), pseudo-phosphorylation of tau mildly reduced its polymerization, which is consistent with previously published reports using in vitro GSK-3β phosphorylated tau (<19>, <49>). The kinetics of polymerization for most of the single and double phosphorylation variants were not significantly changed (<Table 1>). However, the pseudo-hyperphosphorylated version of tau (S199/S202/T205E, 6-Phos and 7-Phos) had a drastically decreased rate of elongation and a pronounced lag time. This suggests a deficiency in the nucleation step for the pseudo-hyperphosphorylation mimics. The observation of fewer but longer filaments with pseudo-hyperphosphorylation mutants agree with this idea.The effect on filament nucleation and filament length was greatest with the “pseudo-hyperphosphorylated” versions of tau. 6-phos and 7-phos were generated from the combination of multiple pseudo-phosphorylation sites in both the proline-rich and C-terminal regions of tau. The effects on polymerization of 6-phos and 7-phos seem to be greater than those observed by the heparin (<49>) or arachidonic acid (<19>) induction of GSK-3β phosphorylated tau polymerization. However, GSK-3β phosphorylation in vitro only results in 2–4 mol phosphate incorporation per mol of tau distributed unequally over as many as fourteen sites (<19>, <20>, <49>–<51>). 6-phos and 7-phos are homogeneous in their modifications and therefore are more highly modified than the average GSK-3β phosphorylated tau protein.Our previous studies have shown that the presence of arachidonic acid drastically reduces the energetic barrier for the nucleation of polymerization (<34>). The observation that pseudo-hyperphosphorylation mutants are less likely to nucleate could be explained by diminished interactions with arachidonic acid as a result of altered conformations of the proteins conferred by pseudo-phosphorylation. In support of this, the pseudo-hyperphosphorylated proteins had altered SDS-PAGE electrophoretic mobility that was abolished in the presence of urea. This phenomenon has been described as an SDS-resistant change in conformation of tau (<33>, <38>–<41>), and indicates that pseudo-phosphorylated proteins could interact differently with SDS or with arachidonic acid.It should be mentioned that a previous report found that pseudo-phosphorylation of tau at several sites (including S199, S199/S202/T205 and T212) enhanced polymerization by 2–3 fold over non-modified tau (<26>). We obtain similar results when using concentrations of arachidonic acid that inhibit wild type tau polymerization (125–150 μM, data not shown). It is not clear whether these results at high inducer to protein ratios have physiological relevance, but they are consistent with the hypothesis that pseudo-phosphorylation of tau can decrease its interactions with arachidonic acid. Most pseudo-phosphorylation forms of tau significantly decreased microtubule binding by 2–3 fold without significantly changing the saturation levels (<Table 1>), which agrees with previous studies investigating the effects of tau phosphorylation at proline-directed phosphorylation sites (<49>). However, results from multiple site constructs were not consistently additive. For example, both T231E and S235D had lower affinities than wild-type for microtubules."
PMC2739831_4,"However, the T231E/S235D double mutant had an affinity similar to the individual mutations  And while S202/T205E had a lower affinity for microtubules than the individual mutants, the addition of S199E to form S199/S202/T205E actually improved microtubule binding (albeit at a lower affinity than wild-type tau). The constructs with six or seven pseudo-phosphorylation sites did not show dramatically different levels of microtubule binding than single or double mutants. We conclude that microtubule binding is regulated in a complicated site-specific fashion, and the levels of phosphorylation are less of a determinant of microtubule binding than the actual sites involved. Since the establishment of the correlation between the number of NFTs with the degree of dementia in AD, NFTs have been widely accepted as a toxic species in AD (reviewed in (<52>)). However, recent observations in tau-expressing cultured cell, transgenic Drosophila and mouse models suggest that the toxicity is independent of NFT formation and NFTs may form as a result of cellular attempts to reduce toxicity (reviewed in (<53>)). NFTs contain large amounts of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (<6>) in the form of straight and paired-helical filaments (<4>, <5>). The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is one of the post-translational modifications of tau known to be related to toxicity, filament formation and the formation of NFTs (reviewed in (<54>)). The apparent phosphorylation-dependent toxicity of tau could be due to the disruption of microtubule dynamics through sequestration of normal tau (<55>–<57>), and could be reduced through the polymerization of phosphorylated tau (<58>). Additionally, the presence of soluble hyperphosphorylated tau is correlated with cognitive deficiencies in a transgenic mouse model (<59>). These results suggest that tau aggregation could protect against phosphorylation-induced microtubule disruption and subsequent neurodegeneration.Our results provide a potential biochemical mechanism for the potential cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau. Phosphorylated tau binds to microtubules less tightly, so that there would be an increase in cytoplasmic tau and increased microtubule instability. It has also been shown through other work that hyperphosphorylated tau may sequester normal tau (<56>), further disrupting microtubule dynamics. Pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau also has a decreased rate of polymerization, potentially increasing the amount of time it is soluble in the cytoplasm where it could sequester normal tau. It is also possible that the fibrillization of abnormally phosphorylated tau could protect cells from toxic effects. We have previously shown tau phosphorylation by GSK-3β is sufficient to induce the bundling tau filaments into NFT-like structures in a cell-free in vitro system (<20>). These observations are consistent with data from transgenic mouse models showing that NFT formation is not necessarily the toxic element of neurodegeneration and may instead play a protective role (<59>–<61>). The microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated form, aggregates into insoluble paired-helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. In AD, there are approximately 8 mol of phosphate per mol of tau distributed among approximately 30 PHF phosphorylation sites as compared to 2–3 phosphate per mol in normal brain. In AD, kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) are believed to be involved in generation of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, the functional consequences of hyperphosphorylation on the microtubule binding and polymerization of tau are not well understood. To address this question, we have generated pseudo-hyperphosphorylation mutants consisting of six and seven sites in the proline rich region and carboxy-terminus of tau by amino acid substitution. In addition, several single, double and triple pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were also generated. Pseudo-phosphorylation of tau decreases its affinity for microtubules, and pseudo-hyperphosphorylated forms of tau do not have significantly decreased microtubule binding as compared to single and double-sites. Three pseudo-hyperphosphorylated forms of tau with altered SDS-PAGE migration have a greater effect on its inducer mediated polymerization, slowing the rate of nucleation and elongation. Based on the observations that pseudo-hyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause for the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer’s disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation. ."
PMC3945161_0,"Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3β is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including the heightened levels of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurodegeneration. In this study we used 12 month old SAMP8 mice, an AD model, to examine the effects GSK-3β may cause regarding the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress associated with AD. To suppress the level of GSK-3β, SAMP8 mice were treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (GAO) directed at this kinase. We measured a decreased level of GSK-3β in the cortex of the mice, indicating the success of the antisense treatment. Learning and memory assessments of the SAMP8 mice were tested post-antisense treatment using an aversive T-maze and object recognition test, both of which observably improved. In cortex samples of the SAMP8 mice, decreased levels of protein carbonyl and protein-bound HNE were measured indicating decreased oxidative stress. Nuclear factor erythroid -2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor known to increase the level of many antioxidants, including glutathione-S transferase (GST), and is negatively regulated by the activity of GSK-3β. Our results indicated the increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 and level of GST, suggesting the increased activity of the transcription factor as a result of GSK-3β suppression, consistent with the decreased oxidative stress observed. Consistent with the improved learning and memory, and consistent with GSK-3b being a tau kinase, we observed decreased tau phosphorylation in brain of GAO-treated SAMP8 mice compared to that of RAO-treated SAMP8 mice. Lastly, we examined the ability of GAO to cross the blood-brain barrier and determined it to be possible. The results presented in this study demonstrate that reducing GSK-3 with a phosphorothionated antisense against GSK-3 improves learning and memory, reduces oxidative stress, possibly coincident with increased levels of the antioxidant transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and decreases tau phosphorylation. Our study supports the notion of GAO as a possible treatment for AD. This work was supported by a NIH grant to D.A.B [AG-05119] and grants to S.A.F. [VA Merit Review] and Edunn Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that, according to the Alzheimer’s Association website [<1>], affects 5.4 million Americans today, costing an estimated $200 billion in 2012 to care for these individuals. Pathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-beta (Aβ)-plaques, two primary hallmarks of the disease, as well as a heightened oxidative environment in the brain and subsequent neurodegeneration. Clinically, individuals affected by AD experience a progressive cognitive decline in learning and memory which eventually leads to a highly compromised quality of life. Aβ-oligomers and NFTs are associated with the cognitive decline characteristic of the disorder [<2>]. To date there is no treatment which can stop or reverse the dysfunctions produced by the disorder.Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β is a pleiotropic enzyme involved in a variety of cell activities, and has been postulated as a therapeutic target for AD due to its multiple connections to the pathology of the disease [<3>, <4>]. Brains from Alzheimer’s subjects reportedly have increased GSK-3β-associated NFTs, tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration [<5>–<12>]. There are two isoforms of GSK-3, α and β, both of which reportedly elicit an increase in Aβ [<8>, <13>–<17>]. However, the involvement of GSK-3 in the phosphorylation of presenilin-1 (PS-1) which leads to increased production of Aβ is unclear [<18>]. In the brain, GSK-3β is the predominant kinase that phosphorylates tau, resulting in the hyperphosphorylation and related NFT generation of AD [<19>–<23>].Antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is among the many substrates negatively regulated by GSK-3β and is thought to have neuroprotective effects [<24>–<27>]. The main role of Nrf2 is to protect the cell against increased oxidative insults and thought to be regulated by cellular localization. In the absence of oxidative stress Nrf2 is bound to the chaperone protein Keap1, which sequesters the transcription factor in the cytosol [<28>–<30>]. During increased oxidative insults, Nrf2 disassociates from Keap1 and translocates to the nucleus where it up-regulates the transcription of over a hundred antioxidant genes, mainly phase II enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), γ-glutamylcysteine ligase, heme oxygenase-1, and glutathione peroxidase [<31>, <32>].The SAMP8 mouse is a model of AD that develops deficits in learning and memory by 8 months of age [<33>, <34>]. Correlated with the cognitive impairments, SAMP8 mice exhibit an age-related increase in Aβ, Tau phosphorylation, and oxidative stress [<35>–<38>].The cognitive deficits can be reversed by lowering Aβ with antisense directed at APP [<35>, <39>]. More recently, treatments thar reduce GSK have been found to improve learning and memory, and decrease oxidative stress in SAMP8 mice [<40>].We have developed an antisense oligonucleotide that targets GSK-3β to determine if disrupting the activity of GSK-3β will improve learning and memory in the SAMP8 mouse, a model of AD. We determined the antisense could improve learning and memory when administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV). At the completion of the learning and memory testing, the cortex was collected and analyzed for GSK levels and oxidative stress. Upon cellular fractionalization, we measured nuclear and cytosolic levels of Nrf2 to examine the possible effects its GSK-3β-induced inhibition may have on the increased oxidative status associated with this model of AD. Transcriptional activity of Nrf2 was assessed through analyzing the level of GST in the homogenized samples. Finally, we examined the ability of the antisense to cross the blood brain-barrier (BBB). At the start of treatment, the subjects for the experiments were 11 month old SAMP8 mice from our breeding colony. Sentinels from the facility were tested regularly to ensure our facility is virus- and pathogen- free. Food (Richland 5001) and water were available on an ad libitem basis and the rooms had a 12 hour light-dark cycle with lights on at 0600 hours. Behavioral experiments were conducted between 0730 and 1100 hours. GSK antisense oligonucleotide (GAO) [sequence: 5΄ (P=S) GGTTACCTTGCTGCCATCTT-3΄], or random antisense (RAO) (sequence: GATCACGTACACATCGACACCAGTCGCCATGACTGAGCTT) (Midland Certified Reagent Company, Midland, TX) were synthesized. Mice received 3 treatments of the respective antisenses dissolved in saline at 1 week intervals ICV. Forty-eight hours prior to training, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane, placed in a stereotaxic instrument, the scalp was deflected and a hole drilled through the skull over the injection site. The injection coordinates for the ICV injections were 0.5 mm posterior to the Bregma and 1.0 mm to the right of the sagittal suture. The injection depth was 2.0 mm. As noted, mice were injected 3 times at one week intervals. After ICV injection, the scalp was closed and the mice were returned to their cages.In this study, cortical brain regions were collected from SAMP8 mice treated with GAO (n = 9) and RAO (n = 7), the latter serving as the control. All chemicals were of the highest purity and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless stated otherwise. Nitrocellulose membranes, polyacrylamide gels, XT MES electrophoresis running buffer, and Precision Plus Protein™, and all Blue Standards were purchased from Biorad (Hercules, CA). Acquisition was tested 5 days after the third injection in an aversive T-maze. The T-maze is both a learning task based on working-memory and a reference-memory task. The T-maze consisted of a black plastic alley with a start box at one end and two goal boxes at the other."
PMC3945161_1,"The start box was separated from the alley by a plastic guillotine door that prevented movement down the alley until raised at the onset of training  An electrifiable floor of stainless steel rods ran throughout the maze to deliver a mild scrambled foot-shock.Mice were not permitted to explore the maze prior to training. A block of training trials began when a mouse was placed into the start box. The guillotine door was raised and a cue buzzer sounded simultaneously; 5 sec later foot-shock was applied. The arm of the maze entered on the first trial was designated “incorrect” and the mild foot-shock was continued until the mouse entered the other goal box, which in all subsequent trials was designated as “correct” for the particular mouse. At the end of each trial, the mouse was returned to its home cage until the next trial.Mice were trained until they made 1 avoidance. Training used an intertrial interval of 35 sec, the buzzer was of the door-bell type sounded at 55 dB, and shock was set at 0.35 mA (Coulbourn Instruments scrambled grid floor shocker model E13-08). Retention was tested one week later by continuing training until mice reached the criterion of 5 avoidances in 6 consecutive trials. The results were reported as the number of trials to criterion for the retention test. Object recognition was tested the three days following retention testing. Object-place recognition is a declarative memory task that involves the hippocampus when, as performed here, the retention interval is 24 hours after initial exposure to the objects [<41>]. Mice were habituated to an empty apparatus for 5 minutes a day for 3 days prior to entry of the objects. During the training session, the mouse was exposed to two similar objects (plastic frogs) which it was allowed to examine for 5 minutes. The apparatus and the objects were cleaned between each mouse. Twenty-four hours later, the mouse was exposed to one of the original objects and a new novel object in a new location and the percent of time spent examining the new object was recorded. The novel object was made out of the same material as the original object and of the same size, but a different shape. This eliminated to possibility of smell associated with a particular object being a factor. The underlying concept of the task is based on the tendency of mice to spend more time exploring new, novel objects than familiar objects. Thus, the greater the retention/memory at 24 hours, the more time spent with the new object. Brain samples were briefly homogenized with a Wheaton tissue homogenizer in an ice-cold lysis buffer (pH 7.4) containing 320 mM sucrose, 1% mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.098 mM MgCl2, 0.076 mM EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors leupeptin (0.5 mg/mL), pepstatin (0.7 μg/mL), aprotinin (0.5 mg/mL) and PMSF (40 μg/mL) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The homogenized samples were then diluted 2X with lysis buffer. After homogenization, a small aliquot of homogenized samples were sonicated for 10 seconds at 20% power with a Fisher 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and frozen. The remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and the supernatant cytosolic and membranous fractions were transferred out into another set of tubes. Following the addition of 400 μL of lysis buffer, the remaining pellet nuclear fraction was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 5 min and supernatant removed. The pellet was suspended in 20 μL of lysis buffer and inhibitor. The supernatant cytosolic and membranous fractions were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant cytosolic fraction was transferred out into another set of tubes leaving the pellet membranous fraction. All sonicated samples and fractions were stored at −70 °C until used for further experiments. Protein concentrations were measured through Pierce Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) method [<42>]. Protein carbonyls are an index of protein oxidation [<37>]. For protein carbonyl detection, slot blot analysis of the 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone (DNP) schiff-base adduct of the carbonyls was employed. Sample aliquots of 5 μl were incubated at room temperature with 5 μl of 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 μl of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (from OxyBlottm Protein oxidation kit, Chemicon-millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 20 min, followed by the addition of 7.5 μl of neutralization solution containing Tris (2 M) in 30% glycerol to each sample. Following derivatization samples were diluted to 1 μg/mL using 1× phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing sodium chloride, mono, and dibasic sodium phosphate. The corresponding sample solutions (250 μl) were rapidly loaded as duplicates onto a nitrocellulose membrane through water vacuum pressure. The resulting protein-bound nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked with fresh blocking solution containing 750mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 25ml of wash blot containing 35.2 g sodium chloride, 1.77 g monobasic sodium phosphate, 9.61 g dibasic sodium phosphate and 1.6 mL TWEEN, diluted to 4 L with deionized water for 90 min. The membrane was then incubated with polyclonal RbxDNP (from OxyBlottm Protein oxidation kit, Chemicon-millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, dilution 1:100) in wash blot for 2 h. After three 5 min washes with fresh wash blot, the membrane was then incubated with polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, dilution 1:8000) for 1 hour and washed with fresh wash blot in three increments of 5, 10 and 10 min. After washing, the membrane was developed colorimetrically using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium reagent solution for alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody. After development, blots were dried and scanned on a CanoScan8800F (Canon) scanner using Adobe Photoshop and analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). Protein-bound HNE is an index of lipid peroxidation [<43>]. For slot blot analysis of protein-bound HNE detection, sample aliquots of 5 μl were incubated at room temperature with 5 μl of 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 μl of Laemmli buffer for 20 min, followed by dilution to 1 μg/mL using 1× phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing sodium chloride, mono, and dibasic sodium phosphate. The corresponding sample solutions (250 μl) were rapidly loaded as duplicates onto a nitrocellulose membrane through water vacuum pressure. The resulting protein-bound nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked with fresh blocking solution for 90 min. The membrane was then incubated with polyclonal anti-HNE (Alpha diagnostic, San Antonio, TX, USA, dilution 1:5000) in wash blot for 2 h. After three 5 min washes with fresh wash blot, the membrane was then incubated with polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, dilution 1:8000) for 1 hour and washed with fresh wash blot in three increments of 5, 10 and 10 min. After washing, the membrane was developed colorimetrically using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium reagent solution for alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody. After development, blots were dried and scanned on a CanoScan8800F (Canon) scanner using Adobe Photoshop and analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The Western blot technique was used to measure protein levels of GSK-3β, Nrf2, phospho-tau, and GST. For Western blot, 30 μg or 50 μg of protein were combined with loading buffer containing 0.5 M Tris (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 20% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue and denatured in boiling water for 5 min, then cooled on ice. Sample proteins were resolved on a 4–12% bis-tris polyacrylamide gel at room temperature using a Criterion Cell™ vertical electrophoresis buffer tank filled with 1X XT MES running buffer. During the electrophoretic run, the voltage was initially set at 80 V for ~10 min, to ensure proper protein stacking, and then increased to 120 V for ~130 min. The voltage of the phospho-tau measurement was 170V for 80 min. The separated proteins from the gel were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot® Turbo™ transfer system SD semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) at 1."
PMC3945161_2,"0 A/gel for 30 min, while 80 min was applied for phospho-tau transference  The protein transfer from the gel to the membrane was checked using the reversible protein stain, ponceau S.The subsequent protein-bound membranes were incubated for 90 min in fresh blocking buffer, and then incubated for 3 h in dilutions of primary anti-GSK-3β (rabbit, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA, dilution 1:2000), anti-Nrf2 (rabbit, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA, dilution 1:1000), AT180 (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA, dilution 1:1000) and anti-GST (rabbit, Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA, dilution 1:1000) prepared in fresh wash blot. Subsequent membranes were then washed three times with fresh wash blot and incubated for 1 h in a dark room with the ECL Plex CyDye conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), Cy5 (anti-mouse) and Cy3 (anti-rabbit). Membranes were washed again with fresh wash blot three times. Bands were visualized using a fluorescent laser Typhoon™ FLA9500 (Cy5: λEX=633 nm λEM=67, Cy3: λEX=532 nm λEM=570, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) scanner and quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The membrane incubated with AT180 primary antibody for phospho-tau was subsequently incubated with anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA, dilution 1:20000) for 1 h. Bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and exposed to X-Ray film. Bands were quantified using ImageJ software. For loading control, the blots were probed with anti-β-actin (dilution 1:2000), anti-GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, dilution 1:1000) or anti-histone 2B (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, dilution 1:1000) raised in mouse, followed by incubation with anti-mouse secondary antibody (Cy3). The anti-GSK was labeled with 32-P as previously described [<44>]. Briefly, GAO anti-GSK was end-labeled by mixing 5μg of GAO with 3μl of 10× kinase buffer, 1.5μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 3μl of [γ32P] ATP. Following incubation and subsequent kinase heat-inactivation, the labeled 32-P- GAO (P-GAO) was removed from the reaction mixture by ethanol precipitation followed by centrifugation. The pellet containing the P- GAO went through three cycles of washing with ethanol and centrifugation, and then the pellet was air dried in a vacuum centrifuge and re-suspended in 100μl water. Male CD-1 mice 4 months of age were anesthetized with an ip injection of 0.2ml urethane. The jugular vein and carotid artery were exposed. Each mouse was given a 0.2ml injection into the jugular vein of saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin(S-BSA) and 3 × 105 CPM P-GAO. At time points of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, or 120 min post-injection, carotid arterial blood was collected, the mouse immediately decapitated and the brain removed and weighed. Arterial blood was centrifuged and 3600 rpm for 15 min and the serum was collected. The level of radioactivity in serum and brain was determined with a scintillation counter. The rate of clearance of P-GAO P-GSK from the serum was determined by expressing the results as the percent of the injected dose in each milliliter of serum (%Inj/ml) and plotting these values against time (min). The %Inj/ml was determined by the equation: %Inj/ml = (CPM/ml serum)/(mean CPM/injection)100. Male CD-1 mice 4 months of age were anesthetized with an ip injection of 0.2ml urethane. The jugular vein and carotid artery were exposed. Each mouse was given a 0.2ml injection into the jugular vein of saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin(S-BSA) and 3 × 105 CPM P-GAO.

The rate of clearance of P-GAO P-GSK from the serum was determined by expressing the results as the percent of the injected dose in each milliliter of serum (%Inj/ml) and plotting these values against time (min). The %Inj/ml was determined by the equation: Multiple-time regression analysis was used to determine the rate of uptake from blood to brain for P- GAO. The brain/serum ratios (B/S) were calculated for each time point ranging from 1 to 120min after iv injection of P- GAO for the extended curve (n=1/time point) and 1 to 20 min after iv injection for the short curve (n=1–2/time point). These ratios were plotted against their respective exposure times (Expt). From this graph, the slope of the linear portion of the line represents the unidirectional influx rate (Ki) and the y-intercept represents the initial volume of distribution (Vi). The B/S was calculated using the formula: B/S = (Brain CPM/g of brain)/(serum CPM/ μl of serum).

These ratios were plotted against their respective exposure times (Expt). From this graph, the slope of the linear portion of the line represents the unidirectional influx rate (Ki) and the y-intercept represents the initial volume of distribution (Vi).

The procedure has been previously described [<45>]. Mice (n=7) were anesthetized with 40% urethane and then received and iv injection of 1 × 106 CPM of P-GAO in 0.2ml S- BSA into the jugular vein. Ten minutes post-injection the abdomen was opened and blood collected from the abdominal aorta. The thorax was then opened through a midline sternal incision, the descending aorta clamped, both jugular veins severed and washout of the vascular space was performed by injecting 20ml of saline into the left ventricle of the heart over a 1 min period. This procedure washed out the vascular space of the brain, by removing any substances that were intravascular or loosely adhered to the capillary lumen of the brain microvasculature. The brain was then removed and placed in a glass homogenizer containing 0.8ml of physiologic buffer. After 10 strokes with the pestle, 1.6ml of the physiologic buffer containing 26% dextran was added to the homogenate. The homogenate was homogenized a second time (3 strokes).

Results from the GSK and oxidative stress measurements were compared by the Mann-Whitney test using Prism 5.0 statistical package software to assess statistical significance in comparing protein carbonyl, protein-bound HNE, GSK-3β, Nrf2 and GST levels in protein samples between control and experimental data sets. Significant differences were set at P < 0.05. Seventy-two hours after GAO treatment mice were tested in T-maze foot shock avoidance acquisition. One week later, the mice were tested for retention. The t-test for trial to first avoidance during acquisition in the T-maze showed a significant effect t(15)=2.092, P<0.05. The mice that received GAO took significantly fewer trials to reach their first avoidance (8.75±1.22) than the mice that received random antisense (11.67±0.745) (<Figure 1A>). The t-test for trials to criterion on the retention test showed a significant effect t(14)=2.945, P<0.01 (<Figure 1B>). The mice that received GAO (6.714 ± 0.42) took significantly fewer trials to reach criterion than the mice that received RAO (12.89±1.806).The t-test for time exploring the novel object during the 24 hour retention test was significant t(15)=2.373, P<0.03. The mice that received GAO (59.33±5.16) spent a significantly greater amount of time exploring the novel object than the mice that received random antisense (44.75±2.93) (<Figure 1C>). Immunochemical methods were used to determine if the antisense treatment successfully decreased the level of GSK-3β in SAMP8 mice compared to the control. GSK-3β was successfully down regulated in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions by the antisense treatment (<Figures 2A-B>). Immunoblot analysis of the GSK-3β levels in aliquots of nuclear (30 μl) and cytosolic (50 μl) fractions indicate a significant decrease of 36.9% (P<0.04) and 16.9% (P<0.05), respectively, from SAMP8 GAO mice compared to the control. Sensitive immunochemical methods were used to determine if suppression of GSK-3β in SAMP8 mice had any effect on protein carbonyl levels. The results indicate a decrease in brain protein oxidation as a result of the suppressed GSK-3β level in SAMP8 mice. Immunoblot analysis of homogenized brain samples indicates a significant 26.3 percent decrease (P<0.02) in the protein carbonyl level from SAMP8 GAO mice compared to the control (<Figure 3A>). Our results indicate a decreased lipid peroxidation as a result of the suppressed GSK-3β level in SAMP8 mice brain. Immunoblot analysis of homogenized samples show a significant 20.3 percent decrease (P<0.0008) in SAMP8 GAO mice compared to the control (<Figure 3B>). To determine if the suppression of GSK-3β in SAMP8 mice had an effect on the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, nuclear and cytosolic levels of this redox sensitive transcription factor were measured. Nrf2 band intensities of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions were normalized to histone-2B and β-actin, respectively, each serving as a loading control. Our results suggest a possible increase in the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nucleus as a result of the suppressed GSK-3β level in SAMP8 mice. Immunoblot analysis of the Nrf2 levels in aliquots of nuclear and cytosolic fractions indicate a significant 69.4 percent increase (P<0.04) and 29.5 percent increase (P<0.02), respectively, from SAMP8 GAO mice compared to the control (<Figure 4A-B>). GST is one of several antioxidant enzymes up-regulated by Nrf2 transcriptional activity. As a means of determining Nrf2 transcriptional activity, the level of GST was measured. GST band intensities of the homogenized samples were normalized to β-actin, a loading control. Our results suggest a possible increase in Nrf2 transcriptional activity as a result of the suppressed GSK-3β level in SAMP8 mice. Immunoblot analysis of the GST level in 30 μl aliquots of protein sample show a significant 31.5 percent increase (P<0.03), from SAMP8 GAO mice compared to the control (<Figure 5>). Given that: (1) GSK-3β is a kinase for tau; (2) tau hyperphosphorylation is highly detrimental to neurons; and (3) GAO treatment led to improved learning and memory in SAMP8 mice (<Fig. 1>), we tested the hypothesis that GAO treatment would result in lower levels of phospho-tau in brain of SAMP8 mice compared to brain from RAO-treated SAMP8 mice. <Figure 6> shows that this hypothesis was confirmed (p<0.01). The %Inj/ml demonstrated that there was an early decline of P- GAO from serum. Serum levels reached a steady state by 30 min after IV injection. The early distribution phase of clearance from serum was linear out to 20 min, with a significant correlation between log[%Inj/ml] and time. The half-time disappearance rate from serum was −7.47min (r=0.9205, p<0.0001). The linear relation between the brain/serum ratios (B/S) and exposure time (Expt) during the first 20 min demonstrated P- GAO influx into the brain. The unidirectional rate of influx (Ki) from blood to brain was 0.2108±0.0523 μl/g-min (r=0.7722, p=0.0020). The volume of distribution at time zero (Vi) was 6.78±0.816 μl/g. When plotted against time, the percentage of the iv injected dose of P- GAO taken up by the brain was 0.033%Inj/g at 20 min post-injection. Capillary depletion studies produced a mean brain parenchyma/serum ratio of 6.956±0.995ul/g and a mean capillary/serum ration of 1.183±0.163ul/g. The parenchyma/serum ratio was almost 6 times greater than the capillary/serum ratio indicating the P- GAO completely crossed the BBB to enter the brain parenchymal space (<Figure 7>). The regulatory kinase GSK-3β has been implicated in AD through its various contributions including hyperphosphorylated tau formation and neurodegeneration [<6>, <9>, <22>, <23>, <46>]. High levels of GSK-3β have been reported in AD brain, further supporting a connection between the kinase and the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease that remains to be elucidated [<47>, <48>]. In this current study, we examined the possible effects GSK-3β may have on cognitive deficits and brain oxidative stress observed in a mouse model of AD through the antisense-mediated suppression of the kinase in SAMP8 mice.The SAMP8 mice used in this study were treated with antisense oligonucleotide directed at GSK-3β and random antisense oligonucleotide, the latter serving as the control."
PMC3945161_4,"The GSK-3β antisense had a sequence that corresponds to 94–113 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon of GSK-mRNA  This is an internal sequence with high probability of being located away from any loop formation in the mRNA. As an internal site, it should not block 100% of GSK mRNA. This is important as GSK-3 is essential for intracellular signaling pathways such as cell proliferation, cellular migration, glucose regulation, inflammatory responses and apoptosis [<49>]. Analysis of cortical tissue showed a suppression of GSK-3β, indicating the success of the administered antisense treatment directed at the kinase.ICV administration of GAO improved learning and memory in T-maze foot shock avoidance and object recognition in the SAMP8 mouse model of AD, consonant with the notion that this kinase is implicated in the cognitive deficits associated with the disorder. This improved learning and memory was associated with decreased markers of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation (protein carbonyls and protein-bound HNE, respectively) in brain and was associated with decreased phosphorylation of tau. We measured the levels of protein carbonyl and protein-bound HNE, parameters of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, respectively. Both protein carbonyl and protein-bound HNE significantly decreased in brain of GAO treated SAMP8 mice compared to the control, consistent with the notion that this kinase plays a role in the elevated oxidative status characteristic of AD brain. The observed reduction in oxidative stress may be a consequence of the increased antioxidant transcriptional activity of Nrf2, resulting from its decreased inhibition by GSK-3β.The neuroprotective transcription factor Nrf2 is one of the many proteins negatively regulated by the activity of GSK-3β and this transcription factor plays an important role in the cellular defense against oxidative stress through inducing the expression of antioxidant phase II genes, including, among others, heme oxygenase-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase, and glutathione S-transferase [<24>, <50>, <51>]. To determine if the suppression of GSK-3β in SAMP8 led to the nuclear re-localization of Nrf2, we measured the nuclear and cytosolic levels of this transcription factor. Significantly increased nuclear and decreased cytosolic Nrf2 levels measured supports the increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor. As a means of determining increased transcriptional activity, we measured the level of GST, which is an antioxidant enzyme up-regulated by Nrf2, responsible for the conjugation of HNE to glutathione for export from the brain. The level of GST significantly increased in SAMP8 GAO mice compared to the control, in agreement with the observed decrease in protein-bound HNE, suggesting the increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2. These results support the idea that the activity of GSK-3β, and its associated inhibition of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant transcription, play major roles in the loss of tolerance to an oxidative environment observed in AD. As mentioned, GAO had a neuroprotective effect of reducing phosphorylation of tau compared to treatment with RAO (<Fig. 6>). Elevated tau phosphorylation is a cardinal hallmark of AD pathology and neurodegeneration. If the activity of GSK-3β does play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD, then inhibitors of the kinase may be an effective therapeutic treatment of the disorder.Given the critical cellular functions of GSK-3β, antisense treatment may be an effective way to control the over-activity of the kinase without completely blocking its functions. Currently, there is increasing interest in the use of antisenses for the treatment of diseases. Working through the Watson-Crick mechanism, antisenses bind to and induce the cleavage of homologous stretches of mRNA sequences resulting in the targeted destruction of mRNA [<52>]. Antisenses are currently in various stages of testing for such conditions as cancer, hypercholesterolemia, Ebola virus infection, type 2 diabetes, HIV infection and ocular disease, and may be a feasible treatment for AD as well [<52>, <53>].Although the behavioral and oxidative stress studies presented here followed ICV treatment with GAO or RAO, we investigated the possibility of peripherally administered GAO crossing the BBB, a prerequisite to development of an effective therapy. By examining influx of GAO at the blood-brain barrier, we were able to show that peripherally injected GSK antisense crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the CNS. These findings with GAO are similar to the findings of an antisense we previously developed directed at the C-terminal portion of the APP peptide (OL-1). We found that administration of OL-1 improved learning and memory, decreased oxidative stress and crossed the BBB [<54>–<57>]. Based on our previous results with APP antisense and our results here with GSK antisense, AD is an additional condition for which antisense likely would be an effective treatment. The current findings in this study suggest that peripheral administration of GAO is feasible and may improve learning and memory and reverse oxidative stress in AD brain.In conclusion, this paper provides evidence that the inhibition of GSK-3β with antisense improves cognition and indices of oxidative stress in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, the reduction in Nrf2 provides an additional potential mechanism through which GSK-3β over-activity contributes to the oxidative damage associated with AD. The ability of GAO to cross the BBB suggests that peripheral administration is possible and that GAO should be investigated further as a potential treatment for AD. rhetorical Figure 1 Antisense oligonucleotide treatment led to improved cognition in 12 month old SAMP8 mice compared to SAMP8 mice treated with random antisense oligonucleotide.

Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3β is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including the heightened levels of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurodegeneration. In this study we used 12 month old SAMP8 mice, an AD model, to examine the effects GSK-3β may cause regarding the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress associated with AD. To suppress the level of GSK-3β, SAMP8 mice were treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (GAO) directed at this kinase. We measured a decreased level of GSK-3β in the cortex of the mice, indicating the success of the antisense treatment. Learning and memory assessments of the SAMP8 mice were tested post-antisense treatment using an aversive T-maze and object recognition test, both of which observably improved. In cortex samples of the SAMP8 mice, decreased levels of protein carbonyl and protein-bound HNE were measured indicating decreased oxidative stress. Nuclear factor erythroid -2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor known to increase the level of many antioxidants, including glutathione-S transferase (GST), and is negatively regulated by the activity of GSK-3β. Our results indicated the increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 and level of GST, suggesting the increased activity of the transcription factor as a result of GSK-3β suppression, consistent with the decreased oxidative stress observed. Consistent with the improved learning and memory, and consistent with GSK-3b being a tau kinase, we observed decreased tau phosphorylation in brain of GAO-treated SAMP8 mice compared to that of RAO-treated SAMP8 mice. Lastly, we examined the ability of GAO to cross the blood-brain barrier and determined it to be possible. The results presented in this study demonstrate that reducing GSK-3 with a phosphorothionated antisense against GSK-3 improves learning and memory, reduces oxidative stress, possibly coincident with increased levels of the antioxidant transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and decreases tau phosphorylation. Our study supports the notion of GAO as a possible treatment for AD. ."
PMC5822466_0,"Autism is a prevailing neurodevelopmental disorder with a large genetic/genomic component. Recently, the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 A (DYRK1A) gene was implicated as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We identified five DYRK1A variants in ASD patients and found that the dose of DYRK1A protein has a crucial role in various aspects of postnatal neural development. Dyrk1a loss of function and gain of function led to defects in dendritic growth, dendritic spine development and radial migration during cortical development. Importantly, two autism-associated truncations, R205X and E239X, were shown to be Dyrk1a loss-of-function mutants. Studies of the truncated Dyrk1a mutants may provide new insights into the role of Dyrk1a in brain development, as well as the role of Dyrk1a loss of function in the pathophysiology of autism.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder<1> with multiple different etiologies. The heritability of ASD has been estimated to be as high as 90%.<2> ASD is usually diagnosed by clinical assessment and the onset of three core disturbances before 3 years of age: impaired social interaction, unusual patterns of highly restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and language abnormalities.<2> The risk of recurrence for ASD is approximately 2–3%.<3>Autism is thought to occur when an array of potential genetic vulnerabilities, possibly in concert with epigenetic factors and/or gene–environment interactions, affect neural connectivity and neurodevelopment.<4> To date, we have learned that the symptoms of autism may arise when some specific region of the genome appears to be abnormal; for instance, multiple genetic/genomic factors have been reported to be associated with autism, including chromosomal abnormalities, genomic copy number variants and genetic variants of specific genes.<5>, <6>, <7>, <8>Dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), which is encoded by a gene on human chromosome 21, is involved in many of the biological processes of neural development and performs critical functions by phosphorylating various downstream substrates, including transcription factors, splice factors and synaptic proteins.<9> For example, DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of the P53 protein at Ser15 inhibits cell proliferation and is therefore associated with cell growth and differentiation.<10> The tau protein and the N-WASP protein affect the outgrowth of microscopic fibers and actin assembly when they are phosphorylated by DYRK1A and thereby contribute to the development of neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines.<11>, <12>, <13> Considering the critical contribution of DYRK1A to Down syndrome (DS),<14> numerous studies have focused on the Dyrk1a gain-of-function model, in which transgenic mice that overexpress Dyrk1a by 1.5-fold show severe learning and memory defects.<15>, <16>, <17> The dosage imbalance of Dyrk1a led to delayed neural development.<18>, <19>, <20> Previous studies have identified the molecular mechanisms by which DYRK1A affects the occurrence of DS and mental retardation.<9>, <15>, <21>, <22>, <23> In several recent exome sequencing studies of ASD patients, some DYRK1A variants were found to be associated with autism, suggesting that DYRK1A is another risk factor for ASD.<6>, <24>, <25>, <26>In an exome sequencing pilot study, we identified several DYRK1A mutations in ASD patients with intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD) (short name ASD/ID/DD or ASD), consistent with the findings of other independent studies.<27> Furthermore, we screened 892 patients with ASD/ID/DD and/or epilepsy/seizure for the DYRK1A gene and found additional variants of DYRK1A (<Supplementary Table S1>). Using this sequencing approach, a total of 11 novel variants and 1 known mutation in the coding region were detected, of which 9 variants were predicted to alter protein function according to bioinformatics prediction (<Table 1>), whereas the other 3 variants were benign. Given the locations of the DYRK1A variants in the specific protein domains, we postulate that those variants may affect DYRK1A function in three ways: nuclear localization, kinase activity, and abnormal translation termination that results in truncated DYRK1A proteins (<Table 1> and <Figure 1c>). Previous reports have suggested that the R205X mutant acts in the third way.<28>, <29> Owing to the critical role of Dyrk1a in neural development, we decided to investigate the role of Dyrk1a in neural development, as well as whether these Dyrk1a variants have loss- or gain-of-function effects. Previously, we collaboratively screened 892 patients at Boston Children’s Hospital (437 samples of the western population) and the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University (455 samples of Han Chinese) with ASD/ID/DD for DYRK1A. All samples were de-identified prior to collection under Institutional Review Board protocols for non-identifiable biological specimens, which were deemed ‘leftover’ from patient samples after clinical tests. Of these, we selected samples with an ASD/ID/DD and/or epilepsy/seizure diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. This study was approved by each institute. The sequencing experiments were also performed at each institute. For the bioinformatics analysis of the DYRK1A variants identified in the screen, the longest of DYRK1A isoform was used as a reference sequence (NM_001396.3, NP_001387.2). Considering the high homology between human and mouse Dyrk1a, we introduced the mouse Dyrk1a cDNA (NM_007890.2, NP_031916.1) into our study, and the DYRK1A variants in the coding region that were identified in individuals with ASD corresponded to Dyrk1a (<Supplementary Table S2>). Variants were classified according to DYRK1A protein domains listed in UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/).<Supplementary Table S1> lists the variants detected in these patients. Based on the classification of the 11 variants, we selected 5 representative variants (three missense: H119Y, A195T and L259F; and two nonsense: R205X and E239X), which covered all three kinds of variants described previously, to investigate the role of DYRK1A in neurodevelopment, as well as the effects of these variants on the DYRK1A protein (<Figure 1c>)."
PMC5822466_1,"Considering that DYRK1A is highly conserved between human and mouse (approximately 99% according to protein sequence alignment using the MegAlign software; <Supplementary Figure S1>), we used the cDNA of mouse Dyrk1a rather than of human DYRK1A  The five variants were located in the mouse Dyrk1a cDNA, which corresponded to DYRK1A (<Supplementary Table S2>). The patient with R205X was diagnosed with ID and global DD. She exhibited microcephaly, chronic static encephalopathy and aphasia, oral motor apraxia, seizure dysmorphism and anxiety. All test results for karyotyping, fragile X and chromosomal microarray analysis were negative. The patient with E239X was diagnosed with ASD and global DD. He had a history of autism, anxiety and developmental coordination disorder, as well as abnormal electroencephalography but no seizures. Tests results for karyotyping, fragile X and chromosomal microarray analysis were negative. The patient with H119Y was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified). She had a history of global DD that was most marked for speech delay, motor delay and motor coordination disorder, seizure and mild physical dysmorphology. Tests results for karyotyping, fragile X and chromosomal microarray analysis were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were normal. The patient with A195T was diagnosed with ASD/ID. He had a history of infantile spasms and global DD, with particular impairments in language, social interaction and repetitive behaviors, mild ID, complex partial epilepsy with epileptic encephalopathy and anxiety. Tests results for karyotyping, fragile X and chromosomal microarray analysis were negative. The patient with L259F was diagnosed with PDD-NOS and then ASD/ID. He demonstrated extremely low cognitive abilities and adaptive functioning, consistent with the mild range of ID. He had anxiety, perseveration and additional upsets and aggressive behavior. Because the parents of the patients were not available for testing, no other genetic information was available. The full-length Dyrk1a ORF was amplified from the total cDNA of mouse cortical neurons. Dyrk1a was then inserted into pRK5-Myc, which already contained a 1xMyc epitope tag (5′-EQKLISEEDL-3′) at the 5′ end. For immunofluorescence experiments, we cloned Myc-Dyrk1a into pCAGGS-IRES-green fluorescent protein (GFP). The mutants, including both missense mutations and the two truncations, were generated using KOD-Plus, and specific primers were designed (<Supplementary Table S3>) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (#132000; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The mouse Dyrk1a shRNA was directed against the following sequence, 5′-AGAAGACGATGCATACAGG-3′, which was introduced into the pSUPER vector.Lentivirus was provided by BrainVTA (Wuhan, China). The antibodies used in this study included the following: DYRK1A (no. 2771; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); GAPDH (no. ab8245; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); Myc epitope tag (no. M20002; Abmart, Berkeley Heights, NJ, USA); GFP (no. G10362; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and SMI 312 (no. SMI-312R; COVANCE, Princeton, NJ, USA). Embryonic day 15 (E15)–E16 mouse cortical neurons were cultured and transfected via electroporation with an Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) at 0 days in vitro (DIV) on cover glasses that had been coated with a poly-D-lysine solution (1 mg ml−1 in dd water) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After DIV 3, the cells were fixed for further analysis.For neurite and axon outgrowth rescue experiments, we co-transfected each group with two plasmids, using a 1:1 ratio of wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of Dyrk1a and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), via electroporation as described above. Cells were collected for immunofluorescence analysis after 72 h of in vitro culturing. Cells were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min and blocked in 1 × PBS buffer with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 60 min at room temperature (RT). The cells were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed three times in 1 × PBS and then incubated in secondary antibodies at RT for 90–120 min. The signals were observed via fluorescence microscopy. For Dyrk1a-specific expression in the mouse cortex, cortical tissue homogenates were prepared from the mouse brains at different developmental stages, immersed in RIPA buffer, boiled in 1 × sodium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer and then resolved by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All of the protein on the gel was transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) buffer for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed three times in TBST and incubated in secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. The signals were revealed by horseradish peroxidase reaction using SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Postnatal day 5 (P5) Sprague Dawley rats were included in the spine density study. Hippocampal tissue slices (400 μm) were cultured on Millicell (0.4 μm; Millipore, Boston, MA, USA) in six-well plates with 1 ml of slice culture medium as described previously.<30>, <31> The cultured slices were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected using a Helios Gene Gun (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at DIV 2. Bullets were prepared containing 50 μg of plasmid DNA coated on 25 mg of 1.0-μm gold particles (Bio-Rad). The medium was changed every 2 days. The slices were fixed at DIV 7 in ice-cold 4% PFA. GFP immunostaining was then conducted using a GFP antibody and an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000). DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 1:500) was also used to visualize cell nuclei. Plasmids encoding WT Dyrk1a, R205X and the empty vector were prepared in a final volume of 15 μl (2 μg μl−1 plasmid DNA, 0.01% Fast Green and 0.5 μg μl−1 enhanced GFP) for each pregnant mouse. The plasmids were then injected into the ventricles of E14.5 mouse brains. Electroporation (50-ms square pulses at 1000-ms intervals) was performed using an Electro Square Porator (ECM 830, San Diego, CA, USA) at 30 V.Mouse pups were harvested at P0, and whole brains were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and sequentially dehydrated in 15% and 30% sucrose solutions (in 1 × PBS) for >48 h. Longitudinal brain sections (30 μm) were obtained via frozen sectioning for later immunofluorescence experiments in which GFP immunostaining was performed using a GFP antibody and an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) to recognize GFP-positive neurons. Images were obtained using a Nikon E80i fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a × 20 objective (for neurite development, axonal polarity formation and subcellular localization in cultured mouse cortical neurons), a Nikon E80i equipped with a × 10 objective (for cortical migration and in utero electroporation (IUE)), a Nikon A1 confocal microscope equipped with a × 20 objective (for neurite outgrowth in rat hippocampal slice cultures and the IUE examples) and a Nikon A1 confocal microscope equipped with a × 60 oil immersion lens (for spine density).To evaluate neurite length in cultured primary cortical neurons, GFP-positive cells were randomly selected from each condition, and the total neurite length was traced with the Fiji software (http://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads). At least three independent experiments were performed, and approximately 70 neurons were analyzed.To evaluate spine density in rat hippocampal slice cultures, images were obtained as a Z-stack of approximately 15–20 sections (0.2 μm per section). The average spine density of specific neurons was analyzed statistically and compared among the four treatments. The average spine density was calculated as the total number of spines per 10 μm of dendritic length of each neuron. Approximately 45 neurons from 3 independent experiments were evaluated."

The ratio of GFP-positive cells in the cortical plate included the total number of GFP-positive cells in the intermediate zone, the subventricular zone and the ventricular zone and was analyzed for each condition.All statistical analyses were conducted using unpaired t-tests, with P<0.05 considered significant. Dyrk1a is widely expressed in the developing nervous system,<10>, <32> suggesting that it has a crucial role in brain development. To examine DYRK1A protein levels in the embryonic and postnatal cortex, we collected protein lysates from embryonic and early postnatal mouse brains and examined DYRK1A protein levels via western blotting. We found that Dyrk1a was highly expressed during the embryonic stage, from E16 to P0, and this high expression level persisted until P7 (<Figure 1a>). In contrast, DYRK1A protein expression gradually decreased from P7 and remained at a relatively low level thereafter (<Figure 1a>). This expression pattern suggests that Dyrk1a has a critical role in the developing brain. To study the role of Dyrk1a in neural development, we designed a series of shRNAs against the mouse Dyrk1a gene and identified one set of effective shRNAs that significantly decreased DYRK1A protein levels in mouse primary cortical neurons (<Figure 1b>). Dendrites have a vital role in the biological functions of neurons, such as the receipt of information from other neurons. Previous studies have observed dendritic abnormalities in the brains of DS patients; in these patients, the DYRK1A gene is overexpressed owing to the excess of chromosome 21-associated genes.<15>, <18> Furthermore, Lepagnol-Bestel et al.<21> showed that overexpressing Dyrk1a in mouse cortical neurons significantly decreased neurite length. Thus we decided to investigate whether autism-associated Dyrk1a mutations are involved in neurite development.During our analysis of DYRK1A variants, we classified the nine variants into three groups according to their specific localization in the functional domains of DYRK1A (<Figure 1c>), as described above, and decided to select five representative mutants (R205X, E239X, H119Y, A195T and L259F) for further analysis.In this study, we transfected mouse primary cortical neurons with plasmids expressing the empty CAG vector (as a control), Dyrk1a shRNA, WT Dyrk1a and the five Dyrk1a mutants, and we measured total neuritic and axonal length after 72 h. First, we confirmed a previous finding that overexpression of WT Dyrk1a severely reduced the total neurite length in cultured mouse cortical neurons (<Figures 1d–f>). Importantly, when endogenous Dyrk1a was specifically knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi), neurite length was also significantly decreased compared with control neurons expressing GFP alone. This finding was similar to the observation that overexpressing WT Dyrk1a decreased neurite growth (<Figures 1d–f>). These data indicate that the precise dosage of DYRK1A protein is critical for proper neurite development.We further examined whether mutations in Dyrk1a affected neurite growth. We found that overexpressing either of the two Dyrk1a truncation mutants (R205X and E239X) did not inhibit total neurite growth; neurite growth in cells that were transfected with these mutants resembled that of controls, indicating that these two mutants lacked the normal function of WT Dyrk1a (<Figures 1d–e>). However, all three Dyrk1a missense mutants (H119Y, A195T and L259F) retained the ability to repress neurite outgrowth when overexpressed (<Figures 1d–e>), similar to WT Dyrk1a, indicating that non-haploinsufficient mutations may affect different aspects of brain development.We next investigated whether Dyrk1a might affect axonal growth in neurons. During the neurite development assay, we measured axon length via immunohistochemistry using an antibody against the axonal marker SIM 312 and found that axonal growth was indeed affected by the Dyrk1a dosage and autism-associated mutations (<Figures 1d and f>). From these results, we found that shRNA-mediated Dyrk1a knockdown, as well as the overexpression of the WT form and the three missense mutants, decreased axon length compared with the control. In contrast, R205X- and E239X-expressing neurons exhibited the same phenotype as CAG vector-expressing neurons (<Figures 1d and f>).Because WT Dyrk1a overexpression led to a similar phenotype to that of shRNA-mediated Dyrk1a knockdown, we performed a rescue experiment to confirm the specificity of the shRNA-mediated Dyrk1a knockdown and acquire a better understanding of the critical impact of the Dyrk1a dosage on neurite and axonal development. WT Dyrk1a rescued the inhibition of both neurite and axon length caused by Dyrk1a RNAi (<Figures 2a–c>). Neurons co-expressing WT Dyrk1a and shRNA exhibited similar outgrowth as control neurons expressing GFP alone, confirming the specificity of the Dyrk1a shRNA in mouse cortical neurons.Moreover, we previously showed that overexpression of nonsense mutations did not mimic the phenotype of WT Dyrk1a overexpression on neurite and axonal growth, revealing the important effect of these two Dyrk1a truncations. For further insight into the function of these mutants, we also conducted a rescue experiment using the five mutant forms of Dyrk1a and found that only the three missense mutations could rescue the knockdown phenotype (<Figures 2a–c>). The two truncations, R205X and E239X, did not restore neurite and axon lengths to control levels. In fact, staining revealed decreased outgrowth, similar to that observed with Dyrk1a RNAi (<Figures 2a–c>). Therefore, we surmise that these two Dyrk1a truncations act as Dyrk1a loss-of-function mutants.We conclude that the Dyrk1a dosage is critical for proper neurite and axonal outgrowth and that the two nonsense mutations, R205X and E239X, are loss-of-function mutants. Next we wanted to examine the role of Dyrk1a in spine formation in hippocampal neurons. Dendritic spines are small protrusions along dendrites and represent the typical postsynaptic structure of excitatory synapses. Studies have shown that dendritic spine abnormalities are strongly associated with various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.<33>
Dyrk1a is reported to phosphorylate and inactivate the N-WASP protein, suggesting that Dyrk1a has a role in spine formation.<12>We investigated the role of Dyrk1a in spine formation using a hippocampal slice culture system. We used gene-gun-mediated delivery to introduce plasmids encoding GFP along with WT Dyrk1a, Dyrk1a R205X and Dyrk1a shRNA into hippocampal neurons in postnatal hippocampal slices. Interestingly, we found that either knocking down Dyrk1a or overexpressing the WT form strongly repressed dendritic spine formation in hippocampal neurons, further indicating that a precise amount of DYRK1A protein is required for proper spine development (<Figures 3a and b>). However, overexpression of the R205X mutant did not similarly inhibit dendritic growth (<Figures 3a and b>).Furthermore, we conducted rescue assays to confirm the critical role of Dyrk1a in spine formation. WT Dyrk1a successfully rescued the loss of function, and neurons that received this treatment exhibited phenotypes similar to those of neurons that only expressed the CAG vector (<Figures 3c and d>). Therefore, we concluded that the shRNA against Dyrk1a was specific in rat hippocampal neuron. The three missense mutations also rescued the decreased spine density caused by Dyrk1a RNAi, whereas the two truncation mutants, R205X and E239X, did not rescue the effects on spine formation (<Figures 3c and d>), consistent with the rescue phenotype that was observed in mouse cortical neurons."
PMC5822466_3,"We also measured neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons that received the aforementioned manipulations  Consistently, either RNAi or WT Dyrk1a overexpression strongly inhibited neurite growth in hippocampal neurons in brain slices (<Figures 4a and b>). However, overexpression of the Dyrk1a R205X mutant did not affect neurite growth compared with WT Dyrk1a (<Figures 4a and b>). We next re-expressed WT and different Dyrk1a mutants along with RNAi in hippocampal slice cultures to assess whether these defects could be rescued. Only WT Dyrk1a and the missense mutants, but not R205X and E239X, were able to rescue the defects caused by RNAi (<Figures 4c and d>). The rescue results further confirmed the role of Dyrk1a in neurite development in hippocampal slices and that the truncations resulted in Dyrk1a loss of function. This evidence again indicates that the autism-related Dyrk1a truncations (R205X and E239X) are loss-of-function mutations. To further understand the role of Dyrk1a in embryonic and postnatal cortical development in the mouse brain, we examined cortical migration by manipulating Dyrk1a via IUE in mice.Plasmids encoding GFP plus either the WT Dyrk1a or the R205X mutant were electroporated into the ventricular zone of E14.5 mouse brains, and the migration status of the GFP-labeled neurons was observed in neonatal pups on P0. Overexpression of WT Dyrk1a significantly delayed cortical migration compared with GFP expression alone (<Figures 5a and b>). In contrast, expressing the Dyrk1a R205X truncation in migrating neurons did not similarly affect cortical migration, again suggesting that the R205X truncation has a loss-of-function effect (<Figures 5a and b>). This evidence again indicates that the R205X truncation may be a loss-of-function mutant of Dyrk1a, which affects various aspects of postnatal neural development, including dendrite and spine formation and cortical migration. The histidine-repeat domain near the C-terminus of DYRK1A is critical for its localization in nuclear speckles.<34> Therefore, we wanted to examine whether the R205X or E239X truncation affected the subcellular localization of Dyrk1a in neurons. We transfected cultured mouse primary cortical neurons with plasmids encoding myc-tagged WT Dyrk1a or the two truncated mutants. By performing immunocytochemistry with an anti-myc antibody, we first confirmed that WT Dyrk1a was expressed exclusively in the nucleus (<Figure 6>). Importantly, the R205X and E239X Dyrk1a truncations were also located in the nucleus, suggesting that these mutations did not affect Dyrk1a localization (<Figure 6>). DYRK1A is a critical gene located on human chromosome 21, encoding a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that has been reported to phosphorylate several substrates related to gene transcription, neuronal degeneration and synapse function.<9>
Dyrk1a transgenic mice (TgDyrk1A), a mouse model of DS that overexpresses Dyrk1a by 1.5-fold,<19> show defects in learning and memory, as well as hyperactivity and altered motor learning.<22> Duplications of Dyrk1a result in abnormal neural development, such as compromised dendrite outgrowth and cell differentiation. At early embryonic stages, Dyrk1a overexpression reduces the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells,<35>, <36>, <37>, <38>, <39>, <40> whereas increasing neuronal differentiation and enhancing GABAergic differentiation, which were observed in neuronal stem cells isolated from TgDyrk1A mice.For decades, different types of genetic/genomic defects have been linked to ASD, including chromosomal abnormalities, genomic copy number variants and genetic variants of hundreds genes, highlighting the etiological heterogeneity underlying the genetic and phenotypic variation in ASD. Recently, DYRK1A was proposed as a candidate gene for syndromic ASD and ID or DD, and approximately 100 alterations have thus far been identified. Of these, the majority are de novo heterozygous mutations (nonsense, frame-shift, splicing alteration) and large chromosomal rearrangements (micro-deletion/duplication, insertion and translocation). The majority were haploinsufficiency alterations, which are relevant for many ASD-associated genes. The eight novel and one recurrent DYRK1A mutations detected in our patients with ASD/ID/DD are consistent with these findings.<6>, <8>, <24>, <25>, <26>, <41>, <42>, <43>, <44>In the present study, the phenotypes of the two patients with DYRK1A truncations partially overlapped with the findings in a recent report, including microcephaly, seizures and impaired speech, supporting the hypothesis that DYRK1A truncations define a syndromic form of ASD and ID.<26> Interestingly, the higher incidence of truncations identified in our patients (0.22% 2 truncations in 892 patients) is similar to work by van Bon et al.<26> (0.21% 15 truncations in 7162 patients), further supporting the observation that DYRK1A truncations may be a relatively common type of mutation associated with syndromic ASD and ID or DD.Fewer than 10 missense mutations have been reported in the literature, and most are predicted to be pathogenic; however, no functional studies have been described. In the present study, we found that the three missense mutations behaved similarly to WT Dyrk1a when overexpressed, with all three repressing neurite and axon outgrowth and affecting spine development; however, all could be rescued, which indicated that they were not loss-of-function mutations but may affect other Dyrk1a functions that were not assessed in this study. These findings also suggested that non-haploinsufficient missense mutations may affect brain development in different ways than haploinsufficient truncated mutations. Further studies to explore the pathogenesis of such missense mutations are needed. In addition, this study was limited to detecting only DYRK1A mutations; therefore, these missense mutations may in fact function with other unknown mutations or may not contribute to the risk of autism.In this study, we show that Dyrk1a has an important role in neural development. The imbalance of the Dyrk1a dosage affected dendrite development and axon length. Consistent results were found in primary cultured mouse cortical neuron and rat hippocampal slice cultures. We also found that the two Dyrk1a nonsense truncations were unable to rescue defects caused by Dyrk1a knockdown. Therefore, we conclude that nonsense mutations caused a loss of function of the DYRK1A protein, which had effects on dendritic outgrowth in neurons, dendritic spine development and embryonic cortical migration. Moreover, upregulation and downregulation of Dyrk1a also reduced the dendritic spine density in rat hippocampal slice cultures. Importantly, cortical migration during the mouse embryonic stage was also altered by the overexpression of WT Dyrk1a from E14.5 to P0. Based on these results, we conclude that Dyrk1a has a key role in embryonic development.Furthermore, overexpression of the two nonsense truncations resembled defects caused by Dyrk1a knockdown, suggesting that patients carrying Dyrk1a nonsense mutations show haploinsufficiency of Dyrk1a. Reduced DYRK1A proteins levels of in patients likely lead to defects in neural development and further ASD symptoms, providing new evidence that the dosage of Dyrk1a is critical for proper neurite and axonal outgrowth.To date, the impact of Dyrk1a loss of function on neural development remains limited. For example, mice expressing only one copy of Dyrk1a exhibit a microcephalic phenotype.<45>, <46> However, the functional consequences of Dyrk1a loss of function have not been fully addressed. Dyrk1a knockout was reported to be lethal during the embryonic period, whereas Dyrk1a+/− mice survive but display severe defects in cognition, DDs and abnormalities in brain size and structure.<47>, <48> Thus it is difficult to undertake further analyses of this gene in a loss-of-function mouse model. The two Dyrk1a truncations we found in ASD patients provide important insights into the role of loss-of-function forms of Dyrk1a in various aspects of neural development.DYRK1A phosphorylates multiple substrates."
PMC5822466_4,"For instance, P53 Ser15 is directly phosphorylated by DYRK1A, and P53 phosphorylation at this site inhibits the proliferation of neural progenitors <10> DYRK1A has been shown to selectively phosphorylate RCAN1 at Ser112, prompting the phosphorylation of another residue, Ser108, by GSK3β and resulting in the formation of insoluble aggregates that contribute to the development of Alzheimer disease.<11> N-WASP Thr192 may also be a substrate for DYRK1A phosphorylation, and spine formation can be inhibited by phosphorylation at this site.<12> DYRK1A phosphorylates Tau at multiple sites, leading to decreased microtubule assembly and the formation of interneuron aggregates.<13>, <23> These observations reveal the potential role of Dyrk1a in dendritic outgrowth. In addition, DYRK1A negatively regulates nuclear factor of activated T cells by phosphorylating the serine-proline repeats 3 domain.<49> Further studies are required to illustrate the exact substrates of DYRK1A that are responsible for various aspects of neural development.In the present study, we showed that both excessive and reduced Dyrk1a activity yield similar phenotypes of delayed neural development that were distinct from the phenotypes associated with other candidate genes in neurodevelopment.<50> Although ASD and DS are both neuronal development disorders and although previous studies have mostly focused on the relationship between DYRK1A and DS,<9>, <15>, <21>, <23> there are essential differences between ASD and DS. For example, the incidence stage and the specific phenotypes differ; severe mental retardation and delayed development is observed in DS patients, whereas verbal dysfunction and social problems are often observed in ASD patients.<2> Genes in the DSCR region of chromosome 21 have clear connections with DS, whereas genetic factors other than chromosome 21 are associated with ASD. Thus it is important and necessary to identify the mechanisms by which DYRK1A contributes to ASD.In summary, we found that Dyrk1a strongly affected various aspects of neuronal development, such as dendritic outgrowth, dendritic spine density and cortical migration, during early postnatal development. Importantly, R205X and E239X, two DYRK1A truncations that were identified in ASD/ID/DD patients, functioned as loss-of-function mutants. rhetorical Figure 1 Wild-type (WT) Dyrk1a (dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 A) overexpression reduced total neurite and axon length of neurons in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons.

PhyloP: highly conserved 0.00138 0 The genomic and bioinformatics analysis of DYRK1A variants that may be associated with ASD/ID/DD Autism is a prevailing neurodevelopmental disorder with a large genetic/genomic component. Recently, the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 A (DYRK1A) gene was implicated as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We identified five DYRK1A variants in ASD patients and found that the dose of DYRK1A protein has a crucial role in various aspects of postnatal neural development. Dyrk1a loss of function and gain of function led to defects in dendritic growth, dendritic spine development and radial migration during cortical development. Importantly, two autism-associated truncations, R205X and E239X, were shown to be Dyrk1a loss-of-function mutants. Studies of the truncated Dyrk1a mutants may provide new insights into the role of Dyrk1a in brain development, as well as the role of Dyrk1a loss of function in the pathophysiology of autism. ."
