PMC4859346_0,"Tau toxicity has been implicated in the emergence of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the mechanism by which tau alters synapse physiology and leads to cognitive decline is unclear. Here, we report abnormal acetylation of K274 and K281 on tau, identified in AD brains, promotes memory loss and disrupts synaptic plasticity by reducing postsynaptic KIBRA (KIdney/BRAin protein), a memory-associated protein. Transgenic mice expressing human tau with lysine-to-glutamine mutations to mimic K274 and K281 acetylation (tauKQ) exhibit AD-related memory deficits and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which pathogenic tau causes synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD pathogenesis.

The Gladstone Institutes received support from a National Center for Research Resources Grant RR18928. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes gradual memory loss associated with synapse deterioration. Tauopathies, including AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau), are characterized by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein. Cognitive decline coincides with the deposition of NFTs in AD progression (<Giannakopoulos et al., 2003>); however, the presence of NFTs is not sufficient to cause memory loss in FTLD-tau transgenic mice (<Santacruz et al., 2005>; <Sydow et al., 2011>; <Van der Jeugd et al., 2012>). Although it is widely accepted that tau plays a significant role in AD pathogenesis, the entity of the toxic species and the mechanism by which tau causes cognitive decline in AD are still unclear.Fine-tuning of synaptic strength in response to neuronal activity is critical for cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. Synapses are particularly vulnerable to toxicity in AD, and synapse loss is correlated with cognitive decline (<DeKosky and Scheff, 1990>). In FTLD-tau mouse models, mutant tau alters the efficacy of synaptic transmission and disrupts plasticity linked to behavioral deficits (<Hoover et al., 2010>; <Warmus et al., 2014>; <Yoshiyama et al., 2007>). Under pathological conditions, tau is missorted from axons into dendritic compartments and postsynaptic spines (<Zempel and Mandelkow, 2014>). In cultured neurons, mislocalization of an FTLD-tau mutant in postsynaptic spines depletes glutamate receptors (<Hoover et al., 2010>), and amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers induce missorting of tau into dendrites and spine retraction (<Zempel et al., 2010>). Moreover, postsynaptic targeting of Fyn kinase by tau exacerbates excitotoxicity in an AD mouse model (<Ittner et al., 2010>). These findings support a key role for tau-mediated pathogenesis at postsynaptic sites; yet, how tau affects the synaptic mechanisms underlying the encoding of memory is largely unknown.The activity of p300 acetyltransferase is enhanced in human AD brain (<Aubry et al., 2015>), and p300 acetylates tau (<Min et al., 2010>). Human tauopathy brains display a marked pathological enhancement of tau acetylation (<Grinberg et al., 2013>; <Irwin et al., 2013>; <Irwin et al., 2012>; <Min et al., 2015>; <Min et al., 2010>). Acetylation of proteins can alter their function, modify their interactions with binding partners, and affect their stability (<Spange et al., 2009>). Likewise, acetylation affects tau in different ways. It inhibits tau binding to microtubules (<Cohen et al., 2011>), promotes tau accumulation by preventing its degradation (<Min et al., 2015>; <Min et al., 2010>), and enhances tau oligomerization and aggregation (<Cohen et al., 2011>). These studies support the notion that aberrantly acetylated tau (ac-tau) is pathogenic, but whether ac-tau induces neuronal dysfunction underlying cognitive decline is unknown.The KIBRA gene was first linked to human memory performance in a genome-wide screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006>). Predominantly expressed in memory-associated regions of the brain, KIBRA is enriched at postsynaptic sites (<Schneider et al., 2010>; <Zhang et al., 2014>). It interacts with components of postsynaptic glutamate receptor complexes (<Makuch et al., 2011>), actin regulatory networks (<Duning et al., 2008>; <Kremerskothen et al., 2003>; <Kremerskothen et al., 2005>), and kinase signaling pathways (<Buther et al., 2004>; <Vogt-Eisele et al., 2014>). Mice deficient in KIBRA have impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory deficits (<Makuch et al., 2011>). Intriguingly, KIBRA SNPs have been implicated in increased risk for late-onset AD (<Burgess et al., 2011>; <Corneveaux et al., 2010>; <Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2009>).Here we report that brains from AD patients with dementia exhibit significantly higher levels of tau acetylated on lysine-274 (K274) and lysine-281 (K281). To define the effects of the aberrant acetylation of these lysines on brain function and cognition, we generated transgenic mice using the murine prion promoter to drive expression of either wild-type human tau (tauWT) or human tau with lysine-to-glutamine substitutions to mimic the charge and structure of acetylated K274 and K281 (tauKQ). We investigated the effects of tauKQ on synaptic plasticity and memory encoding and established the dysregulation of postsynaptic mechanisms involving activity-dependent actin polymerization and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking. Our study also provides a mechanistic link between aberrant tau acetylation, KIBRA deficiency, and dementia in AD. To investigate the acetylated lysine residues on tau in tauopathy, we immunoprecipitated tau from homogenized human AD brain and rTg4510 mouse brain, a FTLD-tau model that exhibits pathological tau accumulation (<Santacruz et al., 2005>), and performed analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. K274 was acetylated in rTg4510 mouse brain (<Figure 1A>), in agreement with acetylated K274 (ac-K274) observed in human AD brain (<Grinberg et al., 2013>). A novel acetylation site on K281 was identified in human AD brain (<Figure 1B>). K274 and K281 are in the microtubule binding domain of tau. Two monoclonal antibodies, MAb359 and MAb63, were generated using an ac-tau peptide containing amino acids 264–287 as the antigen (<Figure 1C>). In HEK293 cells, MAb359 and MAb63 showed strong immunoreactivity for tauWT only in the presence of the acetyltransferase p300 (<Figure 1D>). A single mutation of lysine to arginine for either K274 (K274R) or K281 (K281R) that blocks p300-induced acetylation eliminates the signal from MAb359 and MAb63, respectively (<Figure 1D>)."
PMC4859346_1,"Blocking acetylation of other lysines did not affect the immunoreactivity of these antibodies for ac-tau (<Figure S1A>)  These results established the specificity of MAb359 for ac-K274 and MAb63 for acetylated K281 (ac-K281).To assess tau acetylation in an AD-related mouse model, we established a transgenic mouse that expresses tauWT driven by the murine prion promoter, and crossed it with human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP)-J20 mice that have high hAPP/Aβ levels (<Mucke et al., 2000>). Modest levels of ac-K274 and ac-K281 were detected in hippocampus of 6-month-old tauWT mice, and were significantly elevated in doubly transgenic mice that also express hAPP (<Figures 1E–1G>). To investigate ac-tau levels in human brains, we first confirmed the antibody specificity in a competition assay, in which MAb359 and MAb63 immunoreactivity was blocked by pre-incubation with recombinant human tau acetylated by p300 (<Figure S1B and S1C>). MAb359 and MAb63 immunoreactivities were markedly higher in the superior temporal gyrus of AD patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 5—the most severe dementia cases—than those that were CDR 0 with no cognitive impairments (<Figures 1H–1J>). In mildly demented cases (CDR 0.5), the amounts of ac-K274 were similar to non-demented cases, whereas ac-K281 levels were significantly greater (<Figures 1H–1J>). Thus, aberrant acetylation of K274 and K281 is upregulated by high Aβ/hAPP levels and associated with cognitive impairments in AD. To explore how ac-K274 and ac-K281 could contribute to cognitive deficits in AD, we generated transgenic mice expressing human tau with lysine to glutamine mutations at K274 and K281 (tauKQ) to mimic acetylation. Since glutamine resembles the chemical structure and neutral charge of acetyl-lysine, this residue substitution is widely used to study the effects of acetylation on specific lysine residues (<Hecht et al., 1995>; <Liu et al., 2012>; <Scroggins et al., 2007>; <Wang et al., 2003>). As in the tauWT mice, the murine prion promoter was used to drive tauKQ transgene expression. We established two founder lines: tauKQ mice that express HT7-positive human tau at similar levels as tauWT mice, and a higher expression line called tauKQhigh (<Figures 2A and 2B>). In situ hybridization revealed that the human tau expression patterns in hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum were similar in tauWT, tauKQ, and tauKQhigh lines (<Figure S2>). Compared with nontransgenic (ntg) controls, similar levels of astrogliosis were induced in the dentate gyrus of all three lines, as detected with GFAP immunoreactivity (<Figures 2C and 2D>). Phosphorylation of human tau was detected in tauWT mice (<Figures S3A–S3D>), consistent with another human tau transgenic mouse line (<Andorfer et al., 2003>). Phospho-serine 202/205 (AT8) levels on tauKQ were reduced whereas phosho-serine 396/404 (PHF-1) and threonine 181 (AT270) levels were similar to tauWT (<Figures S3A–S3D>). Caspase-cleaved tau was observed in the hippocampus of tauKQhigh mice, but not in tauWT or tauKQ mice (<Figure S3E>). Tau was also monitored with MC1 staining, which recognizes a pathological confirmation of tau in FTLD-tau mouse models (<Decker et al., 2015>; <Sydow et al., 2011>; <Van der Jeugd et al., 2012>). Consistent with pathogenicity of ac-K274 and ac-K281, tauKQ mice exhibited significantly higher MC1 immunoreactivity than tauWT mice, which was further elevated in tauKQhigh mice (<Figures 2E and 2F>). To determine if ac-tau affects synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus associated with memory loss, field recordings were performed in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of acute hippocampal slices. After theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of the perforant pathway to dentate granule cell (DGC) synapses, LTP in tauWT slices was sustained at the same level as ntg slices for the duration of the recordings (<Figure 3A>). In contrast, potentiation significantly declined in tauKQ slices by 60 min after LTP induction (<Figure 3B>). Since tauWT and tauKQ mice have similar levels of human tau (<Figures 2A and 2B>), these results support the pathogenicity of ac-K274 and ac-K281. Moreover, tauKQhigh slices exhibited a pronounced LTP impairment (<Figure 3C>).In basal synaptic transmission, the strength of the perforant pathway inputs and the postsynaptic responsiveness of DGCs in tauWT, tauKQ or tauKQhigh slices were similar to ntg controls (<Figures 3D–3F>). Perforant pathway inputs also showed normal presynaptic release properties in slices from tauKQ-expressing mice (<Figure 3G>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of DGCs from ntg and tauKQhigh slices revealed comparable AMPAR- and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic strength (<Figures 3H–3J>). Thus, the tauKQ-induced LTP deficit is not likely due to insufficient plasticity induction, but rather to the inhibition of long-term synaptic strengthening. To determine the functional outcome of ac-K274 and ac-K281, we focused our behavioral tests in tauKQhigh mice. Spatial learning and memory was examined in the Morris water maze test (MWM). During hidden platform training, there was no significant difference between 11–13-month-old ntg and tauKQhigh mice in spatial learning or swim speed (<Figures 4A and 4B>). In 24 h and 72 h probe trials, ntg mice demonstrated robust spatial memory with a strong preference for the target quadrant (<Figures 4C and 4D>). In contrast, the amount of time that tauKQhigh mice spent in the target quadrant was not significantly different from chance levels in the 72 h probe trial (<Figures 4C and 4D>), indicating that tauKQhigh mice were impaired in spatial memory.Besides spatial memory deficits, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD also exhibit deficiencies in distinguishing between similar experiences (<Ally et al., 2013>; <Wesnes et al., 2014>; <Yassa et al., 2010>). To determine if aberrant ac-tau interferes with the encoding of distinct memories, we performed two different behavioral tests to assess pattern separation in tauKQhigh mice. Mice were first tested in an object-context discrimination task (<Jain et al., 2012>) in which they learn to associate specific objects with two distinct contexts during a sample phase, followed by a test phase to assess their ability to distinguish the incongruent object within the familiar context (<Figure 4E>). At 6–7 months old, ntg, tauWT and tauKQhigh mice spent an equal proportion of time exploring the objects in the sample phase (<Figure 4F>). However, unlike ntg and tauWT mice, which spent significantly more time exploring the incongruent object during the test phase, tauKQhigh mice showed no preference, suggesting that tauKQhigh mice were unable to differentiate between previous experiences (<Figure 4G>).We also examined pattern separation by testing contextual discrimination learning with fear conditioning. The ability of mice to learn to distinguish between two highly similar contexts in this test requires DGC function (<McHugh et al., 2007>; <Nakashiba et al., 2012>). In the fear acquisition phase, 10–12-month-old ntg and tauKQhigh mice exhibited similar levels of freezing when shocked in context A (<Figure 4H>). In the subsequent generalization phase, ntg and tauKQhigh mice showed generalized fear between context A and a highly similar context B (<Figure 4I>). For the next 16 days of contextual discrimination training a foot shock was given in A (non-safe), but not in B (safe) (<Figure 4J>). Ntg mice learned to discriminate the two contexts with increasing freezing in A, but not in B (<Figure 4K>). TauKQhigh mice exhibited significantly worse discrimination between A and B than ntg mice (<Figure 4K>). When mice were tested in two very different contexts C (non-safe) and D (safe), tauKQhigh and ntg mice likewise demonstrated the ability to distinguish between C and D (<Figure S4>). These results suggest that ac-tau interferes with the encoding of similar experiences as distinct memories. We next dissected the molecular mechanism underlying the ac-tau-induced deficits in LTP, spatial memory and pattern separation."
PMC4859346_2,"In cultured hippocampal neurons, induction of chemical LTP by a brief exposure to glycine (300 μM) in the absence of magnesium recruits additional GluA1-containing AMPARs to the postsynaptic surface, resulting in the long-term enhancement of synaptic strength (<Lu et al , 2001>; <Oku and Huganir, 2013>). To determine if ac-tau affects the activity-induced trafficking of AMPARs, neurons were co-transfected with mApple and GFP-tagged tauWT, tauKQ or tau with lysine-to-arginine mutations to block the acetylation of K274 and K281 (tauKR). Based on the fluorescence intensity of GFP-tagged tau measured in the cell soma, there were equivalent levels of tauWT, tauKQ and tauKR in neurons (<Figure S5>). The basal level of GluA1 in spines in neurons expressing tauWT, tauKQ, or tauKR was not significantly different from control neurons (<Figures 5A and 5B>). In neurons with tauWT or tauKR, chemical LTP increased the surface GluA1 immunostaining in spines similarly to control neurons (<Figures 5A and 5B>). However, tauKQ blocked the recruitment of AMPARs to spines after chemical LTP (<Figures 5A and 5B>), suggesting that aberrant levels of ac-tau in neurons inhibits the insertion of postsynaptic AMPARs required for LTP. Consistent with a postsynaptic role for ac-tau in pathogenesis, ac-K274 and ac-K281 tau was present in the postsynaptic density in human AD brain (<Figure 5C>).The activity-dependent recruitment of synaptic AMPARs and the maintenance of LTP expression require actin polymerization (<Fukazawa et al., 2003>; <Krucker et al., 2000>). In the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, fluorescently conjugated phalloidin labels F-actin in spines of DGCs (<Capani et al., 2001>; <Fukazawa et al., 2003>). Human tau co-localized with F-actin in DGC spines of tauKQhigh mice (<Figures 5D>). Basal F-actin levels in the molecular layer of tauKQhigh slices were not significantly different from ntg slices (<Figures 5E–H>). TBS of the perforant pathway elevated DGC F-actin levels in the molecular layer of ntg slices and tauWT slices (<Figures S6A–S6D>), but not in tauKQhigh slices, suggesting that ac-tau disrupts the activity-dependent polymerization of postsynaptic actin (<Figures 5E–5H>). To investigate how acetylation affects tau binding to polymerized actin, phalloidin-bound F-actin was precipitated from tauWT and tauKQ mouse brain homogenate. TauWT, not tauKQ, coprecipitated with F-actin (<Figure S6E>), suggesting that acetylation weakens the interaction between tau and the actin cytoskeleton. Strikingly, treatment of slices from 5–6-month-old tauKQhigh mice with jasplakinolide (JPK), a membrane-permeable drug that promotes actin polymerization, restored LTP to ntg levels (<Figure 5I>). JPK had no observable effect on LTP in tauWT mice (<Figure S6F>). These results strongly support that the tauKQ-induced synaptic plasticity impairment is mediated by a deficiency in activity-dependent actin polymerization. Our data so far demonstrate that ac-tau disrupts postsynaptic signaling involving actin regulatory networks that control AMPAR insertion during LTP. KIBRA is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (<Johannsen et al., 2008>), and is linked to late-onset sporadic AD (<Burgess et al., 2011>; <Corneveaux et al., 2010>; <Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2009>). Levels of KIBRA protein (~150 kDa) in the brain of CDR 5 cases were significantly lower than CDR 0 cases, consistent with a link between KIBRA and AD (<Figures 6A and 6B>). The same KIBRA antibody recognized a specific ~150 kDa band in HEK293 cells overexpressing human KIBRA (<Figure S7A>). KIBRA levels remained significantly reduced in severely demented cases after normalization to the postsynaptic protein PSD-95, supporting KIBRA loss in synapses (<Figures 6C and 6D>). Notably, the enhancement of ac-K274 or ac-K281, which coincides with cognitive decline, exhibits a strong correlation with reduced KIBRA protein in AD (<Figures 6E and 6F>).We found no difference in the total amounts of KIBRA expressed in the hippocampus of tauKQhigh and ntg mice (<Figures S7B and S7C>). We next examined postsynaptic KIBRA levels in the phalloidin-labeled spines of DGCs (<Figure 6G>). Minimal KIBRA immunofluorescence was detected in KIBRA knockout mouse brain (<Figure S7D>). Compared to ntg mice, tauKQhigh mice exhibited weaker KIBRA immunolabeling overlapping with F-actin puncta (<Figure 6H and 6I>), whereas KIBRA co-localization with F-actin was normal in tauWT mice (<Figures S7E and S7F>). These data support that high levels of ac-tau trigger a reduction in postsynaptic KIBRA. Does aberrant tau acetylation impair plasticity by downregulating KIBRA. Similar to our transgenic mice expressing tauKQ (<Figure 3>), KIBRA-deficient mice have normal basal synaptic transmission but impaired LTP expression (<Makuch et al., 2011>). We next determined if enhancing KIBRA expression could re-establish plasticity in tauKQ-expressing neurons. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transduced with KIBRA, which was localized in dendrites and within spines (<Figure 7A>). In unstimulated conditions, quantification of surface GluA1 immunolabeling in spines did not reveal significant differences among control neurons and neurons expressing KIBRA, tauKQ, or KIBRA with tauKQ (<Figure 7B and 7C>). After chemical LTP, surface GluA1 immunoreactivity was enhanced in spines of control and KIBRA neurons but AMPAR insertion was blocked in tauKQ neurons (<Figure 7C>). Co-expression of KIBRA with tauKQ in neurons restored the recruitment of AMPARs to synapses (<Figure 7C>), confirming that increasing KIBRA levels was sufficient to reverse the AMPAR trafficking deficit triggered by tauKQ.Our data suggest that the tauKQ-induced plasticity impairment is mediated by loss of activity-dependent actin polymerization. To dissect the role of KIBRA in this process, we tested how KIBRA modulates actin polymerization in spines of tauKQ-expressing neurons. In unstimulated neurons, F-actin levels in spines were not significantly changed by KIBRA or tauKQ (<Figures 7D and 7E>). As expected, spines on control neurons showed an increase in F-actin after chemical LTP, which was likewise observed in KIBRA neurons (<Figure 7E>). The activity-induced polymerization of actin at synapses was blocked by tauKQ, but it was completely rescued by the co-expression of KIBRA (<Figure 7E>). These results support a novel mechanism for pathophysiology in AD in which ac-tau reduces KIBRA levels at synapses, leading to impaired actin-based plasticity and loss of synapse potentiation (<Figure 8>). Our findings suggest that aberrant ac-K274 and ac-K281 on tau is a contributing factor to memory loss related to tauopathies, including AD. We showed that dementia in AD is associated with elevated levels of ac-K274 and ac-K281, which correlated negatively with those of KIBRA, a synaptic protein critical for AMPAR trafficking. Mimicking acetylation of these lysines in transgenic mice impairs synaptic plasticity and memory retention, likely due to deficient activity-dependent actin polymerization and AMPAR trafficking. Elevating KIBRA in neurons expressing acetyl-mimicking tau was sufficient to re-establish actin polymerization and AMPAR insertion during plasticity.We identified acetylation of K274 and K281 on tau in the brain of a tauopathy mouse model and human AD brain, respectively, and developed specific antibodies targeting either ac-K274 or ac-K281. Immunoblots confirmed that levels of K274 and K281 acetylation are greater in AD patients with severe dementia than non-demented cases. Acetylation of K281, but not K274, was increased in patients with mild dementia, which supports a potential divergence in the regulation of acetylation on these residues during pathogenesis. The cause of specific tau hyperacetylation in AD is unknown; however, possible mechanisms include p300 dysregulation (<Aubry et al., 2015>), loss of sirtuin 1 (<Julien et al., 2009>), or tau autoacetyltransferase activity (<Cohen et al., 2013>). In an AD mouse model with human tau, levels of ac-K274 and ac-K281 were elevated, illustrating a link between pathogenic hAPP/Aβ and aberrant tau acetylation."
PMC4859346_3,"In cultured neurons, Aβ oligomers are sufficient to increase acetylated tau levels (<Min et al , 2010>). Whether APP or its proteolytic fragments promote tau acetylation in vivo remains to be determined. Interestingly, levels of ac-K270 (homologous to K281 on human tau) and other acetylated lysines on murine tau were not affected by hAPP/Aβ (<Morris et al., 2015>), suggesting that acetylation of human and murine tau could be modulated differently. Notably, ac-K274, while highly enriched in AD and other tauopathy brains (<Grinberg et al., 2013>), was not detected in ntg or hAPP/Aβ mice lacking pathogenic tau accumulation, supporting the specificity of ac-K274 as a pathogenic signature for tauopathy.We developed three lines of transgenic mice that express either tauWT or tauKQ and established a causal role for ac-K274 and ac-K281 in synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits. Electrophysiological analyses revealed LTP deficits in mice expressing tauKQ, but not in mice expressing equivalent levels of tauWT. The strength of presynaptic inputs or postsynaptic responsiveness in basal transmission was not altered by tauKQ, supporting that the expression of plasticity is preferentially affected. Indeed, tauKQ mice are largely normal behaviorally, but they exhibited deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and dentate gyrus-associated pattern separation. Since acetylation neutralizes the positive charges on lysines, acetylation of K274 and K281 in the microtubule binding domain could have a profound effect on the conformation and aggregation propensity of tau. Acetylation of K280 is associated with aggregation of phosphorylated tau (<Cohen et al., 2011>), whereas acetylated lysines in KXGS motifs block site-specific phosphorylation and tau aggregation (<Cook et al., 2014>). With the ac-K274 and ac-K281 mimic, phosphorylated residues on tau were either reduced or unchanged, suggesting that hyperphosphorylated tau does not trigger the physiological and behavioral phenotypes in tauKQ-expressing mice. These tauKQ-induced phenotypes were also unlikely due to astrogliosis that occurred in in all three lines expressing either tauWT or tauKQ. The hippocampus of tauKQhigh mice had caspase-3-cleaved tau fragments that are linked to neurotoxicity in AD (<Gamblin et al., 2003>; <Rissman et al., 2004>). However, the C3 fragments were undetectable in the lower expresser tauKQ mice with LTP deficits, suggesting that the C3 fragment is unlikely to be the major culprit of tauKQ-induced plasticity impairment. Pathologically, the accumulation of MC1-positive tau in DGC mossy fibers was significantly higher in tauKQ mice than those expressing similar levels of tauWT. The exact toxic tau species responsible for synaptic and behavioral deficits in tauKQ mice remains to be identified.Mechanistic dissection revealed that pathogenic ac-K274 and ac-K281 obstructs the activity-dependent modifications in postsynaptic strength. Specifically, ac-K274 and ac-K281 on tau blocks activity-induced F-actin assembly, thereby inhibiting AMPAR insertion and synapse potentiation. In tauKQ-expressing mice, promoting actin polymerization with JPK rescued LTP, suggesting that ac-tau destabilizes F-actin accumulation in the postsynaptic compartment. Tau binds to F-actin (<Correas et al., 1990>; <DuBoff et al., 2012>), and regulates F-actin bundling (<Cunningham et al., 1997>; <Fulga et al., 2007>). The KQ mutation weakened the interaction of tau with F-actin, raising the possibility that acetylation inhibits tau-actin binding and contributes to actin destabilization during activity-dependent polymerization. Aβ treatment or neuronal activity regulates the interaction of tau with F-actin (<Frandemiche et al., 2014>) and phosphorylated tau causes abnormal F-actin accumulation in neurons (<Fulga et al., 2007>). However, whether tau regulates actin dynamics at synapses through a direct interaction remains unclear. The finding that ac-tau inhibits synaptic plasticity is very different from the effect of phosphorylated tau, which is linked with the downregulation of glutamate receptors at synapses and loss of spines (<Hoover et al., 2010>). On the other hand, the interaction between tau and Fyn kinase can induce NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity (<Ittner et al., 2010>). Thus, pathogenic forms of tau can trigger postsynaptic dysfunction through different mechanisms. It will be interesting to determine how these synaptic mechanisms collectively contribute to the progression of cognitive decline in AD.In AD brains, we found higher levels of ac-tau associated with reduced levels of KIBRA, a critical regulator of AMPARs recycling (<Makuch et al., 2011>). Interestingly, levels of KIBRA mRNA are upregulated in neurons from AD brain (<Corneveaux et al., 2010>), which may represent a compensatory response for the loss of KIBRA protein that we observe. Synapse degeneration could account for a portion of the KIBRA lost in the brain. Even so, KIBRA is significantly reduced relative to PSD-95, another postsynaptic protein, indicating that, in addition to synapse loss, another mechanism likely contributes to KIBRA deficiency. Enhanced tau acetylation appears to correlate with the reduced levels of KIBRA, which points toward a role for pathogenic tau in the dysregulation of KIBRA in AD.Acetyl-mimicking tau reduced postsynaptic KIBRA associated with F-actin in DGC spines. The mechanism by which ac-tau disrupts the synaptic localization of KIBRA remains to be established, but it could be an early event in disease pathogenesis. Later in disease progression, the mislocalization of KIBRA could result in its degradation by another mechanism leading to lower overall KIBRA levels in AD brains at CDR 5. Importantly, driving KIBRA expression in neurons with tauKQ restored actin dynamics and AMPAR trafficking at synapses during LTP. This suggests that a sufficient amount of KIBRA at synapses is essential for the regulation of actin and AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. KIBRA interacts with actin cytoskeletal regulators that are involved in synaptic plasticity, including synaptopodin (<Duning et al., 2008>), dendrin (<Kremerskothen et al., 2003>) and PICK1 (<Makuch et al., 2011>). Given that KIBRA modulates the F-actin rich processes of epithelial cells during cell migration (<Duning et al., 2008>), actin-based plasticity in spines may rely on similar signaling pathways. KIBRA also interacts with the protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) (<Buther et al., 2004>), an active atypical PKC isoform that plays a role in LTP maintenance (<Serrano et al., 2005>) and memory (<Drier et al., 2002>). PKMζ accumulates in NFTs in human AD brain (<Crary et al., 2006>), raising the possibility of a mechanistic link between tau, KIBRA and PKMζ. Taken together, our results demonstrate that acetylated tau in AD disrupts one or more KIBRA-mediated signaling pathways that are crucial for the expression of synaptic plasticity.Our findings suggest that ac-tau blocks activity-dependent AMPAR trafficking by reducing postsynaptic KIBRA and inhibiting actin dynamics, establishing a novel pathway for tau-mediated synaptic dysfunction. We propose that therapeutic strategies designed to reduce tau acetylation could help restore cognitive function in AD. Immunoprecipitated tau from brain homogenate was separated on a 1D-SDS-PAGE gel. Subsequent excision from the gel and in-gel digestion with trypsin was performed prior to mass spectrometric analysis by reversed-phase nano-HPLC ESI-MS/MS using a QqTOF QSTAR Elite mass spectrometer (SCIEX).

In healthy brain (left), LTP induction leads to F-actin accumulation in dendritic spines followed by the recruitment of additional AMPARs to the surface of the postsynaptic membrane. Postsynaptic KIBRA modulates these events through its interactions with AMPAR-regulating complexes, actin-modulating proteins, or kinases. In AD brain (right), enhanced levels of K274 and K281 acetylation on tau triggers a reduction of KIBRA at synapses. Consequently, postsynaptic F-actin assembly and AMPAR trafficking is blocked after patterns of activity that normally induce LTP. Tau toxicity has been implicated in the emergence of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the mechanism by which tau alters synapse physiology and leads to cognitive decline is unclear. Here, we report abnormal acetylation of K274 and K281 on tau, identified in AD brains, promotes memory loss and disrupts synaptic plasticity by reducing postsynaptic KIBRA (KIdney/BRAin protein), a memory-associated protein. Transgenic mice expressing human tau with lysine-to-glutamine mutations to mimic K274 and K281 acetylation (tauKQ) exhibit AD-related memory deficits and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). TauKQ reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which pathogenic tau causes synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD pathogenesis. ."
PMC4075151_0,"The identification of tau protein as a major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles spurred considerable effort devoted to identifying and validating pathways through which therapeutics may alleviate tau burden in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy associated with sport- and military-related injuries. Most tau-based therapeutic strategies have previously focused on modulating tau phosphorylation, given that tau species present within neurofibrillary tangles are hyperphosphorylated on a number of different residues. However, the recent discovery that tau is modified by acetylation necessitates additional research to provide greater mechanistic insight into the spectrum of physiological consequences of tau acetylation, which may hold promise as a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we discuss recent findings evaluating tau acetylation in the context of previously accepted notions regarding tau biology and pathophysiology. We also examine the evidence demonstrating the neuroprotective and beneficial consequences of inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)6, a tau deacetylase, including its effect on microtubule stabilization. We also discuss the rationale for pharmacologically modulating HDAC6 in tau-based pathologies as a novel therapeutic strategy. The authors wish to express their gratitude to Tania F Gendron for helpful discussion and suggestions.

The identification of tubulin as the first cytosolic protein to be modified by acetylation [<1>,<2>] challenged the traditional notion that acetylation only serves as a mechanism to regulate transcription through modification of histones. Since this discovery in 1985, researchers have sought to identify other proteins that undergo acetylation events and elucidate the effects of this post-translational modification on protein structure and function. Global proteomic studies allowed for the identification of hundreds of proteins that are acetylated on one or multiple lysine residues, as well as a myriad of lysine acetyltransferases and deacetylases, which respectively govern protein acetylation and deacetylation [<1>,<3>]. The discovery that the microtubule-associated protein tau is also a target of acetyltransferase and deacetylase enzymes [<4>,<5>] added a new layer of complexity, whereby the impact of phosphorylation or ubiquitination on tau function and biology will now need to be re-evaluated to include consideration of tau acetylation. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the recent findings associated with tau acetylation, a novel post-translational modification of tau, how it influences tau aggregation and function, and whether it could be exploited therapeutically as a treatment for tauopathies. As lysine residues are unique in their ability to participate in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions [<6>,<7>], and are also known to play a critical role in tau assembly and toxicity [<8>-<10>], we and others recently questioned whether tau acetylation of lysine residues would modulate its potential to aggregate [<4>,<11>]. Cohen and collagues [<4>] utilized the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) to acetylate a fragment of tau comprising the microtubule-binding domain (commonly referred to as K18), and observed an increase in aggregation of the K18 fragment. We subsequently performed a similar analysis but using full-length tau and the acetyltransferase p300; we detected a decrease in filament assembly following tau acetylation, the extent of which correlated with the concentration of p300 [<11>]. We also observed a complete reversal of p300-mediated acetylation and inhibition of tau assembly upon addition of the deacetylase histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 [<11>]. Furthermore, the modulation of tau assembly by acetylation was dependent on modification of tau’s KXGS motifs in the microtubule-binding domain, as evidenced by the fact pseudoacetylation of the four KXGS motifs generated a tau species that was assembly-incompetent and resistant to modulation by either p300 or HDAC6 [<11>]. The results from these two studies suggest that CBP and p300 may preferentially acetylate different residues in tau, thereby differentially impacting tau’s intrinsic propensity to aggregate.Cohen and colleagues [<12>] later reported that tau can be acetylated in the absence of the enzyme CBP, an effect attributed to a previously unrecognized role of tau as an acetyltransferase enzyme. Cys291 and Cys322 were identified as the catalytic residues responsible for this novel function of tau [<12>]. We have not observed acetylation of full-length tau in the absence of an exogenous acetyltransferase enzyme [<11>], indicating that certain experimental conditions, but not all, favor nonenzymatic acetylation [<4>,<12>-<14>]. It is worth noting that nonenzymatic acetylation of cysteine residues has been reported [<15>], raising the possibility that the increase in tau assembly following acetylation observed by the Cohen group could be due to the modification of amino acid residues other than lysine. Future studies to delineate the physiological consequences of tau acetylation in a site-specific manner and to map the pattern of acetylation produced by different acetyltransferase and deacetylase enzymes are therefore imperative. The multitude of molecular and functional properties of the microtubule-associated protein tau are predominantly due to the protein’s natively unfolded structure, allowing tau to not only interact with a large number of other cellular proteins, but also undergo a variety of post-translational modifications [<16>]. The occurrence of several post-translational modifications on numerous proteins has been well described, and it has been postulated that the interaction of such modifications governs complex regulatory processes, which are essential for proper protein function and for the regulation of diverse cellular events [<3>]. While each post-translational modification is distinct and utilizes different chemical groups to modify a given protein on specific residues, a certain degree of overlap exists [<3>,<17>]. For instance, lysine residues are targets for acetylation events and other modifications, including ubiquitination, sumoylation and methylation [<3>]. Thus, a measure of rivalry between different post-translational modifications must exist, where the addition of one chemical group to a given residue precludes further modifications [<3>].Intense investigation into the role of post-translational modifications, specifically phosphorylation and acetylation, has now begun, driven by the potential implications of these modifications in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies [<4>,<11>,<16>,<18>,<19>] (Figure <1>). Tau’s function as a phosphoprotein is attributed to its 85 potential phosphorylation sites, which are predominantly located in the proline-rich domain and the carboxy-terminal region of the protein flanking tau’s microtubule-binding domains [<18>,<19>]. Of these sites, approximately 20 serine and threonine residues have been found to be associated with normal, physiologically important phosphorylation events [<20>,<21>]. In addition, it is well-documented that the phosphorylation status of tau is developmentally regulated, with higher phosphorylation levels being present during early developmental stages of the brain compared to the mature, adult brain [<16>,<19>,<22>]. These findings imply that tau phosphorylation is a dynamic, highly regulated process, requiring the precise interplay of a multitude of kinases and phosphatases [<18>,<22>]."

For example, all six isoforms of human tau are constituents of paired helical filaments (PHFs), with all isoforms abnormally hyperphosphorylated [<18>] in post-mortem brain tissue from AD patients. In addition, tau hyperphosphorylation has been reported to lead to conformational changes that decrease flexibility and affinity for microtubules, thereby promoting accumulation of tau in the cytosol and driving the formation of PHFs and NFTs [<18>,<24>]. The polymerization and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) has also been linked with impaired axonal transport and synaptic dysfunction, two early events associated with the neuronal degeneration observed in AD and other tauopathies [<18>,<25>]. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this pathological alteration of tau is critical to identify novel and effective neurotherapeutics for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies. rhetorical Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the tau protein with post-translational modification sites.

The post-translational modifications below the tau molecule illustrate the residues that are acetylated by both p300 and CREB-binding protein (black font) [<4>,<5>], only p300 (blue font) [<5>], or only CREB-binding protein (green font) [<4>].

Of these sites, approximately 20 serine and threonine residues have been found to be associated with normal, physiologically important phosphorylation events [<20>,<21>]. In addition, it is well-documented that the phosphorylation status of tau is developmentally regulated, with higher phosphorylation levels being present during early developmental stages of the brain compared to the mature, adult brain [<16>,<19>,<22>]. These findings imply that tau phosphorylation is a dynamic, highly regulated process, requiring the precise interplay of a multitude of kinases and phosphatases [<18>,<22>]. Because hyperphosphorylation of tau stimulates polymerization and accumulation in the form of insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [<18>,<22>,<23>], research has primarily focused on elucidating the underlying cause of aberrant tau phosphorylation and the effects of this post-translational modification on tau function. While the precise mechanisms underlying the formation of these characteristic neuropathological lesions remain to be fully elucidated, studies have implicated dysregulation of the many kinases and phosphatases that govern tau phosphorylation [<16>,<18>,<22>]. For example, all six isoforms of human tau are constituents of paired helical filaments (PHFs), with all isoforms abnormally hyperphosphorylated [<18>] in post-mortem brain tissue from AD patients. In addition, tau hyperphosphorylation has been reported to lead to conformational changes that decrease flexibility and affinity for microtubules, thereby promoting accumulation of tau in the cytosol and driving the formation of PHFs and NFTs [<18>,<24>]. The polymerization and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) has also been linked with impaired axonal transport and synaptic dysfunction, two early events associated with the neuronal degeneration observed in AD and other tauopathies [<18>,<25>]. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this pathological alteration of tau is critical to identify novel and effective neurotherapeutics for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies.Acetylation as a novel post-translational modification of tau was first described by Min and colleagues [<5>], who used synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 160 to 182 and 264 to 287 of the full-length (4R2N isoform) tau sequence to generate acetylated-tau antibodies. With these antibodies (referred to as Ab708 and 9AB), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was identified as the deacetylase for the acetylation sites contained within amino acids 160 to 182 (Ab708) and 264 to 287 (9AB) [<5>]. Based on these results, the authors proposed a model whereby the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 promotes the removal of acetyl groups from tau, thus allowing for the addition of ubiquitin to these freed lysine residues and subsequently enhancing tau’s proteasomal turnover [<5>]. This model speaks to the previously addressed complexity associated with post-translational modifications of tau, and underscores that we are still at the beginning of understanding which enzymes regulate tau acetylation and deacetylation events, and more specifically how tau modifications associated with acetylation govern tau biology.The discovery that tau is modified by acetylation [<5>] has since prompted new research efforts primarily focused on assessing the pathological significance of this novel aspect of tau biology [<4>,<5>,<26>,<27>]. Specifically, Irwin and associates [<27>] generated a novel antibody detecting acetylation of tau at K280, and concluded that tau acetylated at this epitope colocalized with other classical markers of tau pathology, with colocalization being most prominent in moderate to severe disease stages. Given that acetylation of tau at K280 is highest at late stages of disease, it is possible increased acetylation at this epitope is a response to the disease process, rather than a pathogenic mechanism responsible for tangle formation. In a subsequent report, Grinberg and colleagues [<26>] focused on a different tau acetylation site, and developed an antibody to detect acetylation on K274."
PMC4075151_2,"Although enhanced acetylation of tau on this epitope was observed in most tauopathies, the authors detected a lack of tau acetylation on K274 in the tauopathy agyrophilic grain disease [<26>]  As such, it is evident that additional research evaluating tau acetylation is needed to elucidate differences that may be attributed to site and disease.The discovery of tau acetylation also prompted efforts in our own lab to elucidate whether HDAC6 activity modulates tau’s pathogenicity directly through tau deacetylation [<11>,<28>]. We demonstrate that elevated HDAC6 activity increases phosphorylation of tau at the 12E8 epitope (pS262/356), a phospho-epitope present within the KXGS motifs of tau’s microtubule-binding domain. The phosphorylation of KXGS motifs within tau by the kinase Par-1/MARK2 is required for tau proteotoxicity in Drosophila [<29>], observed at very early stages of NFT formation in AD brain [<30>], and appears to prime tau for subsequent phosphorylation events [<29>,<31>]. Tau species phosphorylated on KXGS motifs are not recognized by cellular degradation machinery, including the tau ubiquitin ligase C-terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) and the heat shock protein 70/90 (Hsp70/90) chaperone complex [<32>,<33>], and are therefore particularly prone to accumulate. Of note, the synaptic toxicity of oligomeric amyloid beta is dependent upon the phosphorylation of tau’s KXGS motifs [<34>,<35>], providing additional support for a pathogenic role of this phospho-tau species. Given that tau species phosphorylated on KXGS motifs are resistant to degradation and accumulate in NFTs [<30>], fail to bind and stabilize microtubules [<36>], and are also primed for phosphorylation by other kinases [<29>,<31>], hyperactivation of HDAC6 would be expected to considerably enhance tau pathology. We recently demonstrated that, in addition to modulating phosphorylation at these critical KXGS motif regions, HDAC6 also regulates their acetylation [<11>]. As mentioned above, this acetylation decreases the ability of tau to aggregate in in vitro assays [<11>]. We also detect a competitive relationship between acetylation and phosphorylation on KXGS motifs, such that treatment with HDAC6 inhibitors simultaneously increases acetylation of tau, while blocking phosphorylation at these crucial motifs in mice [<11>]. Furthermore, KXGS motifs are hypoacetylated and hyperphosphorylated in patients with AD and in a progressive and well-characterized mouse model of tauopathy (rTg4510) [<11>,<37>]. The link between a loss of acetylation on KXGS motifs and disease pathogenesis is further strengthened by the observation that KXGS motifs are ubiquitinated in pathological tau purified from post-mortem human brain tissue in AD [<38>] (Figure <1>), thereby indicating such ubiquitination would preclude another post-translational modification, acetylation, from occurring.Overall, these results highlight the extreme complexity of post-translational modifications governing tau function, and illustrate the need for improved understanding of how modified tau species impact neuronal health. Given that HDAC6 had no effect on the acetylation of residues recognized by the Ab708 antibody [<5>], and that we recently demonstrated that deacetylation of KXGS motifs is mediated by HDAC6 and not SIRT1 [<11>], the pattern of tau acetylation is determined by more than one deacetylase. Future studies will be required to map the specific acetylation sites regulated by different deacetylases in order to determine the ultimate consequence(s) of modulating deacetylase (HDAC6 versus SIRT1) activity on tau function and biology. Moreover, pathological alterations of tau are most likely not the result of a single post-translational modification, but instead a combination of structural and functional alterations that may ultimately contribute to determine tau pathogenicity. Following identification of the tau protein as a major constituent of NFTs in AD and other tauopathies, several lines of research focused on identifying the mechanism(s) responsible for tau accumulation in disease. Most conducted studies have focused on the effect of hyperphosphorylation on tau turnover, due to the fact that hyperphosphorylation has been the first and one of the most prominent post-translational modifications associated with tau pathology [<33>,<39>-<42>]. In particular, previous studies have demonstrated that the tau ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, is unable to bind and ubiquitinate tau species phosphorylated by Par-1/MARK2 on the 12E8 epitope (S262/356) [<33>], a p-tau species that is also resistant to degradation upon treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors [<32>,<33>]. Tau phosphorylated at the PHF1 epitope (S396/404) is still susceptible to degradation following Hsp90 inhibition and actually exhibits an enhanced interaction with Hsp90 [<33>]. These findings indicate that certain p-tau species, rather than normal tau, are a preferred client protein of Hsp90, while some phosphorylation events, in particular those mediated by Par-1/MARK2 on tau’s KXGS motifs, generate a p-tau species not recognized by the chaperone network. Phosphorylation by Par-1/MARK2 on KXGS motifs in the microtubule-binding domain of tau has been shown to be required for initiation of the pathogenic cascade of hyperphosphorylation, which is ultimately associated with NFT formation in tauopathies [<29>]. HDAC6 disrupts this cascade by potentiating Par-1/MARK2-mediated phosphorylation of KXGS motifs (detected by the 12E8 antibody), an effect that is eliminated by pseudoacetylation of KXGS motifs [<11>]. In addition, our recent findings indicate that HDAC6 directly modulates tau polymerization and acetylation, and this relationship is dependent on the ability of HDAC6 to deacetylate tau specifically on KXGS motifs [<11>]. These results support the hypothesis that decreased HDAC6 activity increases acetylation of KXGS motifs and, in so doing, prevents phosphorylation of serine residues within the same motif. As acetylation and phosphorylation of KXGS motifs act in a competitive manner, and phosphorylation of KXGS motifs generates a p-tau species that is resistant to degradation, future studies will be required to determine whether acetylation of tau on KXGS motifs impacts the ability of the chaperone network to recognize tau in a similar manner to phosphorylation on these sites. Given that progressive hypoacetylation and hyperphosphorylation of KXGS motifs is observed in rTg4510 mice with aging [<11>], the fact that tau turnover also decreases with aging in rTg4510 mice [<43>] may indicate that the relationship between acetylation and phosphorylation on KXGS motifs regulates tau turnover. The effects of other post-translational modifications on tau turnover are unknown; thus, it remains to be determined whether differentially modified tau species are degraded by the same mechanisms as hyperphosphorylated tau, or if they are preferentially targeted to alternative degradation pathways.While hyperphosphorylated tau is ubiquitinated in patients with AD [<38>,<44>] (Figure <1>), indicating that pathological tau species may be successfully targeted for degradation, the accumulation of ubiquitinated tau species in those patients suggests dysfunction of either proteasomal or lysosomal degradation pathways contributes to NFT formation in disease. The fact that ubiquitination and acetylation both modify lysine residues indicates that these post-translational modifications most likely compete to modify specific residues. Given that aggregated tau within NFTs is ubiquitinated [<38>,<44>], it is possible that excessive ubiquitination of tau actually prevents acetylation, exacerbating tau aggregation. The notion that excessive ubiquitination of tau may be detrimental in tauopathies is somewhat counterintuitive. However, as NFTs are composed of ubiquitinated tau, it is clear that a failure of the cell to ubiquitinate tau is not the root cause of tau accumulation."
PMC4075151_3,"Thus, strategies to further enhance ubiquitination of tau are not likely to promote tau clearance in disease, indicating that different and potentially unconventional approaches will need to be considered in designing therapeutic strategies of the future  Specifically, recent evidence indicates that acetylation of tau on KXGS motifs under conditions of HDAC6 inhibition not only prevents aggregation, but also blocks phosphorylation on this same motif, thereby favoring tau clearance [<11>]. In addition, reports that KXGS motifs in tau species purified from NFTs are ubiquitinated [<38>,<42>] indicate that these KXGS motifs are not acetylated, consistent with the notion that tau species modified by acetylation on KXGS motifs do not aggregate into NFTs. As such, rather than developing strategies to enhance tau ubiquitination in an effort to facilitate clearance, strategies to promote tau acetylation specifically on KXGS motifs could be evaluated for therapeutic efficacy. Based on recent evidence that HDAC6 regulates tau acetylation on KXGS motifs, it is of particular interest that, in a Drosophila model of tauopathy, loss of HDAC6 activity rescued tau-induced microtubule defects in both neuronal and muscle cells [<45>]. This finding provides the first in vivo evidence that reducing HDAC6 activity in a model of tauopathy is protective. Further emphasizing the therapeutic potential of HDAC6 inhibitors are results demonstrating that loss of HDAC6 expression/activity is also neuroprotective in other neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<46>-<48>]. For instance, in a mouse model of AD, genetic ablation of HDAC6 alleviated cognitive impairment without impacting plaque burden, which may suggest that beneficial consequences of loss of HDAC6 expression are due to effects on endogenous tau, though this has not yet been assessed in this model [<47>]. Deletion of HDAC6 in a mouse model of mutant superoxide dismutase 1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also neuroprotective, as reflected by the extended life span of mice and increased motor axon integrity [<48>].Several groups have demonstrated that loss of HDAC6 activity rescues impaired mitochondrial trafficking along microtubules [<47>,<49>,<50>], most likely through enhanced tubulin acetylation, providing additional insight into the mechanisms by which HDAC6 inhibition enhances neuronal survival. In particular, tubulin acetylation has been shown to enhance the recruitment of molecular motors kinesin-1 and dynein [<46>], thus facilitating anterograde and retrograde transport along the microtubular network [<50>,<51>]. The decrease in tubulin acetylation and increased HDAC6 observed in patients with AD and other tauopathies is indicative of a disrupted microtubular network, which would be expected to contribute to the pathophysiological changes associated with disease progression [<50>,<52>,<53>]. Another recent report identified a decrease in microtubule stability in rTg4510 mice [<54>], and also verified that treatment with the microtubule-stabilizing compound epothilone D (EpoD) decreased tau burden and cognitive deficits [<54>]. Zhang and colleagues [<55>] also reported that treatment with EpoD not only effectively decreased tau pathology in another tau transgenic mouse model (PS19 mice), but also increased axonal microtubular density. The improvement of microtubular stability by EpoD subsequently resulted in improved axonal transport and cognitive performance as assessed by a battery of behavioral tests [<55>]. Given that HDAC6 inhibition similarly augments axonal transport through enhanced tubulin acetylation, these findings suggest that reduced HDAC6 activity would also decrease tau burden and cognitive deficits in tauopathy.The coordinated regulation of HDAC6-mediated tubulin acetylation and tau acetylation on KXGS motifs may allow for tight regulation of microtubule dynamics and axonal transport. While tubulin acetylation is a marker of microtubule stability [<56>], increased tau acetylation may allow tau to dissociate from stabilized microtubules, providing molecular motors greater access to microtubules and facilitating axonal transport. The dissociation of tau and tubulin under conditions of enhanced microtubule stability is supported by a recent study employing FRET technology and live cell imaging to monitor the tau/tubulin interaction [<57>]. Conversely, conditions of heightened HDAC6 activity presumably lead to enhanced deacetylation of both tubulin and tau, which may promote tau-microtubule interactions, leading to increased microtubule stability. Given that phosphorylation, which prevents acetylation, within KXGS motifs has also been reported to release tau from microtubules [<36>], this event would be expected to uncouple the coordinated regulation of tubulin and tau acetylation, further contributing to the pathogenicity of this particular p-tau species. Overall, these results further speak to the complexity associated with the biology of the tau protein and underline how minute, molecular dysfunctions can contribute to the tau pathology observed in patients with AD and other tauopathies. Moreover, these studies also highlight the pressing need to better understand tau biology under physiological as well as pathological conditions. There is now considerable evidence supporting the trans-cellular propagation and seeding of tau pathology in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, ultimately demonstrating that extracellular tau filaments can be internalized by cells and function as seeds for the assembly of intracellular filaments [<58>-<63>]. While the precise mechanism(s) underlying trans-neuronal tau propagation has yet to be elucidated, recent work is beginning to provide insight into this pathway. Wu and colleagues [<64>] observe internalization of misfolded tau at the level of both dendritic and axonal terminals in neurons, after which pathologic tau species can be transported in either the antero- or retrograde direction, thereby leading to the spreading of pathology. In addition, injection of brain material from mice that express human mutant P301S tau into transgenic mice expressing human wild-type tau (ALZ17 model) was sufficient to induce tau pathology not only within, but also adjacent to, the injection site along anatomically connected pathways [<58>]. Furthermore, injection of brain extracts from patients with different tauopathies into either ALZ17 or non-transgenic mice was not only sufficient to drive inclusion formation, but actually effectively reproduced the classic hallmark lesions of the specific tauopathy characteristic of the inoculating brain extract [<65>]. These studies provide additional support for the concept that pathologically altered tau species possess a remarkable self-propagating and seeding capacity, and also indicate that seeding-competent tau species are somehow different and distinct across the class of tauopathies, such that the inoculating material acts as an exact template in the new host. The specific characteristics of pathological tau species that define and determine seeding capacity remain to be identified, and could be the result of a precise pattern of post-translational modifications that differentially impact conformation of the tau molecule and ultimately determine aggregate structure. Our recent findings, which demonstrate that acetylation within tau’s KXGS motifs generates a tau species that fails to polymerize [<11>], suggests that augmenting acetylation of the KXGS motifs would also decrease tau seeding capacity. We review here the rationale supporting the utilization of HDAC6 inhibition to enhance tau acetylation as a novel therapeutic strategy for tauopathies. HDAC6 inhibitors simultaneously promote acetylation and prevent phosphorylation of tau on KXGS motifs, thereby interfering with tau’s propensity to aggregate. Decreasing HDAC6 activity also enhances microtubule stability and transport, which is expected to further stimulate neuronal function."
PMC4075151_4,"As HDAC6 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for oncology indications, data will soon be available to assess the safety of pharmacologic modulation of HDAC6 in humans, which could expedite their repurposing for other diseases  Although additional research is needed to fully elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways associated with the neuroprotective consequences of HDAC6 inhibition, it is becoming increasingly apparent that modulating HDAC6 activity may offer a very promising avenue for the treatment of AD and associated tauopathies. This article is part of a series on Tau-based therapeutic strategies, edited by Leonard Petrucelli. Other articles in this series can be found at http://alzres.com/series/tau_therapeutics.

The authors declare that they have no competing interests. The identification of tau protein as a major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles spurred considerable effort devoted to identifying and validating pathways through which therapeutics may alleviate tau burden in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy associated with sport- and military-related injuries. Most tau-based therapeutic strategies have previously focused on modulating tau phosphorylation, given that tau species present within neurofibrillary tangles are hyperphosphorylated on a number of different residues. However, the recent discovery that tau is modified by acetylation necessitates additional research to provide greater mechanistic insight into the spectrum of physiological consequences of tau acetylation, which may hold promise as a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we discuss recent findings evaluating tau acetylation in the context of previously accepted notions regarding tau biology and pathophysiology. We also examine the evidence demonstrating the neuroprotective and beneficial consequences of inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)6, a tau deacetylase, including its effect on microtubule stabilization. We also discuss the rationale for pharmacologically modulating HDAC6 in tau-based pathologies as a novel therapeutic strategy. ."
PMC3830748_0,"Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). The neuropathology of LRRK2-related PD is heterogeneous and can include aberrant tau phosphorylation or neurofibrillary tau pathology. Recently, LRRK2 has been shown to phosphorylate tau in vitro; however, the major epitopes phosphorylated by LRRK2 and the physiological or pathogenic consequences of these modifications in vivo are unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we identified multiple sites on recombinant tau that are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro, including pT149 and pT153, which are phospho-epitopes that to date have been largely unexplored. Importantly, we demonstrate that expression of transgenic LRRK2 in a mouse model of tauopathy increased the aggregation of insoluble tau and its phosphorylation at T149, T153, T205, and S199/S202/T205 epitopes. These findings indicate that tau can be a LRRK2 substrate and that this interaction can enhance salient features of human disease.

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant and sporadic cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD) [<12>, <51>, <60>, <78>]. The functions of LRRK2 are still largely unknown (reviewed in [<6>]), but aberrations in its kinase activity are thought to lead to pathogenesis [<3>, <9>, <21>, <31>, <33>, <67>, <74>]. Affected carriers of LRRK2 mutations are generally clinically indistinguishable from individuals with idiopathic PD and primarily present with Lewy body pathology [<3>, <19>, <26>, <61>], but neuropathology is pleomorphic and often includes hyperphosphorylated tau protein inclusions [<10>, <17>, <18>, <43>, <55>, <58>, <61>, <71>, <75>].Tau is a soluble protein that binds tubulin to promote microtubule (MT) assembly and support neuronal function (reviewed in [<47>]). While normal tau function is regulated by phosphorylation, certain phospho-epitopes are considered pathogenic [<22>] in tauopathies—neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (reviewed in [<68>]). Tauopathies include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Pick’s disease (PiD), and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 with mutations in the tau gene (FTDP-17t), but tau inclusions are often observed in PD brains as well (reviewed in [<32>]). Furthermore, tau is also present in Lewy bodies in familial and sporadic PD [<14>, <30>]. Although FTDP-17t can result from mutations in the gene encoding tau [<28>, <54>, <69>], the cause of most tauopathies remains unknown. Given this, identifying tau kinases and determining their involvement in tau pathogenesis are vital to therapeutic targeting of tauopathies.The appearance of hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau in the brain of some individuals with LRRK2 mutations (reviewed in [<56>]) has led to the suggestion that LRRK2 may be a novel kinase for tau. Several studies, which demonstrated altered tau phosphorylation in transgenic mice expressing mutant LRRK2, support this hypothesis [<40>, <41>, <46>]. In addition, recent in vitro and cell culture studies suggest that LRRK2 may phosphorylate tau [<35>, <71>]. If LRRK2 is a novel tau kinase, it is possible that it may phosphorylate novel tau epitopes; however, published studies have focused on a subset of the phospho-epitopes that are frequently associated with human tauopathies. Furthermore, an interaction between LRRK2 and tau has not been directly demonstrated in vivo and it is unclear if such an interaction could influence tau pathologies.In the current report, we demonstrate that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates tau in vitro and use mass spectrometry (MS) to identify specific tau epitopes that are targets of LRRK2 in vitro. We demonstrate that LRRK2 preferentially phosphorylates tau at T149 and to a lesser extent T153—epitopes that have been largely unexplored by the tau field. We show these epitopes to be hyperphosphorylated in a range of human tauopathies and in individuals with the G2109S LRRK2 mutation using our novel antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate that human wild-type LRRK2 expression in a mouse model of tauopathy enhances tau aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation—critical features of human tauopathy. Recombinant forms of GST-LRRK2 (970–2,527) were purchased from Invitrogen.

Briefly, rabbits were immunized with the pT149 peptide (DGKpTKIATPRGAAC) or pT153 peptide (DGKTKIApTPRGAAC), affinity purified with the same peptide, and negatively absorbed against the non-phosphorylated peptide (DGKTKIATPRGAAC). We used polyclonal tau antibodies E1 (specific for amino acids 19–33 of human tau) [<11>], pT205 (Abcam), pT212 (Anaspec), pS214 (Invitrogen) [<70>], 17025 anti-tau (provided by Dr. Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA); and monoclonal tau antibodies CP13 (specific for pS202 in tau), PHF1 (specific for pS396/S404 in tau), and MC1 [pre-PHF conformational epitope (7–9 and 326–330)] (provided by Dr. Peter Davies, The Einstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA), AT8 (specific for pS199/pS202/pT205 in tau), AT100 (specific for pT212/S214 in tau), and AT270 (specific for pT181 in tau) (Innogenetics, Fisher Scientific)."

Samples were resolved onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and incorporation of phosphate was determined by autoradiography and/or immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. As described above, 10 μM of 0N3R tau was subjected to overnight in vitro phosphorylation by either G2019S LRRK2 or the kinase dead (KD) LRRK2 mutant D1994K. Samples were resolved onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then excised and washed in 50 % acetonitrile and water [<5>]. To maximize sequence coverage, three equivalently loaded and excised gel bands of 0N3R tau were separately digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin or GluC. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of modified 0N3R tau was performed as a service by the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource Laboratory (Cambridge, MA, USA). Peptide sequence analysis of each digestion mixture was performed by microcapillary reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC–MS/MS) on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). The Orbitrap repetitively surveyed an m/z range from 395 to 1,600, while data-dependent MS/MS spectra on the twenty most abundant ions in each survey scan were acquired in the linear ion trap. MS/MS spectra were acquired with relative collision energy of 30 %, 2.5-Da isolation width, and recurring ions dynamically excluded for 60 s. Preliminary sequencing of peptides was facilitated with the SEQUEST algorithm [<15>] with a 30 ppm mass tolerance against the human subset of the Uniprot Knowledgebase supplemented with a database of common laboratory contaminants, concatenated to a reverse decoy database. Using a custom version of Proteomics Browser Suite (PBS v.2.7, ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were accepted with mass error <2.5 ppm and score thresholds to attain an estimated false discovery rate of ~1 %. Data-sets for all digest results were combined in silico, culled of minor contaminant PSMs, and re-searched with SEQUEST algorithm against the 0N3R tau sequence without taking into account enzyme specificity and with differential modifications of phosphorylated tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. The discovery of phosphopeptides and subsequent manual confirmation of their MS/MS spectra were facilitated using in-house versions of programs MuQuest, GraphMod, and FuzzyIons (PBS, ThermoFisher Scientific). Recombinant C-terminal fragment of human 3R tau [C′ Tau] corresponding to amino acids 244–441 minus amino acids 275–305 that would be present in 2N4R tau human tau was phosphorylated with recombinant glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) (New England BioLabs Inc, Ipswich, MA, USA) (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 200 μM ATP, 1 mg/ml tau and 20,000 units enzyme in 50 μl) for 1 h at 30 °C. Controls included similar reactions without the kinase. 100 ng of each synthetic peptide or 500 ng of tau recombinant protein diluted in 100 μl of water was absorbed per well of 96-well EIA/RIA Corning plates (Corning, NY, USA). The plates were extensively washed with PBS and blocked with PBS/5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary antibodies as indicated were diluted in PBS/5 % FBS and incubated on the plates. After extensive washes with PBS, plates were incubated with either anti-mouse antibody conjugated to HRP or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP diluted in PBS/5 % FBS. Plates were again extensively washed with PBS and reactions were carried out with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMS) reagents (KPL, Gaithersburg, NY, USA). The reactions were terminated by adding 0.2 M HCl and optical density was measured at OD450 using a Multiskan Plus plate reader (ThermoFisher). Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified medium with high glucose (4.5 g/l) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine. Cells were plated onto 6-well plates and transfected at approximately 30 % confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were maintained for 48 h after transfection. Cells were harvested and lysed in 3 % SDS/50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8 and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent and BSA as the standard (Pierce, Fisher Scientific). Experiments were performed in duplicate. Mice were housed and treated in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use committee and the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use committee. Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free facility on a 12 h light/dark cycle with water and food provided ad libitum.The parental TauP301L responder line and parental tTA activator line were generated and maintained on an FVB and 129/S6 background, respectively, as previously described [<65>]. Bigenic rTg4510 mice have forebrain-focused expression of P301L transgenic tau. The parental bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-LRRK2 mice, maintained on an FVB background, contain the entire human LRRK2 gene including regulatory sequences and LRRK2 expression is driven by the human LRRK2 promoter, as previously described [<46>]. Mice from the TauP301L responder line were crossed with mice from the BAC-LRRK2 mouse line for one generation to obtain LRRK2.TauP301L responder mice on an FVB background. LRRK2.TauP301L responder mice were then crossed with mice from the tTA activator line to obtain the resultant F1 LRRK2/TauP301L mice on a 50 % FVB, 50 % 129S background, the same as the original rTg4510 mouse model [<65>]. All mice in this study were harvested at 5.5 months of age when mature cortical tangles and hippocampal neurodegeneration are detectable in TauP301L only animals. We harvested 10 mice per group, half male and half female, for the four genotypes of interest (non-transgenic, LRRK2, TauP301L, and LRRK2/TauP301L). One male LRRK2/TauP301L mouse did not overexpress LRRK2 (as determined by western blotting) and was excluded from all studies. The sarkosyl-preparation (see protocol below) of one female TauP301L mouse had extremely high tau aggregation via western blotting and was identified by Grubb’s analysis to be an outlier. As this may have been a tissue preparation error, all western blot data from this mouse were excluded from the final results. All mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation to maintain the brain biochemistry by avoiding anesthesia-induced tau changes. Brains were quickly removed, cut down the midline, and one brain half was drop fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 h for immunohistochemical analysis and the other brain half was immediately homogenized to preserve the LRRK2 protein. Brains were homogenized in 6 volumes of homogenate buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8."
PMC3830748_2,"0, 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 % protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 % phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)]  For LRRK2 analysis, homogenates were centrifuged at 150,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent and BSA as the standard. For tau analysis, the brain homogenate was diluted to 10 volumes using Tris-buffered saline and subjected to sarkosyl fractionation as previously described [<65>]. Specifically, 200 μl of 10× homogenate was centrifuged at 150,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant, which contains soluble tau species, was collected and protein concentration was determined as described above. Pellets were homogenized in 3 volumes (600 μl) of Buffer B [10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 0.8 M NaCl, 10 % Sucrose, 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM PMSF] and centrifuged at 150,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and incubated with 1 % sarkosyl (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 150,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain a sarkosyl-soluble supernatant and sarkosyl-insoluble pellet. The sarkosyl-insoluble pellet, which contains the biochemical equivalent of neurofibrillary tangles, was re-suspended in 20 μl TE buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA]. For in vitro and cell culture experiments, equal amounts of protein samples were loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 5 % non-fat milk powder, and incubated overnight with 1182 LRRK2-specific antibody [<72>], anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), or anti-tau antibody (17025) in TBS/5 % non-fat milk powder. Membranes were also incubated overnight with pT149 or pT153 tau specific antibodies in TBS/5 % BSA. Each incubation was followed by goat anti-mouse conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-rabbit HRP (Cell Signaling Technology), and immunoreactivity was detected using chemiluminescent reagent (NEN) followed by exposure on X-ray film.For analysis of LRRK2 protein in mouse brain tissue, 50 μg of protein was diluted in NuPAGE LDS-sample buffer with NuPAGE reducing agent (Invitrogen), boiled for 3 min at 95 °C, loaded onto 26-well 3–8 % Tris–Acetate gels (Invitrogen), separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred in NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen) to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Fisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5 % non-fat milk powder in TBS with 0.1 % Triton X-100 (TBS-T) and then incubated overnight in primary antibody diluted in 5 % non-fat milk powder in TBS-T at 4 °C. For tau protein analysis from mouse brain, 5 μg of the soluble fraction or 3 μl of the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction was diluted in Novex Tris–glycine SDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen) with β-mercaptoethanol, heat denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, loaded onto 26-well 10 % Tris–glycine gels (Invitrogen), separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred in CAPS transfer buffer (Sigma) to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBS-T with 5 % non-fat milk powder and incubated overnight with antibody in TBS-T/5 % non-fat milk powder, except for pT149 and pT153 tau antibodies, which were in TBS-T/5 % BSA. All membranes were washed 3 times in TBS-T, incubated with either goat anti-mouse HRP or goat anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature and washed again 3 times in TBS-T. Membranes were developed using Western Lightning Plus (Perkin Elmer) and imaged using a FluorChem E System (ProteinSimple). The relative levels of immunoreactivity were determined by densitometry using the software AlphaView SA (ProteinSimple). Fixed mouse brains were paraffin embedded and cut into 5 μm sagittal sections. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on at least two brain sections from each mouse to align all brains to approximately 1.3 mm lateral to the midline using a mouse brain atlas [<52>]. Immunohistochemistry with the Dako Universal Autostainer with DAKO Envision + HRP system (Dako) was performed with the following antibodies: pT149 tau, pT153 tau, AT8, AT270, CP13, and MC1. Stained slides were digitally scanned using a ScanScope XT scanner and were analyzed using ImageScope version 11.2.0.780 software (Aperio). Positive pixel count algorithms were created to measure the staining density of the secondary antibody, specifically chromogen 3,3′ diaminobenzidine. The cortex of each animal was traced and analyzed using these algorithms and the burden was expressed as a percentage of immunostained pixels to total area. Sections that had tears or other artifacts were not included in the analysis. Paraffin embedded sections were processed for immunohistochemistry as above for mice from 3R + 4R tauopathy (5 AD—average age: 90 ± 6 years; 4 women; median Braak NFT Stage: VI; 2 with concurrent diffuse cortical Lewy bodies), 4R tauopathy (4 PSP and 1 CBD—average age: 77 ± 7 years; 4 women; median Braak NFT Stage: III), 3R tauopathy (2 PiD—average age: 68 ± 6 years; 1 woman; median Braak NFT Stage: III), and mutant LRRK2 carriers (4 G2019S—average age: 76 ± 5 years; 2 women; Braak NFT Stage: 0–V). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Grubb’s analysis was used to identify outliers in the western blot analysis of sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error mean unless otherwise noted. Analysis of two groups was performed with an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test while analysis of multiple groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons test (α = 0.05). Western blot and immunohistochemical data from male and female TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mice were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with genotype and sex as independent variables. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 software (GraphPad Software) and in all cases, P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To determine if LRRK2 directly phosphorylates tau, recombinant tau (2N4R) was incubated with multiple forms of recombinant GST-LRRK2 (970–2,527) and incorporation of γ-[32P] ATP was determined by autoradiography. Both wild-type (WT) and mutant (G2019S, I2020T and R1441C) LRRK2 phosphorylated recombinant tau in vitro (Fig. <1>a). Although we analyzed three different LRRK2 mutants, each of which has been implicated in familial PD with neurofibrillary tangle pathology, G2019S LRRK2 yielded the highest level of tau phosphorylation. Further, tau phosphorylation was largely ablated when using the LRRK2 kinase dead/impaired (KD) D1994K mutant (Fig. <1>a), indicating that LRRK2 directly phosphorylated tau in vitro. We then examined the ability of mutant LRRK2 to phosphorylate different tau isoforms that contain alternatively spliced N-terminal (0, 1 or 2 N) and C-terminal MT-binding domains (3R or 4R). Recombinant GST-G2019S LRRK2 (970–2,527) phosphorylated all forms of tau regardless of isoform or the presence of FTDP-17t-associated mutations (E342V, P301L, P301S and R406W) (Fig. <1>b). These findings were confirmed using full-length G2019S LRRK2 (Supplemental Fig. 1). rhetorical Fig. 1 Wild-type and mutant LRRK2 phosphorylates tau in vitro. a Wild-type (WT) and mutant LRRK2 proteins directly phosphorylate 2N4R tau in vitro.

These findings were confirmed using full-length G2019S LRRK2 (Supplemental Fig. 1). To identify the tau residues that are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro, we performed MS analyses of tau (0N3R) phosphorylated with GST-G2019S LRRK2 (970–2,527). Using the shortest tau isoform with the highest kinase active LRRK2, we had the greatest likelihood of complete coverage. We obtained >99 % sequence coverage from the 0N3R isoform and identified multiple tau residues phosphorylated by G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. <2>a), with T149, T153, T169, T205, T263 and T231 identified as the major phosphorylation sites by LRRK2 (Supplemental Table 1). These modifications were not present in identical MS analysis of 0N3R tau incubated with KD LRRK2. To parse the sites that were preferentially phosphorylated by LRRK2, we incubated various forms of recombinant LRRK2 with synthetic peptides that spanned short regions of tau containing 1–3 potential tau phospho-epitopes (Supplemental Table 2) and quantified the resultant phosphorylation. G2019S-LRRK2 showed the greatest phosphorylation of the Tau-A (KKAKGADGKTKIATPRGAAPPGQK) and Tau-B (REPKKVAVVRTPPKSPSSAKSRL) peptides, with the WT Tau-B peptide phosphorylated 83 ± 1.7 % (P < 0.001) less than the WT Tau-A peptide (Fig. <2>b) as assessed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons test. The other peptides demonstrated minimal phosphorylation. These data were consistent with the MS data, which showed that pT149 and pT153 peptides were among the most abundant phosphorylated products resulting from LRRK2-mediated tau phosphorylation. Alanine substitution to block site-specific LRRK2 phosphorylation of the Tau-A peptide reduced phosphorylation by 93 ± 1.2 % (T149A; P < 0.0001) and 21 ± 1.2 % (T153A; P < 0.001) compared to WT Tau-A (Fig. <2>b), indicating that tau T149 and T153 were primary and secondary targets, respectively, of LRRK2-directed phosphorylation.

The K
m of WT and G2019S LRRK2 for the Tau-A peptide was determined to be ~170 μM, which is similar to that of LRRKtide, the most robust and commonly used LRRK2 substrate in kinetic studies [<1>, <9>, <31>, <48>]. Furthermore, like LRRKtide, the V

To test the pathological relevance of pT149 and pT153, we performed immunohistochemistry on brain tissue from different human tauopathies using our pT149 and pT153 tau antibodies. Both antibodies recognized neurofibrillary pathology in AD (Fig. <3>d, left panels), including neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites in senile plaques. Further, both antibodies stained neurofibrillary tangles and tufted astrocytes (Fig. <3>d, middle-left panels) in PSP, as well as Pick bodies in PiD (Fig. <3>d, middle-right panels). Moreover, the pT149 and pT153 antibodies stained pathological tau in patients with the G2019S LRRK2 mutation (Fig. <3>d, right panels). In addition to the tangle pathology previously reported for G2019S mutant carriers, our antibodies identified tau surrounding Lewy bodies in the brainstem (Fig. <3>e). These results indicate that in addition to G2019S-LRRK2 carriers, tau hyperphosphorylation at T149 and T153 occurs in a range of human tauopathies, including so-called 4R-tauopathies, 3R-tauopathies and 3R + 4R tauopathies, and that phosphorylation of these epitopes is linked to pathology, since no staining was detected in unaffected brains or unaffected brain regions in tauopathies (data not shown). To determine, if LRRK2 could modify the development of tauopathy in vivo, we crossed human WT LRRK2 BAC mice that do not have an overt phenotype or pathological abnormalities (including evidence of tau pathology) [<46>], with rTg4510 mice that express human mutant (P301L) 0N4R tau [<65>] to generate mice that expressed both transgenes (LRRK2/TauP301L) (see breeding scheme in Supplemental Fig. 2). LRRK2 BAC mice showed the highest expression of transgenic LRRK2 in the hippocampus as well as high expression in the cortex [<46>]. These regions overlap well with the forebrain-focused transgenic tau expression that is conditionally driven by a CAMKIIα-tTA transgene in the rTg4510 mice [<65>], reducing the likelihood that an interaction between the proteins would be missed due to disparate expression profiles. The forebrain of 5.5-month-old rTg4510 mice, hereafter termed TauP301L, has been shown previously to have insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss [<59>, <65>]. We, therefore, examined LRRK2/TauP301L mice at 5.5 months of age for alterations in this well-characterized pathology.Initially, we confirmed that all LRRK2/TauP301L experimental mice expressed the LRRK2 (Fig. <4>a, b) and tau (Fig. <4>c, d) transgenes. Soluble tau fractions typically contain normal tau species that run at ~55 kDa which can be used to determine equal levels of expression across mice. Human LRRK2 expression in LRRK2/TauP301L mice did not affect human tau levels in the normal (soluble) fraction (Fig. <4>c, d) when compared to TauP301L mice alone, ensuring that any effects on tauopathy in the LRRK2/TauP301L mice would not be due to expression artifact. With a panel of phospho-specific tau antibodies, we then analyzed soluble tau via western blotting for phosphorylation at sites that we confirmed to be directly phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro (T149 and T153) and/or identified by our initial MS results (T181, T212 and T205). We also included epitopes that are associated with human disease and were not identified by our MS analysis (S202, S214, and S396/S404). We did not detect any changes in the phosphorylation of the ~55 kDa soluble tau in LRRK2/TauP301L mice when compared to the TauP301L mice with any antibody utilized (Supplemental Fig. 3). We and others have previously reported that species of higher molecular weight tau can be observed in the soluble fraction, potentially representing some species of aggregated tau [<39>, <63>, <64>]."

Comparison of this band between both cohorts (P = 0.17) failed, however, to reach our 0.05 threshold for significance. An important feature of human tauopathy and a subset of mutant LRRK2 carriers is the aggregation of tau. In tauopathies, tau aggregation is associated with the shift of tau into the biochemically abnormal, sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. We, therefore, examined the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of brains from LRRK2/TauP301L mice by western blot analysis to determine if LRRK2 enhances tau aggregation compared to TauP301L mice. Using the phospho-independent, human tau antibody, E1, we found that insoluble, aggregated tau levels were ~3.5 times higher in LRRK2/TauP301L compared to TauP301L mice (Fig. <5>a, b). Insoluble tau from both LRRK2/TauP301L and TauP301L mice migrated primarily as a ~64 kDa band—a species that we have previously shown to correlate with the presence of NFTs in tau transgenic mice [<39>]. Using a two-way ANOVA (genotype × sex), we then determined that the levels of sarkosyl-insoluble human tau in TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mice were affected by both genotype [F(1, 14) = 34, P < 0.0001] and sex [F(1, 14) = 34, P < 0.0001], and that there was also a significant interaction between both factors [F(1, 14) = 14, P < 0.01]. To help interpret these findings, we analyzed females and males separately and found that female LRRK2/TauP301L mice had approximately 3.6 times more insoluble tau compared to female TauP301L mice (P < 0.001) (Supplemental Fig. 4a), and that male LRRK2/TauP301L mice had 2.8 times more insoluble tau compare to male TauP301L mice (P < 0.05) (Supplemental Fig. 4b). rhetorical Fig. 5 LRRK2/TauP301L mice have elevated insoluble, hyperphosphorylated tau compared to TauP301L. Western blot analyses of the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of whole brain lysates from TauP301L only and LRRK2/TauP301L mice. a Representative immunoblot probed with an antibody (E1) that recognizes human tau, regardless of phosphorylation state, shows significantly more aggregated (insoluble) human tau in LRRK2/TauP301L compared to TauP301L only mice as measured by (b) densitometry. Note the ~64 kDa species of tau (a) that we have previously shown to be a highly aggregated, hyperphosphorylated form of 0N4R tau [<64>]. c–l Levels of insoluble tau phosphorylated at T149 (c), T153 (d), T181 (AT270) (e), S202 (CP13) (f), T205 (g), S199/S202/T205 (AT8) (h), T212 (i), S214 (j), T212/S214 (AT100) (k), and S396/S404 (PHF1) (l), as measured by densitometry (Supplemental Fig. 6), were adjusted by levels of human tau in the insoluble fraction (a-b) to distinguish specific phospho-epitopes that are enriched in the insoluble fraction. Phosphorylation of insoluble tau is increased at T149, T205 and S199/S202/T205 and decreased at T181 when normalized to the amount of tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction.

Summary of two-way ANOVA found in Table <1> An important feature of human tauopathy and a subset of mutant LRRK2 carriers is the aggregation of tau. In tauopathies, tau aggregation is associated with the shift of tau into the biochemically abnormal, sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. We, therefore, examined the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of brains from LRRK2/TauP301L mice by western blot analysis to determine if LRRK2 enhances tau aggregation compared to TauP301L mice.

To help interpret these findings, we analyzed females and males separately and found that female LRRK2/TauP301L mice had approximately 3."
PMC3830748_6,"6 times more insoluble tau compared to female TauP301L mice (P < 0 001) (Supplemental Fig. 4a), and that male LRRK2/TauP301L mice had 2.8 times more insoluble tau compare to male TauP301L mice (P < 0.05) (Supplemental Fig. 4b). We then analyzed the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mouse brains using our panel of phospho-tau antibodies and found that LRRK2 increased phosphorylation of insoluble tau at all epitopes that were examined (Supplemental Figs. 5 and 6). To determine if the elevated levels of phosphorylated tau were simply driven by the overall increase of aggregated tau in the insoluble fraction, we normalized the densitometry of each phospho-tau antibody by the densitometry of sarkosyl-insoluble human tau for each mouse. When normalized for the amount of insoluble tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, analysis by two-way ANOVA (genotype × sex) revealed a main genotype effect with increased phosphorylation of T149, T205, and S199/S202/T205 (Fig. <5>c, g, h; Table <1>) and decreased phosphorylation of T181 in LRRK2/TauP301L mice compared to TauP301L mice (Fig. <5>e; Table <1>). Phosphorylation of T153 in LRRK2/TauP301L mice compared to TauP301L mice (P = 0.07) did not reach our significance threshold (Fig. <5>d; Table <1>) and phosphorylation of S202, T212, S214, T212/S214 and S396/S404 was unchanged by co-expression of LRRK2 in TauP301L mice (S202: P = 0.62; T212: P = 0.32; S214: P = 0.90; T212/S214: P = 0.63; and S396/S404: P = 0.40) (Fig. <5>f, i–l; Table <1>). In addition, this analysis revealed a main sex effect for pT181 (AT270), S199/S202/T205 (AT8) and S396/S404 (PHF1), but not the other epitopes examined (see statistical summary in Table <1>).

In tauopathies, tau aggregation is associated with the shift of tau into the biochemically abnormal, sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. We, therefore, examined the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of brains from LRRK2/TauP301L mice by western blot analysis to determine if LRRK2 enhances tau aggregation compared to TauP301L mice. Using the phospho-independent, human tau antibody, E1, we found that insoluble, aggregated tau levels were ~3.5 times higher in LRRK2/TauP301L compared to TauP301L mice (Fig. <5>a, b). Insoluble tau from both LRRK2/TauP301L and TauP301L mice migrated primarily as a ~64 kDa band—a species that we have previously shown to correlate with the presence of NFTs in tau transgenic mice [<39>]. Using a two-way ANOVA (genotype × sex), we then determined that the levels of sarkosyl-insoluble human tau in TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mice were affected by both genotype [F(1, 14) = 34, P < 0.0001] and sex [F(1, 14) = 34, P < 0.0001], and that there was also a significant interaction between both factors [F(1, 14) = 14, P < 0.01]. To help interpret these findings, we analyzed females and males separately and found that female LRRK2/TauP301L mice had approximately 3.6 times more insoluble tau compared to female TauP301L mice (P < 0.001) (Supplemental Fig. 4a), and that male LRRK2/TauP301L mice had 2.8 times more insoluble tau compare to male TauP301L mice (P < 0.05) (Supplemental Fig. 4b). We then analyzed the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mouse brains using our panel of phospho-tau antibodies and found that LRRK2 increased phosphorylation of insoluble tau at all epitopes that were examined (Supplemental Figs. 5 and 6). To determine if the elevated levels of phosphorylated tau were simply driven by the overall increase of aggregated tau in the insoluble fraction, we normalized the densitometry of each phospho-tau antibody by the densitometry of sarkosyl-insoluble human tau for each mouse. When normalized for the amount of insoluble tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, analysis by two-way ANOVA (genotype × sex) revealed a main genotype effect with increased phosphorylation of T149, T205, and S199/S202/T205 (Fig. <5>c, g, h; Table <1>) and decreased phosphorylation of T181 in LRRK2/TauP301L mice compared to TauP301L mice (Fig. <5>e; Table <1>). Phosphorylation of T153 in LRRK2/TauP301L mice compared to TauP301L mice (P = 0.07) did not reach our significance threshold (Fig. <5>d; Table <1>) and phosphorylation of S202, T212, S214, T212/S214 and S396/S404 was unchanged by co-expression of LRRK2 in TauP301L mice (S202: P = 0.62; T212: P = 0.32; S214: P = 0.90; T212/S214: P = 0.63; and S396/S404: P = 0.40) (Fig. <5>f, i–l; Table <1>). In addition, this analysis revealed a main sex effect for pT181 (AT270), S199/S202/T205 (AT8) and S396/S404 (PHF1), but not the other epitopes examined (see statistical summary in Table <1>). We sought to validate our biochemical studies with neuropathological analysis of tau burden using antibodies that detect specific phosphorylation or conformational tau epitopes. All antibodies identified prominent tau pathology, including neurofibrillary tangles, in the brains of TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mice, which was absent in the LRRK2 only transgenic and non-transgenic (nTg) mice (Fig. <6>). Tau pathology was distributed throughout the cortex and hippocampus of TauP301L and LRRK2/TauP301L mice; however, we focused our assessment on the cortex since neuronal loss within the hippocampus can confound accurate assessment of tau burden at this age. Using two-way ANOVA analysis, we observed significant increases in phosphorylated tau pathology in LRRK2/TauP301L mice with pT149, pT153, CP13, and AT8 immunostaining when compared to TauP301L mice (Figs. <6>, <7>; Table <1>). Although the burden of tau pathology with these antibodies was also significantly influenced by sex, where females had greater burden than males, there was no interaction between the genotype and sex (Fig. <7>; Table <1>). In addition, we observed significant increases in conformationally-abnormal tau in LRRK2/TauP301L mice with MC1 immunostaining when compared to TauP301L mice (Figs. <6>, <7>; Table <1>). Tau burden as assessed with MC1 was also significantly influenced by sex, but there was no interaction between genotype and sex (Table <1>).

No significant difference in tau burden was observed with AT270, irrespective of genotype or sex (Figs. <6>, <7>; Table <1>). In the current study, we combined in vitro, cell culture, and novel transgenic studies to demonstrate that tau is a substrate of LRRK2 and that this interaction promotes tauopathy. We found that recombinant WT and mutant LRRK2 directly phosphorylates tau in kinase assays. As shown previously for other LRRK2 substrates, G2019S LRRK2 yields the greatest levels of tau phosphorylation [<9>, <21>, <31>, <74>]. Our subsequent in vitro studies used G2019S LRRK2 to obtain the highest levels of substrate phosphorylation, thereby reducing the chance that LRRK2-directed phosphorylation of tau would be inadvertently missed. Using MS analysis, we uncovered the tau epitopes that were potentially targeted by LRRK2 phosphorylation. To reduce false positives, MS analysis was performed in parallel with reactions utilizing KD LRRK2, and we further validated subsequent hits using LRRK2 kinase reactions coupled with site directed mutagenesis at identified sites of phosphorylation to block LRRK2 activity. Surprisingly, we identified tau T149 and T153 as a preferential target and a secondary target, respectively, of LRRK2-directed phosphorylation. Although much of our studies focused on mutant LRRK2, we sought to determine if tau could be a substrate of LRRK2 in vivo by generating novel transgenic mice, which expressed human WT LRRK2 and mutant tau. WT LRRK2 mice alone do not develop tau abnormalities and the tau abnormalities observed in mutant LRRK2 mice are modest [<40>, <41>, <46>]. For our LRRK2/TauP301L model, we combined a WT LRRK2 BAC line [<46>] with a TauP301L (rTg4510) model [<65>]. The rTg4510 model represents a well-characterized model, providing a “primed system” in which we could determine if human LRRK2 phosphorylates tau in vivo and if this could influence the development of tauopathy. We demonstrated that human WT LRRK2 expression in a mouse model of tauopathy enhances tau aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation—critical features of human tauopathy.Having identified T149 and T153 on tau as primary targets of direct G2019S LRRK2 phosphorylation in vitro, we then sought to determine the relevance of these sites to human tauopathy. One study has reported that T149 tau is phosphorylated by recombinant CK1δ and GSK-3β kinases [<23>]; however, phosphorylation of T149 has not been studied in vivo or associated with disease. Phosphorylation of T153 has been described in vitro and in cell culture [<23>, <29>, <66>] and one study shows that phospho-T153 (pT153) antibody labels neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain [<2>]. It is still unknown to what extent phosphorylation of T153 is associated with other tauopathies. We created antibodies specific for tau phosphorylated at T149 and at T153, respectively (see “<Materials and methods>”). We then confirmed their specificity in vitro and in cell culture and demonstrated the presence of these phospho-epitopes in neuronal and glial lesions of 3R tauopathies (PiD), 4R tauopathies (PSP) and 3R + 4R tauopathies (AD) and in G2019S-LRRK2 carriers (PD). There was also immunoreactivity in a subset of Lewy bodies, similar to the pattern we previously noted with other antibodies to phospho-tau [<30>]. T149 and T153 are largely unexplored tau epitopes, but it is of interest that they flank a rare variant in tau, A152T, that may be a risk factor for tauopathies such as PSP [<7>, <34>, <36>]. LRRK2 is not known to play a role in tauopathies beyond its involvement in PD, but it is possible that rare genetic variants in LRRK2, including those that confer risk to PD [<16>, <60>, <62>] or have yet to be uncovered, could play a role in tauopathies. The pT149 and pT153 immunostaining in these diverse cases of human tauopathy suggests that further studies on the role of LRRK2 in these disorders could be informative.No changes to tau levels or phosphorylation were observed in the soluble fraction of LRRK2/TauP301L mice compared to TauP301L mice."
PMC3830748_8,"Initial analysis of the insoluble fraction revealed increased phosphorylation of all epitopes examined in LRRK2/TauP301L mice  This was not surprising, however, as there was approximately three times more tau in the insoluble fraction of LRRK2/TauP301L mice. To account for the significant difference of insoluble tau in TauP301L only and LRRK2/TauP301L mice, it was necessary to adjust the phospho-tau levels to the total amount of insoluble tau present to fully assess if there were specific phosphorylation changes associated with LRRK2 overexpression. We found that co-expression of LRRK2 in TauP301L mice selectively increased insoluble tau phosphorylation at sites identified in vitro as being directly phosphorylated by LRRK2, T149 and T153, as well as the T205 and S199/S202/T205 epitopes. Interestingly, our in vitro results were performed in the context of soluble tau; whereas, the elevated phosphorylation in the mice in the presence of LRRK2 was only in insoluble tau. These data suggest that LRRK2-associated phosphorylation may be able to trigger the shift of soluble tau into the insoluble fraction. Davies et al. [<13>] have isolated a substantial amount of LRRK2 in the insoluble protein fraction using a Triton and SDS preparation and demonstrated that LRRK2 is not exclusively soluble in WT rodents or in humans. This could support a potential interaction of LRRK2 and tau in LRRK2/TauP301L mice as tau switches from its highly soluble (normal) state to the insoluble protein that is found in tauopathy. Alternatively, filamentous tau may be a better substrate for LRRK2 compared to the soluble tau. Neuropathological analysis revealed increased tau burden using antibodies for tau phosphorylated at T149, T153, S202, and pS199/S202/T205, largely replicating what we observed in our biochemical analysis. By both biochemical and histological analyses enhanced phosphorylation was detected by the AT8 antibody that recognizes a triple epitope (pS199/S202/S205). It is possible that these findings are due to increased phosphorylation at S202 or T205 that was observed with antibodies that specifically detect those singular epitopes.Our in vitro and in vivo findings support that T149 tau is the primary target of direct LRRK2 phosphorylation and suggests that T153 may be a secondary target. Our MS studies identified T205 as a potential LRRK2 phosphorylation site which was not validated in our subsequent in vitro work utilizing synthetic peptides for this region; therefore, the increased phosphorylation of insoluble tau at T205 and the combined S199/S202/T205 epitope, recognized by the AT8 antibody, may indicate an indirect mechanism by which LRRK2 increases phosphorylation of these specific tau epitopes in vivo. Alternatively, phosphorylation of T205 may require unique modeling of secondary and tertiary structure, and therefore be a better substrate for LRRK2 in vivo than it is in vitro. In addition, microtubules or other co-factors may act as scaffold to bring tau and LRRK2 together, allowing LRRK2 to phosphorylate tau at additional epitopes [<35>]. LRRK2 might also directly phosphorylate other tau kinases and enhance their ability to target tau [<49>, <76>], including AKT, GSK-3β, and members of the MAPK family, which have been implicated downstream of LRRK2 activity [<4>, <20>, <42>, <44>, <53>, <57>]. In addition, LRRK2 phosphorylation of its main target epitopes (i.e., T149) may have the ability to enhance phosphorylation of additional epitopes by other tau kinases; such cooperation has been noted with other phospho-tau epitopes [<45>, <77>]. Further experiments examining the interaction between LRRK2-associated tau phosphorylation and tau phosphorylation by known tau kinases are required to test this.For proteins that are highly phosphorylated, such as tau, it is common to find redundancy of phosphorylation of a given residue by multiple kinases. For example, S202 tau has been shown to be phosphorylated by at least 8 different kinases, including CK1 (reviewed in [<37>]). CK1δ has also been shown to phosphorylate T149 tau in vitro [<23>] and interestingly, both CK1δ and LRRK2 have been shown to phosphorylate the disease-related α-synuclein protein at S129 [<50>, <57>]. Given this, it would not be surprising if both kinases could phosphorylate tau at the same epitope. In Drosophila, LRRK2 has been proposed to increase tau phosphorylation at T212 in a GSK-3β dependent manner [<42>]. In our LRRK2/TauP301L mice, we did not detect increased phosphorylation of tau at T212 nor at S396/S404, a second epitope phosphorylated by GSK-3β [<38>], indicating that LRRK2 expression in TauP301L mice did not ubiquitously increase phosphorylation of tau epitopes targeted by GSK-3β (reviewed in [<24>]). Surprisingly, we observed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of insoluble tau at T181 in the LRRK2/TauP301L compared to TauP301L mice. Kawakami et al. [<35>] previously reported that LRRK2 did not promote phosphorylation of tau S199/S202/T205 in vitro and instead increased phosphorylation of T181 in cell culture and in vitro, a modification of tau that required the interaction with microtubules. Ujiie et al. [<71>] reported that LRRK2 modestly enhanced T181 phosphorylation in cell culture. The discrepancy between our findings and these reports may arise from differences between constructs or reaction design. Furthermore, the LRRK2/TauP301L mice express mutant tau, which has reduced tubulin binding [<25>, <27>], potentially decreasing our ability to uncover tubulin-dependent LRRK2 phosphorylation of tau.The evolution of toxic tau is a complex event, with no consensus on the biochemical switch from soluble to insoluble tau or functional to dysfunctional species. Our neuropathological analysis of LRRK2/TauP301L mice compared to TauP301L mice revealed elevated immunostaining with the MC1 antibody, which detects tau in an abnormal, disease-relevant conformation [<73>], agreeing with our biochemical findings of increased 64 kDa sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Although our in vitro results suggest that the increase in tauopathy in the LRRK2/TauP301L mice is likely derived from the kinase function of LRRK2, it is possible that in vivo LRRK2 also promotes the aggregation of tau into the insoluble fraction by indirect cellular mechanisms. Other functions such as its regulation of autophagy have been assigned to LRRK2, which may contribute to our in vivo observations. In addition, some findings suggest that LRRK2-mediated tau phosphorylation can inhibit microtubule binding [<35>], which could also promote tau aggregation. Further studies will be required to determine the relative contribution of these alternative mechanisms on tau aggregation.In some cases, we detected an influence of sex as well as genotype on neuropathological and biochemical outcomes in our mouse studies when assessed by two-way ANOVA. Neither transgenic tau nor LRRK2 expression was influenced by sex; therefore, these differences are not easily explained, but they are interesting and could be physiologically important. Curiously, the age-associated cumulative incidence of LRRK2 G2019S PD in Tunisia is gender specific—the median age of onset of female carriers being 5 years younger (in preparation, Matthew J. Farrer). In our lab, we have observed a non-significant trend that female rTg4510 mice have steeper exponential phase of tau pathology than male rTg4510 mice between ~4 and 6 months of age (personal communication, Jada Lewis). This inherent difference may be amplified by LRRK2 influence on tau pathology.Our data, in aggregate, demonstrate that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates tau at T149 and T153 in vitro and the ability of LRRK2 to phosphorylate tau at these sites may underlie its ability to promote tauopathy in our novel mouse model. Our current in vivo studies are the first of their kind and provide compelling evidence that LRRK2 and tau interact in a disease-relevant manner. Further, the presence of phosphorylation at tau T149 and T153 in a variety of tau pathologies suggests that LRRK2 genetic studies in human tauopathies may be warranted.

Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). The neuropathology of LRRK2-related PD is heterogeneous and can include aberrant tau phosphorylation or neurofibrillary tau pathology. Recently, LRRK2 has been shown to phosphorylate tau in vitro; however, the major epitopes phosphorylated by LRRK2 and the physiological or pathogenic consequences of these modifications in vivo are unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we identified multiple sites on recombinant tau that are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro, including pT149 and pT153, which are phospho-epitopes that to date have been largely unexplored. Importantly, we demonstrate that expression of transgenic LRRK2 in a mouse model of tauopathy increased the aggregation of insoluble tau and its phosphorylation at T149, T153, T205, and S199/S202/T205 epitopes. These findings indicate that tau can be a LRRK2 substrate and that this interaction can enhance salient features of human disease.

PMC3422683_0,"Folate deficiency and hypomethylation have been implicated in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders including dementia and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Levodopa (L-dopa) therapy in PD patients has been shown to cause an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) as well as depleting cellular concentrations of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and increasing the demethylated product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Modulation of the cellular SAM/SAH ratio can influence activity of methyltransferase enzymes including leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT1), that specifically methylates Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major Tau phosphatase. Here we show in human SH-SY5Y cells and dopaminergic neurons, and in wild type mice that L-dopa results in a reduced SAM/SAH ratio that is associated with hypomethylation of PP2A and increased phosphorylation of Tau (p-Tau) at the Alzheimer disease-like PHF-1 phosphoepitope. The effect of L-dopa on PP2A and p-Tau was exacerbated in cells exposed to folate deficiency. In the folate deficient mouse model, L-dopa resulted in a marked depletion of SAM and increase in SAH in various brain regions with parallel down regulation of PP2A methylation and increased Tau phosphorylation. L-dopa also enhanced demethylated PP2A amounts in the liver. These findings reveal a novel mechanism involving methylation-dependent pathways in which L-dopa induces PP2A hypomethylation and increases Tau phosphorylation, which may be potentially detrimental to neuronal cells. We thank Dr. Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY) for the gift of PHF-1 antibodies and Dr. Philip Dickson (University of Newcastle, Australia) for the gift of anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies. This work was supported by NIH grant AG18883 (ES), startup funds from the University of Newcastle, Australia (ES), and a project grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (ES and JMS). Administration of Levodopa (L-dopa) to Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients has proven to be an effective treatment to replenish depleted levels of dopamine (DA) that are characteristic of this neurodegenerative movement disorder (<Cotzias et al., 1969>; <Poewe et al., 2010>). Combining L-dopa with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (<Rinne et al., 1972>), such as carbidopa or benserazide, can reduce the metabolism of L-dopa in peripheral tissues and maximize the amount that enters into the central nervous system. More recent pharmacotherapies include the addition of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors which prolong the half-life of L-dopa and dopamine, resulting in an enhanced effect (<Ericsson et al., 1971>; <Roberts et al., 1993>). This combination therapy can reduce L-dopa related side-effects such as nausea and vomiting. Despite the success of L-dopa combination therapies, that provide almost immediate symptomatic relief, these treatments do not halt the underlying neurodegenerative process. The effectiveness of therapy wanes with time and is associated with dyskinesias, and “on-off” phenomenon (<Stacy, 2009>; <Nutt, 2001>). Additionally, L-dopa is associated with adverse metabolic effects in relation to methylation and homocysteine metabolism. Several investigators have shown that PD patients treated with L-dopa have increased levels of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) (<Irizarry et al., 2005>; <Zoccolella et al., 2009>; <Muller et al., 2009>). Elevated tHcy is a well-established independent risk factor for vascular disease (<Zhou and Austin, 2009>; Mckully, 2007) and has more recently been associated with depression (<Bottiglieri, 2005>) and increased risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) (<Selhub et al., 2010>; <Zhuo et al., 2011>). Increased tHcy may occur as a result of COMT-dependent methylation of L-dopa to 3-O-methyl-dopa (3-OMD). In this reaction, the methyl group originates from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) producing S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is then converted to Hcy (<Fig. 1>). L-dopa administration has been shown to decrease SAM and increase SAH levels in rat tissues (<Wagner et al., 1984>; <Miller et al., 1997>). This may affect other methylation-dependent pathways involving DNA, proteins and other small molecular weight compounds, thereby compromising normal cell function (<Cantoni, 1987>). The amount of folate present in the diet has been shown to influence tissue concentrations of SAM and SAH. We have recently demonstrated that C57BL/6 mice reared on a folate deficient diet have a reduced SAM/SAH ratio in brain tissue which is associated with hypomethylation of the catalytic C subunit of Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major brain Tau phosphatase; This resulted in altered PP2A substrate specificity and subsequent accumulation of phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau) in several brain regions (<Sontag et al., 2008>). Down regulation of PP2A methylation has been reported in autopsy AD brain tissue, and correlates with enhanced neuronal p-Tau levels (<Sontag et al., 2004>). Accumulation of p-Tau species is a significant early event involved in the neuropathology of dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders (<Iqbal et al., 2010>). In view of these findings, we have undertaken a study to determine the interaction between L-dopa and folate deficiency and the effect on methylation cycle metabolites, PP2A methylation and p-Tau in cultured cells and regional mouse brain tissue. Unless indicated, all chemicals and drugs used in this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO and Castle Hill, Australia). Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA and Australia) containing 2.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT and Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd) and 10 µg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). Exponentially growing SH-SY5Y cells were trypsinized and plated in normal cell culture medium. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and serum-starved by overnight incubation in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) prior to treatment.Mature human dopaminergic neurons were obtained after culturing human induced pluripotent cells-derived neural progenitor cells for 14 days, using the ReproNeuro DA kit™ and following exactly the manufacturer’s instructions (ReproCELL, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). A subset of cells was assessed for expression of βIII-tubulin and tyrosine hydroxylase prior to treatment. When indicated, human SH-SY5Y cells and dopaminergic neurons were incubated for 2 h in regular or folate-free RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), as reported earlier for N2a cells (<Sontag et al, 2008>). Cells were treated in the same medium with each drug or vehicle alone for the indicated period of time just prior to harvesting for Western blot analysis. When indicated, cell morphology and viability were assessed as described previously (<Sontag et al, 2008>). A subset of human dopaminergic cells was stained following a standard protocol (<Nunbhakdi-Craig et al, 2007>), Briefly, cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton-X-100, incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer, stained for 1 h with anti-βIII-tubulin (Sigma), followed by incubation for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antibodies (Invitrogen). The samples were mounted with Fluoromount (Fisher Scientific) and examined on an Olympus FV1000 CLSM confocal microscope using a 63x objective. Captured images (z-stacks) were transferred to Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator CS5 for printing (Adobe Systems Incorporated). All experiments with mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor Research Institute. Male C57BJ/6 mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled animal facility on a 12-hour light dark cycle and were allowed access to food and water ad libitum."
PMC3422683_1,"At 4 weeks of age, mice were placed on an amino acid defined diet and divided into three groups (n=12 per group) containing various amount of folate as follows: normal folate (6 7 mg/kg, NF), low folate (0.2 mg/kg, LF) or folate deficient (0 mg/kg, FD). All diets contained succinylsulfathiazole (10 mg/kg) to inhibit gastrointestinal bacterial growth and prevent absorption of folate from this source. After 8 weeks on the diet, mice in each diet group received either two i.p. injections of either saline or a combination of L-dopa (100 mg/kg) and benserazide (10 mg/kg). The second injection was administered 45 minutes after the first. All mice were sacrificed 30 minutes after the second injection by CO2 asphyxiation. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and brain tissue rapidly removed for regional dissection of left and right hemispheres. Liver tissue was also obtained. Tissues were stored at −80°C until time of analysis with the regions from the left hemisphere used for metabolite analysis and the regions from the right hemisphere used for Western blot analysis. Brain and liver tissue were deproteinized with 5 and 10 volumes respectively of perchloric acid (PCA, 0.1M) containing DETAPAC (1 mg/ml) and DTE (0.1 mg/ml). After centrifugation, 10 µL of PCA extract was injected into a HPLC system coupled to UV detection for the analysis of SAM and SAH as previously described (<Bottiglieri, 1990>). L-dopa, DA and their methylated metabolites, 3-O-methyl-dopa (3-OMD) and 3-methoxytyramine (3MT) were measured by HPLC with colorimetric electrochemical detection as previously described (<Ogburn et al., 2006>). Plasma tHcy was determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection (<Ubbink et al., 1991>). Plasma folate was quantified with a Simultrac-SNB RIA kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Total brain homogenates were prepared from each brain region exactly as described previously (<Sontag et al., 2008>). Total cell homogenates were prepared in buffer [Tris 25 mM, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 M sodium fluoride, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 µM okadaic acid, 5 mM PMSF, and 1% NP-40], containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche) (<Sontag et al, 2007>). Detergent-soluble and -insoluble extracts were obtained after further centrifugation for 45 min at 4°C at 30,000g in a Jouan Refrigerated Benchtop Centrifuge (Jouan Inc). Pellets were resuspended in the same buffer and further sonicated to disrupt protein aggregates prior to analysis. Equivalent amounts of proteins (~30 µg) from cell extracts or equivalent aliquots (5 µl) of brain homogenates were analyzed on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels using the NU-PAGE system (Invitrogen) followed by Western blotting and densitometry exactly as described previously (<Sontag et al., 2007>; <2008>). Monoclonal methylation- or demethylation-specific (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and methylation-independent (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) anti-C antibodies were utilized to quantify PP2A methylation levels by Western blotting and densitometry (<Sontag et al., 2004>; <2007>; <2008>). In some experiments, equivalent aliquots of cell or brain tissue homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This alkaline treatment results in complete demethylation of PP2A at Leu-309 and unmasking of the epitope recognized by antibodies directed against the carboxy-terminal 299–309 region of PP2A C subunit. Thus, it can allow for detection of total C expression levels with anti-demethyl C antibodies, and for verification of the specificity of methyl-dependent anti-C antibodies (<Sontag et al., 2004>). Tau phosphorylation was determined exactly as described previously (<Sontag et al., 2007>; <2008>) using monoclonal “PHF-1” recognizing Tau phosphorylated at the Ser396/Ser404 epitope (a gift from Dr. Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY), and rabbit anti-Tau antibodies (rPeptide, Bogart, GA) to detect total Tau. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase was assessed using a rabbit antibody raised against the recombinant human protein (a gift from Dr. Philip Dickson, University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia). Anti-actin or β–tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were utilized to normalize for protein loading. Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison t-test. Differences with p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Incubation of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells for 2 h with L-dopa induced a dose-dependent decrease in both soluble and insoluble methylated PP2A C subunit levels, and concomitant accumulation of demethylated PP2A enzymes (<Fig. 2A, B>). Time-course experiments showed maximal effects on endogenous PP2A methylation after 2 h incubation with 50–100 µM L-dopa. The reduction of methylated C levels induced by 50 µM L-dopa was also similar to that observed with 100 nM of okadaic acid (OA) (<Fig. 2C>), a phosphatase inhibitor known to induce PP2A demethylation (<Favre et al., 1997>). Of note, the signal obtained with the anti-methyl C antibody was lost after alkaline treatment of cell extracts, which induces complete PP2A demethylation (<Sontag et al., 2004>), thereby confirming the antibody’s specificity. SH-SY5Y cells are a widely used cell culture model for PD studies, and it is well established that long term exposure of these cells to L-dopa is associated with oxidative stress and cellular toxicity, ultimately resulting in cell death (<Martin et al., 2005>). Accordingly, we observed considerable morphological changes and cell death after incubation of cells for 16 h with 50 µM L-dopa. In contrast, under our experimental conditions based on short exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to the drug, we did not observed any loss of cell viability (data not shown), as reported previously (<Martin et al., 2005>). Moreover, incubation of SH-SY5Y cells for 2 h with 50 µM L-dopa in the presence of N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid, two antioxidants known to protect against L-dopa-mediated oxidative stress (<Weingarten et al., 2001>), did not prevent L-dopa induced decrease in endogenous PP2A methylation (<Fig. 2D>).Next, we further investigated the effect of L-dopa in folate-deprived SH-SY5Y cells. We have previously shown that PP2A methylation is decreased in N2a cells that have been incubated for 2–4 h in folate deficient (FD) medium (<Sontag et al., 2008>). Likewise, a decrease in methylated and parallel increase in demethylated C subunit levels were observed after incubation of SH-SY5Y cells for 2 h in FD medium (<Fig. 2E>). Interestingly, we found that the combination of L-dopa and folate starvation resulted in enhanced accumulation of demethylated C levels relative to control cells exposed to L-dopa in normal folate (NF) medium. We have previously reported that reduced PP2A methylation in cultured N2a cells and in vivo is associated with increased phosphorylation of endogenous Tau at several epitopes (<Sontag et al., 2007>, <2008>). Accordingly, decreased PP2A methylation also coincided with enhanced phosphorylation of Tau at the PHF-1 (phospho-Ser396/Ser404) epitope in SH-SY5Y cells incubated in FD medium or treated with L-dopa in NF medium). The greatest increase in demethylated C and p-Tau levels was observed after exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to L-dopa in FD medium, indicating that L-dopa augments the effect of folate deficiency. Significantly, we found similar effects in human dopaminergic neurons (<Fig. 2F>). Treatment of neurons with L-Dopa induced a 40–49% decrease in methylated PP2A and concomitant 168–179% increase in endogenous p-Tau (PHF-1) levels (<Fig. 2G>). Relative to controls in NF medium, incubation of neurons for 2 h in FD medium induced a 171–177% and 201–209% increase in endogenous demethylated PP2A and p-Tau amounts, respectively (<Fig. 2H>). As observed in SH-SY5Y cells, these effects were further accentuated in dopaminergic neurons treated with L-Dopa in FD medium."
PMC3422683_2,"Folate starvation in the presence of L-dopa resulted in a 200–210% increase in demethylated PP2A levels, and 235–250% increase in p-Tau levels in the dopaminergic neurons, relative to untreated controls maintained in NF medium  Our findings in cell culture systems prompted us to investigate the effect of L-dopa in a mouse model where we could determine organ specific changes in methylation cycle metabolites and PP2A methylation following L-dopa treatment and folate deficiency. We have previously demonstrated that mice reared on FD diets have increased levels of plasma tHcy which is indicative of reduced functional activity of methionine synthase, a key regulatory enzyme in folate metabolism and the methylation cycle (<Sontag et al., 2008>). Here, we found that administration of L-dopa led to a significant 5-fold increase in plasma tHcy concentrations, when compared to saline treated mice (<Table 1>). This L-dopa induced increase in plasma tHcy was significantly greater in mice that had been reared on either low folate (LF) or FD diets (<Table 1>). Importantly, L-dopa administration had no effect on plasma folate levels, although the expected decrease in plasma folate concentration was similar in mice reared on either LF or FD diets between saline and L-dopa treated mice (<Table 1>). Of particular interest is the effect of L-dopa and folate deficiency on hepatic concentrations of SAM and SAH. L-dopa administration significantly decreased SAM in liver tissue in mice reared on a NF diet (<Fig. 3A>). This effect of L-dopa was markedly exacerbated in mice reared on a LF diet. Mice reared on FD diets had a similar low level of SAM; however, L-dopa did not have any further effect. The concentration of SAH in liver tissue was significantly higher in mice reared on a FD diet. In these mice, L-dopa led to an even greater increase in SAH (<Fig. 3B>). As a result, the hepatic SAM/SAH ratio was reduced when L-dopa was administered to mice on either a NF or FD diet (<Fig. 3C>). These changes in SAM and SAH were associated with a significant increase in the percentage of demethylated PP2A (<Fig. 3D, E>). Relative to mice on control diets, demethylated C levels were increased in mice on LF and FD diets. Remarkably, L-dopa administered to mice on a NF diet increased the amounts of demethylated C, which were significantly greater when given to mice on a FD diet (<Fig. 3D, E>).Exogenously administered L-dopa is rapidly absorbed and decarboxylated to DA. Co-administration of benserazide, an inhibitor of AADC, prevents metabolism to DA in peripheral tissues. However, L-dopa is also methylated to 3-OMD, a reaction that requires SAM and produces SAH. We have shown that L-dopa concentrations increase in mouse brain tissue following its administration with a concomitant increase in DA that varies depending on the distribution of dopaminergic innervation in various regions (<Table 2>). As expected, the highest levels of DA were found in the striatum, a dopaminergic neuron-rich region, followed by midbrain, frontal cortex and cerebellum. In addition, methylation of L-dopa and DA led to significant increases in 3-OMD and 3-MT concentrations, respectively, in all brain regions, although the methylated monoamines were significantly less in mice reared on a FD diet compared to mice on a NF diet (<Table 2>). SAM is the methyl donor for these reactions involving COMT and it produces SAH (<Fig. 1>). Methylation of L-dopa and DA by COMT accounts for the marked decrease in SAM levels and increase in SAH levels in all brain regions following the exogenous administration of L-dopa (<Fig. 4A, B>). Of particular significance is that the L-dopa induced decrease in SAM and increase in SAH were exacerbated in most brain regions by LF and FD diets. We have previously shown decreased SAM and increased SAH levels in mice reared on LF and FD diets, compared to mice on a NF diet, and consequently the SAM/SAH ratio is markedly reduced (<Sontag et al., 2008>). Here, we found that administration of L-dopa in mice on either LF or FD diets resulted in a greater reduction in the SAM/SAH ratio in several brain regions compared to saline treated mice on corresponding diets (<Fig 4C>). This effect was less pronounced in the striatum with respect to other regions since the SAM/SAH ratio is relatively low, due to lower levels of SAM and higher levels of SAH, in mice on a NF diet. We have shown that PP2A methylation levels are reduced in brain tissue from mice reared on LF and FD diets (<Sontag et al, 2008>). Here we demonstrate that PP2A methylated C subunit levels are significantly decreased following administration of L-dopa with respect to saline treated mice fed a NF diet. Moreover, decreased PP2A methylation is significantly greater when L-dopa was given to mice fed either a LF diet (cortex and cerebellum only), or a FD diet (all brain regions) compared to L-dopa treated mice fed a NF diet (<Fig. 5A, B>). Reductions in PP2A methylation were associated with a concomitant increase in each brain region of p-Tau at the PHF-1 epitope (<Fig. 6A,B>). We observed that L-dopa increased Tau phoshorylation in mice fed a NF diet, and this effect was augmented in mice on a LF or FD diet. Substantial evidence implicates folate deficiency and hypomethylation in the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including AD (Mattson et al., 2003). In support of this are reports that have identified a central role for folate and methylation dependent pathways in processing both Tau and amyloid precursor proteins that are well established neuropathological hallmarks of AD (<Sontag et al., 2007>, <2008>; <Fuso and Scarpa 2011>). SAM is the sole methyl-group donor and a critical metabolite that regulates the activity of numerous methyltransferase reactions (Chiang et al 2001), including PP2A methylation (<Janssens et al 2008>). Intracellular levels of SAM are maintained by a highly regulated methylation cycle that is dependent on folate and vitamin B12 which act as cofactors for methionine synthase, a key enzyme for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine (<Fig. 1>). In addition, drugs that interfere with folate metabolism or the methylation cycle can affect cellular SAM levels. One such compound is L-dopa which is O-methylated by SAM in a COMT dependent reaction. We here report for the first time the combined effect of folate deficiency and L-dopa on methylation cycle metabolites, PP2A methylation and p-Tau levels in cultured cells and in a mouse model. We first show in SH-SY5Y cells that L-dopa dose-dependently induces a decrease in both soluble and insoluble methylated PP2A levels. Carboxyl methylation of PP2A catalytic subunit on Leu-309 by SAM-dependent LCMT1 enhances the biogenesis and stability of PP2A enzymes containing the Bα regulatory subunit (PP2A/Bα, the primary PP2A isoforms that dephosphorylate Tau (<Sontag et al. 1996>, <1999>, <2008>; <Xu et al., 2008>). Methylated PP2A/Bα enzymes fractionate in both soluble and insoluble (containing microtubule-associated forms) fractions from neuronal cells (<Sontag et al., 1995>, <2007>). This has implications for PP2A-dependent regulation of tau and microtubules, as methylated PP2A/Bα enzymes associate with microtubules (<Sontag et al., 1995>), regulate microtubule dynamics (<Nunbhakdi-Craig et al,. 2007>) and the ability of tau to bind to and stabilize microtubules (<Sontag et al., 1996>). Importantly, PP2A/Bα can only bind to and dephosphorylate tau when both proteins are not bound to microtubules (<Sontag et al., 1999>). PP2A methylation was markedly decreased by L-dopa in both SH-SY5Y cells and human dopaminergic neurons. The extent of PP2A demethylation correlated with an increase in p-Tau (PHF-1) levels. We observed a synergistic effect of L-dopa and folate deficiency, implying that under these conditions the methylation cycle is severely compromised."
PMC3422683_3,"L-dopa and folate deficiency can perturb the methylation cycle in several ways: (1) impaired conversion of Hcy to methionine leading to reduced synthesis of SAM; (2) accumulation of Hcy may be metabolized to SAH, a potent competitive inhibitor of methyltransferase enzymes (<Cantoni GL, 1987>; <Chiang et al 1998>); (3) methylation of L-dopa to 3-OMD will deplete intracellular pools of SAM as well as increasing SAH and, (4) L-dopa competes with methionine for transport across cell membranes through the large neutral amino acid transporter, and limit SAM synthesis (<Baldessarini and Karobath, 1972>) In support of our in vitro findings, exogenous administration of L-dopa increased plasma tHcy in mice fed a NF diet, an effect that was exacerbated in mice fed either a LF or FD diet. While plasma tHcy is a sensitive marker of folate deficiency (<Stabler 2000>; <Selhub et al., 2010>), it may also reflect the activity of COMT-dependent methylation of L-dopa. This is confirmed by the L-dopa induced decrease in SAM, increase in SAH and corresponding decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio in liver tissue that we and other investigators have observed (<Wagner et al., 1984>, <Miller et al., 1997>). LCMT1 activity is affected by reduced availability of SAM and competitive inhibition from increased SAH, which is reflected by increased levels of demethylated PP2A in liver tissue. These findings have significant implications for patients with PD and those with other neurodegenerative disorders who receive L-dopa therapy, as well as children diagnosed with L-dopa responsive dystonia due to inherited disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis and tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (<Swoboda K, 2006>). In the later group, L-dopa treatment may commence early in life and continue indefinitely. Increased levels of plasma tHcy following L-dopa treatment in PD have been reported by several investigators (<Irizarry et al., 2005>; <Muller et al., 2009>; Yasu et al., 2000; <Yuan et al., 2009>). Furthermore, L-dopa treatment in PD is associated with decreased SAM (<Cheng et al., 1997>; De Bonnis et al., 2010) and increased SAH concentrations in erythrocytes (De Bonnis et al., 2010). CSF tHcy became significantly higher following L-dopa treatment in 18 patients with PD compared to pre-treatment levels (<Isobe et al., 2010>). Likewise, L-dopa therapy in children was associated with a significant decrease in the concentration of SAM in CSF that was inversely correlated with elevated concentrations of CSF 3-OMD (<Surtees and Hyland, 1990>). These observations clearly establish that L-dopa treatment has significant effects on methylation cycle metabolites.Our findings confirm that L-dopa has a marked effect on methylation cycle metabolites in brain tissue. Decarboxylation of L-dopa to DA occurs predominately in the striatum; however O-methylation of L-dopa to 3-OMD, as well as methylation of DA to 3-MT, occurs in all brain regions resulting in a considerable decrease in the concentration of SAM. In some brain regions (cortex, midbrain and cerebellum), L-dopa induced decrease in SAM was aggravated by folate deficiency. Significantly, in all regions of the brain studied, accumulation of the demethylated metabolite SAH was highest in mice treated with L-dopa and exposed to FD diets. Folate deficiency restricts metabolism of Hcy causing intracellular SAH accumulation, thereby compounding the effect of L-dopa. SAH is a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, including COMT, and this is evident from the significantly lower levels of 3-OMD and 3-MT in all brain regions following L-dopa in mice reared on a FD diet. Furthermore, we demonstrated that L-dopa significantly decreased PP2A methylation in mice fed a NF diet. We attribute this to a decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio and down regulation of LCMT1, an effect that was greatest in mice fed a LF or FD diet. In support of this, we have previously shown that folate deficiency in mice results in a reduced SAM/SAH ratio and down regulation of LCMT1 in brain tissue (<Sontag et al., 2008>). L-dopa induced loss of methylated PP2A was associated with increased p-Tau (PHF-1) levels in all brain regions studied. Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, promotes PP2A demethylation and Tau hyperphosphorylation in rat primary cortical neurons (<Yoon et al., 2007>), an effect probably mediated through inhibition of folate metabolism and altered SAM and Hcy metabolism. Enhanced Tau phosphorylation is potentially neurotoxic to cells by promoting microtubule destabilization and favoring Tau mislocalization and aggregation (<Iqbal et al., 2010>). Our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which L-dopa increases phosphorylation of Tau protein, which has major implications for patients with PD or other neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, COMT inhibitors may be protective against this effect. In one study, tolcapone, a centrally acting COMT inhibitor, was shown to lower plasma tHcy and SAH levels in PD patients treated with L-dopa and a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (<Muller and Kuhn, 2006>). COMT inhibition in L-dopa treated PD patients was proposed to potentially reduce Hcy mediated neuronal degeneration, risk of onset of dementia, vascular disease and polyneuropathy that are commonly prevalent in PD. An earlier study found that rats given a centrally acting COMT inhibitor prior to L-dopa attenuated or prevented entirely the L-dopa induced decreased in SAM and increase in SAH in both peripheral and regional brain tissue (<Miller et al., 1997>). Moreover, folate intake has been recently reported to normalize plasma tHcy levels in hyper-homocysteinemic PD patients (Belcastro et al., 2009). Altogether, these data reinforce the importance of monitoring methylation pathways during L-dopa treatment.In conclusion, our studies have demonstrated a novel mechanism involving methylation-dependent pathways that can lead to deregulation of PP2A and accumulation of P-Tau with potential detrimental effects in neuronal cells. This effect is exacerbated when folate metabolism is compromised, which cannot only occur through dietary insufficiency as shown in this study, but also from the use of antifolate drugs or existence of common polymorphisms related to the folate-methylation cycle. This dietary-genetic-drug interaction is particularly relevant in PD patients since hyperphosphorylation of Tau is an early event in dementia (<Hanger et al., 2009>) and there is increasing evidence for a contribution of Tau in PD pathogenesis (<Lei et al., 2010>). For instance, p-Tau accumulates in PD Lewy bodies, which are cytoplasmic inclusions enriched in α-synuclein. Tau also enhances α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in cellular models of synucleinopathy (<Badiola et al., 2011>). Indeed, there is ample experimental proof for synergistic effects of α-synuclein and Tau protein interactions in neurodegenerative disorders (<Jellinger, 2011>). Notably, PP2A has been shown to dephosphorylate hyperphosphorylated aggregates of α-synuclein in a mouse model (<Lee et al., 2011>). Thus, deregulation of PP2A by long-term use of L-dopa may promote an increase in both hyperphosphorylated Tau and α-synuclein. It remains to be seen if therapies that enhance PP2A methylation are effective in reducing toxicity associated with these neurodegenerative proteinopathies. rhetorical Figure 1 Exogenously administered L-dopa is either decarboxylated to form DA or may be methylated in a COMT dependent reaction that utilizes SAM as the methyl donor to form 3-OMD. The by-product of COMT activity is SAH which is converted to Hcy by the reversible reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase. Folate deficiency promotes accumulation of Hcy which may be converted back to SAH, a potent inhibitor of methyltransferases. Methylation of PP2A C subunit by the methyltransferase LCMT1 promotes assembly and stabilization of PP2A/Bα heterotrimers that dephosphorylate Tau on Ser/Thr residues. Conversely, GSK-3β and other kinases (not shown here) can phosphorylate Tau on Ser/Thr residues.."

Folate deficiency and hypomethylation have been implicated in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders including dementia and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Levodopa (L-dopa) therapy in PD patients has been shown to cause an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) as well as depleting cellular concentrations of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and increasing the demethylated product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Modulation of the cellular SAM/SAH ratio can influence activity of methyltransferase enzymes including leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT1), that specifically methylates Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major Tau phosphatase. Here we show in human SH-SY5Y cells and dopaminergic neurons, and in wild type mice that L-dopa results in a reduced SAM/SAH ratio that is associated with hypomethylation of PP2A and increased phosphorylation of Tau (p-Tau) at the Alzheimer disease-like PHF-1 phosphoepitope. The effect of L-dopa on PP2A and p-Tau was exacerbated in cells exposed to folate deficiency. In the folate deficient mouse model, L-dopa resulted in a marked depletion of SAM and increase in SAH in various brain regions with parallel down regulation of PP2A methylation and increased Tau phosphorylation. L-dopa also enhanced demethylated PP2A amounts in the liver. These findings reveal a novel mechanism involving methylation-dependent pathways in which L-dopa induces PP2A hypomethylation and increases Tau phosphorylation, which may be potentially detrimental to neuronal cells. ."
PMC3431335_0,"Abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of a microtubule-associated protein tau are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, what pathological conditions trigger tau abnormality in AD is not fully understood. A reduction in the number of mitochondria in the axon has been implicated in AD. In this study, we investigated whether and how loss of axonal mitochondria promotes tau phosphorylation and toxicity in vivo. Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human tau, we found that RNAi–mediated knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, enhanced human tau-induced neurodegeneration. Tau phosphorylation at an AD–related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1. These results suggest that an increase in tau phosphorylation at Ser262 through PAR-1 contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration under a pathological condition in which axonal mitochondria is depleted. Intriguingly, we found that knockdown of milton or Miro alone caused late-onset neurodegeneration in the fly brain, and this neurodegeneration could be suppressed by knockdown of Drosophila tau or PAR-1. Our results suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria may play an important role in tau phosphorylation and toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD. Abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of a microtubule-associated protein tau are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau is phosphorylated at multiple sites, and phosphorylation of tau regulates its microtubule binding and physiological functions such as regulation of microtubule stability. Abnormal phosphorylation of tau occurs in the AD brains and is thought to cause tau toxicity; however, what pathological conditions trigger abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of tau in AD is not fully understood. Since a reduction in the number of mitochondria in the axon has been observed in the AD brains, we investigated whether and how loss of axonal mitochondria promotes tau phosphorylation and toxicity. Using transgenic flies expressing human tau, we found that knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, enhanced human tau-induced neurodegeneration. This study demonstrates that loss of axonal mitochondria caused by milton knockdown increases tau phosphorylation at an AD–related site through partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), promotes detachment of tau from microtubules, and enhances tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria may play an important role in tau phosphorylation and toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD. We thank Drs.

Defects in mitochondrial distribution have been observed in the brains of patients suffering from several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) <[2]>. Recent studies have shown that the localization of mitochondria to the axon is reduced in neurons in the AD brain, as well as in cellular and animal models of AD <[3]>–<[14]>. The reduction in mitochondria in the axon may be due to alterations in mitochondrial fission/fusion <[3]>, <[5]>, <[6]> and/or due to defects in the axonal transport of mitochondria <[4]>, <[6]>, <[8]>, <[10]>–<[12]>. However, how it contributes to the pathogenesis of AD remains elusive.Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed in neurons and localizes predominantly in the axons, where it regulates microtubule dynamics. Tau is phosphorylated at a number of sites, and a fine-tuned balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tau is critical for its physiological functions, such as microtubule stabilization, in the axons <[15]>.Hyperphosphorylated tau is found in neurofibrillary tangles, the intracellular protein inclusions that are associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases including AD <[15]>. In AD brains, tau phosphorylation is abnormally increased at several specific sites, and these changes are associated with tau toxicity <[15]>, <[16]>. However, the effects of loss of axonal mitochondria on abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of tau has not been fully elucidated.Mitochondrial transport is regulated by a series of molecular adaptors that mediate the attachment of mitochondria to molecular motors <[17]>. In Drosophila, mitochondrial transport is facilitated by milton and Miro, which regulate mitochondrial attachment to microtubules via kinesin heavy chain <[18]>, <[19]>. In mammals, two isoforms of milton (OIP106 and GRIF1) and Miro (Miro1 and Miro2) have been identified and are proposed to act in a similar manner <[20]>. In Drosophila, in the absence of milton or Miro, synaptic terminals and axons lack mitochondria, although mitochondria are numerous in the neuronal cell body <[18]>, <[21]>.In this study, using Drosophila as a model system, we investigated the effects of knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, on tau phosphorylation and toxicity. We demonstrate that loss of axonal mitochondria caused by milton knockdown increases tau phosphorylation at Ser262 through PAR-1, promotes detachment of tau from microtubules, and enhances tau-mediated neurodegeneration. To test whether loss of axonal mitochondria enhances human tau toxicity in vivo, we used transgenic Drosophila expressing human tau <[22]>. Wild-type human 0N4R tau, which has four tubulin-binding domains (R) and no N-terminal insert (N), was expressed in fly eyes using the GAL4/UAS system <[23]> with the pan-retinal gmr-GAL4 driver. Expression of human tau causes age-dependent and progressive neurodegeneration in the lamina, the first synaptic neuropil of the optic lobe containing photoreceptor axons: degeneration in the lamina is undetectable or very mild in flies at 3-day-old, while it is prominent at 10-day-old (<Figure S1A and S1B; S1D>, quantification).It has been reported that overexpression of tau alone can reduce anterograde transport of a variety of kinesin cargos, including mitochondria <[4]>, <[9]>, <[11]>, <[12]>, <[24]>. We examined whether tau expression alone causes the loss of mitochondria at the synaptic terminals of young tau flies by electron microscopy. Mitochondria were observed in the synaptic terminals of photoreceptor neurons expressing tau at 3-day-old (<Figure S2>), suggesting that, under our experimental conditions, severe defects in microtubule-dependent transport are not occurred in the young flies expressing human tau.Milton is a component of an adaptor complex that links mitochondria to kinesin heavy chain and is essential for axonal transport of mitochondria (<Figure 1A>) <[19]>. Previously, we have shown that milton RNAi expression effectively reduces milton protein levels, reduces the axonal distribution of mitochondria and increases the mitochondrial localization to the cell body in the fly brain <[7]>."

Previously, we have shown that milton RNAi expression effectively reduces milton protein levels, reduces the axonal distribution of mitochondria and increases the mitochondrial localization to the cell body in the fly brain <[7]>. We confirmed that expression of milton RNAi in fly eyes caused loss of mitochondria in the synaptic terminals of the photoreceptor neurons by electron microscopy analysis. Mitochondria were seldom observed in the synaptic terminals of photoreceptor neurons expressing milton RNAi, while mitochondria were abundant in the synaptic terminals of control flies (compare <Figure 1B and 1C>). In addition, the presynaptic terminals contained vesicles with a wider range of sizes in the milton knockdown flies than in controls (<Figure S3>), as previously observed in milton mutant flies <[25]>.To investigate tau toxicity under the condition in which mitochondria are chronically depleted from the axon, we co-expressed milton RNAi with human tau. We confirmed that milton knockdown caused loss of axonal mitochondria in the neurons expressing tau by electron microscopy (<Figure S4>). Co-expression of tau with milton RNAi (milton RNAiGD) dramatically enhanced neurodegeneration in the lamina at 3-day-old compared to fly eyes expressing tau alone (<Figure 1E and 1F; 1M>, quantification). In 3-day-old flies, knockdown of milton alone did not cause neurodegeneration (<Figure 1H>) <[21]>. To limit the possibility of off-target effects of RNAi, another independent transgenic fly line carrying a milton RNAi that targets a different region of milton (milton RNAiTRiP) was used. Expression of this RNAi in neurons reduced milton mRNA levels in the fly brain (<Figure S5A>) as well as the axonal distribution of mitochondria (<Figure S5B>). The enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration was also observed with milton RNAiTRiP (<Figure 1G; 1M>, quantification).We also tested the effect of knockdown of Miro, which is another critical component of the adaptor complex that controls mitochondrial trafficking in the axons <[18]>, <[19]> (<Figure 1A>), on tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Expression of Miro RNAi (Miro RNAiKK) <[26]> reduced the axonal distribution of mitochondria in the fly brain (<Figure S6>) and significantly enhanced tau-induced neurodegeneration (<Figure 1I; 1M>, quantification). To limit the possibility of off-target effects of RNAi, we generated another independent transgenic fly line carrying Miro RNAi (Miro RNAiiai) that targets a different region of Miro. Expression of Miro RNAiiai reduced Miro mRNA levels (<Figure S7>) and significantly enhanced tau-induced neurodegeneration (<Figure 1J; 1M>, quantification). Similar to a previous report <[21]>, knockdown of Miro alone did not cause neurodegeneration in 3-day-old flies (<Figure 1K>).The enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration by milton RNAi or Miro RNAi is not due to non-specific effects of RNAi overexpression, since the expression of an RNAi against firefly luciferase (<Figure 1L>), as well as the expression of many other RNAis (<Figure S8>), did not enhance tau-induced neurodegeneration.Expression of human tau in Drosophila eyes reduces the external eye size (<Figure S9B>), which is due to apoptosis during the larval stage <[27]>. Genetic screens assessing changes in this phenotype have identified a number of modifiers of tau toxicity <[28]>–<[30]>. However, neither milton nor Miro was identified in the previous screens <[28]>–<[30]>. We found that knockdown of either milton or Miro did not enhance the tau-induced reduction in external eye size (<Figure S9C and S9D>). These results indicate that the modifier screen using tau-induced lamina degeneration as a read-out phenotype yields new genes involved in tau-induced neurodegeneration.Taken together, these results demonstrate that the knockdown of milton or Miro enhances human tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration in the lamina in flies expressing tau alone (<Figure 2A>) or expressing tau and milton RNAi (<Figure 2B, 2E, 2F and 2G>) at 3-day-old was examined at the ultrastructural level. Axon pathology, including the formation of vacuoles in the axons (asterisks in <Figure 2A, 2B and 2E>) and swollen axons (arrows in <Figure 2E>), were observed. In the presynaptic terminals, vacuoles (<Figure 2F>, asterisks) and the accumulation of autophagic bodies and multivesicular bodies (<Figure 2F and 2G>, arrows) were observed. These pathological changes were more severe and prominent in the lamina of flies expressing tau and milton RNAi than in flies expressing tau alone. Neurofibrillary tangles were not detected in flies expressing human tau and milton RNAi, indicating that milton knockdown enhances the tau-induced axonopathy without the formation of large tau aggregates. Axonal or presynaptic degeneration was not observed in the control flies (<Figure 2C and 2H>) or in flies with milton knockdown alone at 3-day-old (<Figure 2D and 2I>)."

A group of Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in tau is abnormally phosphorylated in the AD brain <[31]>. Using well-characterized phospho-tau-specific antibodies, we examined whether milton knockdown affects tau phosphorylation at AD-related sites by Western blotting. The level of tau phosphorylated at Ser262 was significantly increased by milton knockdown (<Figure 3A>). Knockdown of Miro also increased the levels of tau phosphorylated at Ser262 (<Figure 3B>). In contrast, tau phosphorylation at the AT8 epitope (phospho-Ser202) or the AT180 epitope (phospho-Thr231) was not significantly altered by milton knockdown (<Figure 3A>).

The levels of total tau were not significantly changed (<Figure 3A>), indicating that milton knockdown does not cause tau accumulation.Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to reduce tau binding to microtubules <[32]>, <[33]>. We tested whether milton knockdown alters the binding of tau to microtubules by using microtubule binding assay. Microtubules and microtubule-bound proteins were recovered as the pellet by centrifugation from brains of flies expressing human tau alone or co-expressing human tau and milton RNAi. The pellet (microtubule-bound fraction) and supernatant (microtubule-free fraction) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and tau levels in these fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Milton knockdown caused a significant reduction in the amount of tau in the pellet and an increase in tau in the supernatant (<Figure 3C>). This result indicates that milton knockdown reduces tau binding to microtubules and increases the levels of microtubule-unbound, free tau in the fly brain.

RNAi-mediated knockdown of PAR-1 significantly suppressed neurodegeneration in the lamina of flies expressing human tau and milton RNAi (<Figure 5A and 5B; 5D>, quantification). This effect is not due to titration of the effectiveness of RNAi, since the expression of an RNAi against firefly luciferase did not significantly suppress tau-induced neurodegeneration in the milton knockdown background (<Figure 5A and 5C; 5D>, quantification).Next, to determine whether the Ser262 site is required for the knockdown of milton to enhance tau-induced axon degeneration, transgenic flies carrying human tau with the S262A mutation (S262A tau) expressed at the levels similar to the expression of wild-type tau (<[36]> and <Figure 5E>) were used. It has been reported that introduction of the S262A mutation dramatically rescues tau-induced reduction in external eye size <[35]>, <[36]>, which is due to apoptosis during the larval stage <[27]>. Interestingly, we found that expression of S262A tau caused age-dependent neurodegeneration in the lamina similar to that caused by wild type tau: in the flies expressing S262A tau, degeneration in the lamina was undetectable or very mild in flies at 3-day-old, while it was prominent at 10-day-old (<Figure S10>). Using S262A tau flies, we found that the introduction of the S262A mutation suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced axon degeneration caused by milton knockdown (<Figure 5F and 5G; 5H>, quantification). Taken together, these results suggest that tau phosphorylation at Ser262 and PAR-1 play a critical role in the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of milton or Miro enhances tau-induced neurodegeneration and increases tau phosphorylation at Ser262. PAR-1 mediates the increase in tau phosphorylation at Ser262, and tau phosphorylation site Ser262 and PAR-1 are critical for the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. To further investigate the relationship between loss of axonal mitochondria and PAR-1, the effect of knockdown of milton or Miro on PAR-1 activity was examined.To detect active PAR-1, a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes phosphorylated Thr408 of PAR-1, which is important for PAR-1 activity <[37]>, was used. The titer of the antibody is not sufficient to detect endogenous PAR-1 in fly eyes <[37]>, but the antibody recognizes the active form of PAR-1 when PAR-1 is overexpressed <[37]>. Co-expression of milton RNAi increases the levels of Thr408-phosphorylated PAR-1 in the fly eye (<Figure 6A>). In addition to the levels of Thr408-phosphorylated PAR-1, we observed an increase in total PAR-1 levels with knockdown of milton (<Figure 6A>). Similar results were obtained with another milton RNAi line (milton RNAiTRiP) (<Figure 6B>). Furthermore, expression of Miro RNAi also caused an increase in the levels of Thr408-phosphorylated PAR-1 as well as total PAR-1 in the fly eyes (<Figure 6C>). These effects are not due to non-specific effect of RNAi expression, since the expression of an RNAi against firefly luciferase did not increase either the levels of Thr408-phosphorylated PAR-1 or total PAR-1 (<Figure 6D>). rhetorical Figure 6 (A) Western blots of eyes from flies expressing myc-tagged PAR-1 alone or flies co-expressing PAR-1 and milton RNAiGD.

Furthermore, expression of Miro RNAi also caused an increase in the levels of Thr408-phosphorylated PAR-1 as well as total PAR-1 in the fly eyes (<Figure 6C>). These effects are not due to non-specific effect of RNAi expression, since the expression of an RNAi against firefly luciferase did not increase either the levels of Thr408-phosphorylated PAR-1 or total PAR-1 (<Figure 6D>).A previous report showed that total PAR-1 level increased when it was phosphorylated at Thr408 in Drosophila

PMC3431335_4,"To examine whether the increase in PAR-1 levels with milton knockdown is Thr408-dependent, transgenic flies carrying PAR-1 with unphosphorylatable alanine mutation at Thr408 (PAR-1 T408A) <[37]> were used  Milton RNAi coexpression did not increase PAR-1 T408A protein levels (<Figure 6E>), indicating that Thr408 is important for the increase in PAR-1 levels caused by milton knockdown.Milton knockdown did not cause non-specific activation of kinases, since it did not increase the level of phosphorylated, active p44mapk in fly eyes (<Figure S11>). Moreover, milton knockdown did not cause non-specific accumulation of overexpressed proteins, or an increase in the expression of genes under the control of GAL4/UAS system, since it did not increase the levels of total p44mapk, GFP, or amyloid precursor protein expressed via the GAL4/UAS system (<Figure S11>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that milton knockdown specifically increases the level of active PAR-1.We also observed that the phenotype induced by PAR-1 overexpression was enhanced by milton knockdown. Overexpression of PAR-1 in fly eyes has been reported to cause eye degeneration <[35]>, and we found that overexpression of PAR-1 caused age-dependent, mild neurodegeneration in the lamina: neurodegeneration in the lamina is undetectable in flies overexpressing PAR-1 at 3-day-old, while it is detectable at 10-day-old (<Figure S12A–S12C, S12D>, quantification). Co-expression of PAR-1 and milton RNAi caused prominent neurodegeneration in the lamina at 3-day-old, when neither PAR-1 overexpression alone or knockdown of milton alone caused neurodegeneration (<Figure S12, S12E–S12G; S12H>, quantification). These phenotypic analyses further suggest that milton knockdown increases PAR-1 activity in the eye. Although knockdown of milton or Miro without human tau overexpression did not cause neurodegeneration in the young flies (<Figure 1H and 1K>), we found that knockdown of milton or Miro alone caused late-onset neurodegeneration in the fly brain. Expression of milton RNAi in the fly eyes and brains with a combination of two GAL4 drivers, the pan-retinal gmr-GAL4 driver and pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver, caused age-dependent neurodegeneration (<Figure 7A>, 21 days-after-eclosion (day-old)). Interestingly, although milton RNAi was expressed in the all neurons in the eye and brain, degeneration was the most prominent in the optic lobe (<Figure 7A>). No degeneration was observed in the brain in flies expressing an RNAi against firefly luciferase at the same age (<Figure 7B>, control). rhetorical Figure 7 (A–B) The brain of flies expressing milton RNAi with a combination of two drivers, the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver and pan-retinal gmr-GAL4 driver (A) and control (luciferase RNAi) (B).

Although knockdown of milton or Miro without human tau overexpression did not cause neurodegeneration in the young flies (<Figure 1H and 1K>), we found that knockdown of milton or Miro alone caused late-onset neurodegeneration in the fly brain. Expression of milton RNAi in the fly eyes and brains with a combination of two GAL4 drivers, the pan-retinal gmr-GAL4 driver and pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver, caused age-dependent neurodegeneration (<Figure 7A>, 21 days-after-eclosion (day-old)). Interestingly, although milton RNAi was expressed in the all neurons in the eye and brain, degeneration was the most prominent in the optic lobe (<Figure 7A>). No degeneration was observed in the brain in flies expressing an RNAi against firefly luciferase at the same age (<Figure 7B>, control).We quantified age-dependent progression of neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown in the lamina, where neurodegeneration was the most prominent. Degeneration in the lamina is undetectable at 3-day-old, which is in line with the previous observation in milton mutant flies <[25]>. In contrast, degeneration was observed at 20-day-old and was more prominent at 30-day-old, indicating that milton knockdown causes late-onset and progressive neurodegeneration (<Figure 7>, compare 7C (3-day-old), 7D (20-day-old) and 7E (30-day-old); G, quantification of vacuole areas). No degeneration was observed in the lamina in control flies at 30-day-old (<Figure 7F>).To limit the possibility of off-target effects of RNAi, another independent transgenic fly line carrying a milton RNAi that targets a different region of milton (milton RNAiTRiP) was used. Expression of milton RNAiTRiP also caused age-dependent neurodegeneration in the lamina (<Figure 7H–7J; 7K>, quantification of vacuole areas). Knockdown of Miro in the fly brains also caused neurodegeneration in the lamina in aged flies (<Figure 7L–7M; 7N>, quantification of vacuole areas). Collectively, these results suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria is sufficient to cause late-onset neurodegeneration.While our paper is under review, it was reported that knockdown of milton led to progressive axon degeneration in the Drosophila wing neurons <[38]>. The Drosophila tau exhibits a high degree of similarity with the human tau protein and shares a numbers of important features such as the microtubule-binding domains <[39]> and several phosphorylation sites critical for its functions and toxicity <[40]>. Overexpression of Drosophila tau has been reported to be capable of inducing neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration <[41]>–<[43]>. We examined whether Drosophila tau is involved in neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. We found that expression of RNAi targeting Drosophila tau reduced tau mRNA levels in the fly brain (<Figure S13>) and significantly suppressed neurodegeneration in the lamina caused by milton knockdown (<Figure 8A and 8B; 8D>, quantification). This effect is not due to titration of the effectiveness of RNAi, since the expression of an RNAi against firefly luciferase did not suppress neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown (Compare <Figure 8A and 8C; 8D>, quantification). We further examined whether PAR-1 is involved in neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PAR-1 significantly suppressed neurodegeneration in the lamina of flies expressing milton RNAi (<Figure 8E and 8F; 8G>, quantification). These results suggest that Drosophila endogenous tau and PAR-1 contribute to milton knockdown-induced neurodegeneration and further support the conclusions of this study. rhetorical Figure 8 (A–D) The lamina of flies expressing milton RNAi alone (A), co-expressing milton RNAi and Drosophila tau RNAi (B), and co-expressing milton RNAi and luciferase RNAi (C).

These results suggest that Drosophila endogenous tau and PAR-1 contribute to milton knockdown-induced neurodegeneration and further support the conclusions of this study. Abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of tau are thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulation of amyloid-β peptides is thought to be causative for AD and has been suggested to cause tau abnormality <[44]>–<[53]>, however, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. A reduction in the number of mitochondria in the axon is observed in the brains of AD patients <[3]>, and we and others previously reported that amyloid-β peptides reduce the number of mitochondria in the axons <[3]>–<[11]>. In this study, we examined whether and how loss of axonal mitochondria increases phosphorylation of human tau at AD-related sites and enhances tau toxicity. Our data demonstrate that loss of axonal mitochondria caused by knockdown of milton or Miro increases tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 through PAR-1, promotes detachment of tau from microtubules, and enhances tau-mediated neurodegeneration. These results suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria may play an important role in tau phosphorylation and toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD.It has been reported that, in non-neuronal cultured cells or primary-cultured hippocampal neurons with virus-mediated overexpression of human tau, an excess of microtubule-bound tau blocks microtubule-dependent transport of vesicles and organelle including mitochondria and causes synaptic degeneration <[54]>, <[55]>. These works have demonstrated that tau phosphorylation at Ser262 by a PAR-1 homolog MARK2 removes tau from the microtubule tracks, which restores microtubule-dependent transport of vesicles and organelle, and rescues accompanied synaptic degeneration <[54]>. Thus, tau phosphorylation at Ser262 plays a protective role against tau-induced toxicity in their models in which an excess of microtubule-bound tau blocks traffic of vesicles and organelle.In contrast, this study examined whether and how specific loss of axonal mitochondria promotes tau phosphorylation and toxicity. To address this question in vivo, we used a Drosophila model of human tau toxicity <[22]>. In this model, we did not observe severe defects in microtubule-dependent transport under our experimental condition, since mitochondria are present at the synaptic terminals of neurons expressing human tau in the young flies (<Figure S2>). To chronically deplete mitochondria from the axon, we used knockdown of milton or Miro. The most critical difference between the models used in Thies and Mandelkow <[54]> and our model is that, in the models of Thies and Mandelkow, mitochondrial transport defects were depending on tau binding to microtubules, while in our model, mitochondria were chronically depleted from the axon by milton knockdown.Using this model system, we found that milton knockdown significantly enhanced tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Milton knockdown increased the levels of active PAR-1 and tau phosphorylation at Ser262, and promoted detachment of tau from microtubules. If the enhancement of tau toxicity caused by milton knockdown in our model is due to an additive reduction in the number of axonal mitochondria, blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262, which increases tau binding to microtubules and blocks microtubule-dependent transport, would enhance neurodegeneration. However, our results have shown that blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 by PAR-1 knockdown rescues the enhancement of tau-mediated neurodegeneration in the milton knockdown background. These results suggest that the enhancement of tau toxicity in the milton knockdown background is not likely to be due to an additive reduction of axonal transport of mitochondria caused by an excess of microtubule-bound tau. Rather, this study suggests that, when axonal mitochondria are chronically depleted, increased free, microtubule-unbound, Ser262-phosphorylated tau promotes neurodegeneration.A fine-tuned balance of microtubule-binding of tau is critical for its physiological functions. It has been suggested that both an excess of microtubule-bound tau and an excess of free, microtubule-unbound tau can cause toxicity <[56]>. Since tau phosphorylation at Ser262 promotes tau detachment from microtubules <[32]>, <[33]>, Ser262 phosphorylation by MARK/PAR-1 plays critical roles under both physiological and pathological conditions. Thus, when axonal distribution of vesicles and organelle are reduced by tau, detachment of tau can play a protective role by temporarily enhancing microtubule-dependent transport <[54]>. However, our results suggest that, under pathological environments in which axonal mitochondria are chronically depleted, microtubule-unbound, free, Ser262-phosphorylated tau in the axons may become toxic and cause neurodegeneration.We found that the levels of active PAR-1 are increased by milton knockdown (<Figure 6>). PAR-1 is activated by various stress stimuli such as high osmolarity and amyloid precursor protein accumulation in Drosophila
<[37]>. Our results suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria may trigger a process that increases the levels of active PAR-1. However, the detailed mechanisms by which milton knockdown increases the levels of active PAR-1 require further investigations. PAR-1 activity is regulated by various kinases including LKB1, aPKC, and Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) <[37]>, <[57]>, <[58]>. A recent report demonstrated that PAR-1 protein levels were regulated by the Drosophila homolog of adducin, a cytoskeletal protein involved in regulating actin filament dynamics <[59]>. Milton knockdown may act through one or a combination of the mechanisms to increase the level of active PAR-1.Detachment of tau from microtubules has been suggested to initiate its abnormal metabolism and toxicity of tau in AD pathogenesis <[56]>, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study shows that loss of axonal mitochondria promotes detachment tau from microtubules and enhances tau-mediated neurodegeneration, and tau phosphorylation at AD-related Ser262 by PAR-1 plays a critical role in this process. Our results also suggest that an increase in Ser262-phosphorylated, microtubule-unbound tau may contribute to neurodegeneration under pathological conditions in which axonal mitochondria is depleted. An important question is how free, microtubule-unbound, Ser262-phosphorylated tau causes neurodegeneration under such pathological conditions. Loss of axonal mitochondria would disrupt multiple signaling pathways in the axon, and those changes may further enhance toxicity of tau. Elucidation of such mechanisms will further our understanding of tau-mediated neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of AD."
PMC3431335_6,"In summary, this study highlights a potential role of loss of axonal mitochondria in tau phosphorylation and toxicity in AD pathogenesis  Reductions in the function and number of mitochondria in the axon have also been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <[60]>. Our study raises an interesting possibility that mitochondrial mislocalization may cause abnormal metabolism and toxicity of other disease-related, aggregation-prone proteins. Transgenic fly lines carrying UAS-luciferase RNAi were established following the method described previously <[61]>. Target sequences were amplified by PCR from luciferase cDNA using primers (for, , rev,  ), and the resulting constructs were subcloned into the pUAST Drosophila transformation vector and microinjected into fly embryos of the w1118 genotype. Transgenic fly lines carrying UAS-Miro RNAi were established by microinjecting the Miro RNAi construct (a kind gift from Dr. Barry Dickson (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Austria)) into fly embryos of the w1118 genotype. The transgenic fly lines carrying S262A mutant tau was described previously <[36]>. Other fly stocks are listed in <Table S1>. Fly genotypes used in each experiment are listed in <Table S2>. Probosces were removed from decapitated heads, which were then immersion-fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at 4°C. Samples were post-fixed 1 hr in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer on ice. After washing, samples were stained en bloc with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 hr, dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in Epon. Thin-sections (70 nm) of laminas, in which photoreceptor axons were cut longitudinally, were collected on copper grids. The sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol and Reynolds' lead citrate solution. Electron micrographs were obtained with a VELETA CCD Camera (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GMBH) mounted on a JEM-1010 electron microscope (Jeol Ltd.). Preparation of paraffin sections, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and analysis of neurodegeneration were described previously <[53]>. To analyze internal eye structure, heads of female flies were fixed in Bouin's fixative (EMS) for 48 hr at room temperature, incubated 24 hr in 50 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (6 µm thickness) through the entire heads were prepared, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Vector), and examined by bright-field microscopy. Images of the sections that include the lamina were captured with Insight 2 CCD Camera (SPOT), and vacuole area was measured using Image J (NIH). Heads from more than five flies (more than 10 hemispheres) were analyzed for each genotype. Twenty fly heads for each genotype were homogenized in SDS-Tris-Glycine sample buffer, and the same amount of the lysate was loaded to each lane of multiple 10% Tris-Glycine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk (Nestle), blotted with the antibodies described below, incubated with appropriate secondary antibody and developed using ECL plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) or imaging with an Odyssey system. One of the membranes was probed with anti-tubulin, and used as the loading control for other blots in each experiment. Anti-tau monoclonal antibody (Tau46, Zymed), and anti-tau pSer262 (Biosource and Calbiochem), phospho-Thr231 (AT180, Thermo and Endogen), anti-HA (Santa Cruz), anti-myc (Millipore), anti-active p44mapk (Promega), anti-tubulin (Sigma), anti-GFP (Clontech) were purchased. Anti-tau pS202 (CP13) was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Davis (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Anti-PAR-1 pT408 was described previously <[37]>. The signal intensity was quantified using ImageJ (NIH) or an Odyssey system. Western blots were repeated a minimum of three times with different animals and representative blots are shown. Flies used for Western blotting were 3–5 day-old after eclosion. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed as described previously <[53]>. More than thirty flies for each genotype were collected and frozen. Heads were mechanically isolated, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with an additional centrifugation step (11,000× g for 10 min) to remove cuticle membranes prior to the addition of chloroform. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the resulting cDNA was used as a template for PCR on a 7500 fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The average threshold cycle value (Ct) was calculated from five replicates per sample. Expression of genes of interest was standardized relative to actin, rp49 or TBP. Relative expression values were determined by the deltaCt method according to quantitative PCR Analysis User Bulletin (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed using Primer-Blast (NIH).milton for

Fifty heads from adult flies expressing the human tau protein with the gmr-GAL4 driver were collected and homogenized in 150 µl of Buffer-C+ [50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid pH 7.1, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)] in the presence of taxol 20 µM (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in dimethylsulfoxide. After centrifugation at 1,000× g for 10 min, aliquot of supernatant was subjected to Western blotting as the “total fraction”. The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 2 volume cushion of buffer-C+ with 50% sucrose. After centrifugation at 100, 000× g for 30 min, the upper fraction containing soluble tubulin was collected as the microtubule-free fraction and the pellet containing microtubule polymers and proteins bound to microtubules was resuspended in 150 µl of SDS-Tris-Glycine sample buffer. Protein concentration in each fraction was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). The same amount of protein was loaded to each lane of Tris-Glycine gels and analyzed by western blotting using anti-tau antibody (Tau46, Zymed) or anti-tubulin (Sigma). For quantification, the signal intensity in each lane was quantified with an Odyssey system. Statistics was done with the JMP software (SAS) with Student's t or Tukey-Kramer HSD.

Abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of a microtubule-associated protein tau are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, what pathological conditions trigger tau abnormality in AD is not fully understood. A reduction in the number of mitochondria in the axon has been implicated in AD. In this study, we investigated whether and how loss of axonal mitochondria promotes tau phosphorylation and toxicity in vivo. Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human tau, we found that RNAi–mediated knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, enhanced human tau-induced neurodegeneration. Tau phosphorylation at an AD–related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1."

PMC5412442_0,"High incidence rate of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau are the hallmarks of AD. Hyperphosphorylated tau has been detected in diabetic animals as well as in diabetic patients. Folates mediate the transfer of one carbon unit, required in various biochemical reactions. The effect of folate on tau phosphorylation in diabetic models still remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of folic acid on hyperphosphorylation of tau in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Diabetic mice induced by STZ, at the age of 10 weeks, were administered with three levels of folic acid: folic acid-deficient diet, diet with normal folic acid content, and 120 μg/kg folic acid diet for 8 weeks. Levels of serum folate and blood glucose were monitored. Tau phosphorylation, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) methylation, and Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation were detected using Western blot. The S-adenosyl methionine:S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio (SAM:SAH) in brain tissues was also determined. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA expression levels were detected using real-time PCR. Folic acid reduced tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396 in the brain of diabetes mellitus (DM) mice. In addition, PP2A methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression were significantly increased in DM mice post folic acid treatment. GSK-3β phosphorylation was not regulated by folic acid administration. Folic acid can reduce tau phosphorylation by regulating PP2A methylation in diabetic mice. These results support that folic acid can serve as a multitarget neuronal therapeutic agent for treating diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction. This research was supported by grants received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (number 81373002, 81202200). Epidemiological studies show high incidence rate of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in patients with type 2 diabetes [<1>,<2>,<3>]. A number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have examined the association between type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and cognitive impairment [<4>,<5>], mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia [<6>]. Extracellular senile plaques (SP) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the hallmarks of AD. Amyloid-β (Aβ), a peptide derived from the amyloid protein precursor (APP), and hyperphosphorylated tau are the major components of senile plaques and NFTs respectively [<7>].Tau is a neuronal cytoskeletal protein responsible for microtubulin polymerization and stabilization. It suggests that tau, a microtubule associated protein, also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD as Aβ. Aberrantly hyperphosphorylated tau fails to bind and stabilize microtubules, resulting in destabilization of the cytoskeleton and perturbation of axonal transport [<8>]. Hyperphosphorylated tau has been previously detected in brain of experimental diabetic animal [<9>,<10>] as well as in diabetic patients [<11>,<12>]. Furthermore, phosphorylation of tau can be triggered by high glucose in hippocampal neurons [<13>]. It can be seen that hyperphosphorylated tau is one of the common pathological changes of both AD and DM.Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the major brain serine/threonine protein phosphatase that can dephosphorylate tau at multiple sites. Post-mortem AD brains had reduced PP2A expression and activity while inhibition of PP2A resulted in AD-like tau pathology and cognitive impairment in animal models [<14>,<15>,<16>]. Factors affecting PP2A amount and activity are still emerging; however, at least two mechanisms are known to be involved: methylation and phosphorylation [<17>,<18>].PP2A is composed of A, B and C subunits. Methylation of subunit C at Leu-309 by means of a specific S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase affects the substrate specificity of it. PP2A might link tau phosphorylation to homocysteine (Hcy) and SAM metabolism [<19>,<20>]. This suggests a possible effect of dietary factors related to one carbon unit metabolism on the process of neurodegeneration.Diabetes can induce perturbations of methyl group and homocysteine metabolism. Plasma hcy concentration was found higher in DM patients [<21>]. Genomic DNA was hypomethylated in liver of diabetic rats [<22>]. Folate mediates the transfer of one carbon unit required in various biochemical reactions. It plays a critical role in the synthesis of SAM, which serves as the methyl group donor in several methylation reactions involving DNA, RNA, and protein [<23>]. Folic acid supplementation in patient with type 2 DM can reduce Hcy levels and have a trend to associate with better glycemic control compared with placebo [<24>]. So, we hypothesized that folic acid may reduce tau phosphorylation by regulating methyl metabolism under diabetic conditions.We had previously demonstrated that folic acid could downregulate tau protein phosphorylation by inhibiting the demethylation reactions of PP2A in SH-SY5Y cells [<25>]. Nicolia et al. demonstrated that Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and PP2A genes were upregulated by vitamin B deficiency-mediated inhibition of methylation reactions [<18>]. Sontag et al. indicated folate-deficient diets have brain-region-specific alterations in PP2A methylation in mice [<26>]. In the present study, we observed the effect of folic acid deficiency and supplement on tau phosphorylation and PP2A methylation in mice with DM. Post induction of diabetes in mice, the serum folate level was detected thrice during folate or insulin treatment. As shown in <Figure 1>, DM mice, fed with the folate-deficient diet (DM-FD), had lower serum folate concentrations (p < 0.05) than those fed with the control diet (DM-FN). On the contrary, folic acid administration in DM mice (DM-FS) increased serum folate levels (p < 0.05). Insulin injection could reduce blood glucose significantly but not influence serum folate level. Folate deficiency or supplementation did not affect the blood glucose level during the entire experimental period. Besides Aβ deposition, abnormally phosphorylated tau is a major neuropathological characteristic of AD. In the present study, tau hyperphosphorylation was assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against phosphorylated site (Ser396) on tau. As shown in <Figure 2>, there was significant increase in tau phosphorylation at sites of Ser396 in both the hippocampal regions, CA3 and DG, in DM mice fed normal diet compared to that in the control group. Folate deficiency further enhanced tau phosphorylation in both regions. Folate supplementation inhibited tau phosphorylation only in the hippocampal DG region. No significant difference was observed for the pTau Ser396 expression level in the hippocampal area, CA3 between the DM-FS and DM-FN groups.Quantitative Western blot analysis of brain tissue of the DM mice got an increase in tau phosphorylation compared to the normal mice. Administration with folate revealed a significant decrease in tau phosphorylation compared to that in the DM mice fed with control diet. However, the pTau Ser396 expression level in DM-FD group exhibited an increasing trend, though statistically non-significant. Similarly, insulin treatment showed a decreasing trend on pTau Ser396 expression but statistically non-significant. Among several kinases involved in tau phosphorylation, GSK-3β has been implicated to play the most important role in its abnormal hyperphosphorylation. As shown in <Figure 3>, the western bolt result revealed that STZ treatment inhibited GSK-3β phosphorylation compared to normal mice. Folate deficiency or supplementation did not affect GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. GSK-3β phosphorylation was significantly high in DM-Ins group compared to that in the DM-FN group. PP2A dysfunction has been linked to tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloidogenesis, and synaptic deficits that are pathological hallmarks of AD. Deregulation of PP2A enzyme also affects the activity of many Ser/Thr protein kinases implicated in AD."
PMC5412442_1,"Quantitative Western blot analysis of mouse brain tissue extracts revealed that DM model induced by STZ treatment decreased PP2A methylation compared to normal mice  Meanwhile, folate deficiency inhibited PP2A methylation compared to DM mice fed with the control diet (<Figure 3>). Both folate supplementation and insulin injection stimulated PP2A methylation but not its expression. We determined whether the effects of folic acid deficiency or supplementation on tau phosphorylation were accompanied by changes in the methylation potential. As shown in <Figure 4>, folate deficiency increased SAH concentration and decreased SAM level, thereby reducing methylation potential (SAM:SAH ratio) in the brain tissue of DM mice. On the contrary, folate deficiency resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of plasma Hcy. However, neither folic acid supplementation nor insulin treatment significantly affected the methylation potential and plasma Hcy. DNMT gene expression was studied using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The results demonstrated a significant increase in the levels of DNMT1 mRNA in the brains of DM mice administrated with folic acid or insulin compared to that in the DM + FN group. Folate-deficient diet caused a significant decrease in DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA expression in the brains of STZ-treated mice. DNMT3b level did not show significant variation in the DM mice of the four groups. Epidemiological studies strongly suggest that diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for AD [<18>,<19>], although the causal relationship remains poorly understood. In an 11-year follow-up study of a Taiwanese population, diabetic patients were found to be more susceptible to AD compared to non-diabetic patients [<27>]. The link between AD and diabetes has been supported by studies using mouse models [<28>,<29>]. Pathological features of AD, including tau phosphorylation and amyloid plaque deposition, were exaggerated in the brains of APP transgenic mice following the induction of insulin-deficient diabetes [<28>].STZ is a diabetogenic substance used in diabetes research to induce insulin depletion after intraperitoneal injection. Recent study indicated that type 1 DM [<30>] model induced by STZ as well as spontaneous type 2 DM [<31>,<32>] model showed overexpression of phosphorylated tau at Ser396 cite. In the present study, we also found tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396 in hippocampus after STZ treatment in mice fed with the control diet, which further confirmed that insulin deficiency caused by STZ could increase phosphorylation of tau.GSK-3β and PP2A can both modify tau phosphorylation. Overexpression of GSK-3β can enhance tau hyperphosphorylation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain [<33>]. Down-regulation of PP2A is partially responsible for the abnormal tau phosphorylation in the brain. In the present study, phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 was significantly decreased by insulin deficiency after STZ injection, indicating increased GSK-3β activity. On the other hand, GSK-3β phosphorylation was enhanced by insulin treatment. These findings support that diabetes increases the risk for developing AD through the impairment of insulin signaling that leads to over-activation of GSK-3β and, consequently, abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau [<34>]. Increasing expression of demPP2A has been found in type 1 DM mice [<35>]. In our study, metPP2A was downregulated by STZ treatment, which also indicates diabetes leading to a progressive AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation by regulating PP2A methylation. The mechanism of low methylation status of PP2A in DM brains may be due to an increasing requirement for methyl donors in brain tissue under diabetic status [<36>].Folate is essential for transfer one-carbon units required for the synthesis of DNA/RNA and the methyl groups required to regenerate methionine from homocysteine. Several studies have investigated the relationship between DNA methylation with respect to type 2 diabetes [<37>]. We had previously shown that folic acid could inhibit tau phosphorylation through regulating PP2A methylation in vitro. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether folic acid could affect tau phosphorylation by modifying the major kinase and phosphates involved in this process and methyl potential in diabetic mice brain.During the eight weeks of our study, diets deficient and supplemented with folic acid lowered and increased serum folate levels, respectively. Blood glucose was not regulated by folic acid administration. Meanwhile, no serum folate changed by STZ and insulin treatment. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that folate deficiency further enhanced tau phosphorylation at Ser396 in both CA3 and DG hippocampal regions induced by STZ injection. Folic acid supplementation inhibited tau phosphorylation only in the CA3 region. Similar trends were seen in the Western blot results.Few studies explored the effect of folic acid on GSK-3β; some of them indicated that folic acid could regulate GSK-3β Ser9 phosphorylation or GSK-3β expression in model of cardiac teratogenicity [<38>] or patients with colorectal adenomas [<39>]. However, in the present experiment, we did not observe a significant difference in GSK-3β phosphorylation nor GSK-3β expression among the DM-FD, DM-FN, and DM-FS groups.In the present study, we analyzed PP2A methylation among DM mice, subjected to treatment with different levels of folic acid. Folic acid deficiency induced a decrease in methylated PP2A levels in the brain of DM mice. Similar downregulation of PP2A methylation and concomitant phosphorylation of tau and/or APP in the brain of AD mice caused by dietary folate and B-vitamin deficiency [<17>,<26>] and elevated homocysteine levels [<20>] have been shown previously. In the present study, folic acid supplementation caused an increase in methylated PP2A expression, as observed in our previous in vitro study. Those results supported that folic acid may serve as a neuronal therapeutic agent for treating diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.The methylation cycle metabolites and DNMT expression in the brain tissue of DM mice confirmed the effect of STZ and folic acid on PP2A methylation. A meta-analysis revealed that elevated Hcy level was causally associated with the increased risk of DM [<40>]. However, lower plasma Hcy concentration has been recorded in animal models of DM [<22>,<41>]. In the present study, STZ injection induced hypohomocysteinemia; an observation reported in previous works as well [<42>,<43>]. That may be the result of increasing folate-independent remethylation of homocysteine by betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), which is upregulated in DM status [<41>].Folate or other B vitamins—such as vitamins B6 and B12—are necessary for proper functioning of one-carbon metabolism pathway [<23>]. In the present study, folate deficiency restricted Hcy metabolism, resulting in brain and plasma SAH accumulation in STZ-treated mice. However, folic acid supplementation did not result in a significant increase of the SAM:SAH ratio in comparison to the group fed with diet comprising normal levels of folic acid. It seems that excessive supplementation of folic acid may be unnecessary for optimal maintenance of the methylation cycle [<38>].DNMT3a and DNMT3b establish DNA methylation patterns, and DNMT1 subsequently maintains it. Expression levels of DNMTs mRNA were downregulated in the STZ-treated mice in our study. The possible reason for abnormal maintaining of DNA methylation in DM mice may be related to more consuming of methyl donors in the process of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, which is regulated by phosphatidylethanolamine methyl transferase (PEMT) in diabetic mice brain [<36>]. Folic acid deficiency further downregulated DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA levels in DM mice. This may be associated with the increasing level of SAH, which is an inhibitor of DNA methylation. The effect of folic acid on DNMT expression varied with different models of diseases. For example, folic acid increased DNMT1 expression in breast cancer cell lines [<44>]."
PMC5412442_2,"However, hepatic DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression were elevated by folate-deficient diet in rat [<45>]  In our study, folic acid administration rescued the expression of DNMT1 mRNA, which was downregulated by STZ treatment. The mechanism of folic acid on regulating DNMTs is still unclear and needs further investigation. All study procedures were performed in accordance with protocol approved by the Tianjin Medical University Animal Ethics Committee (permission code: TMUaMEC 2012016; permission date: 20120506); 9–10-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The animals were housed in the Animal Housing Facility of Tianjin Medical University using polycarbonate cages with paddy husk bedding in the animal room. The room temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 22 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 10%, respectively, with a 12 h light/dark cycle.To induce diabetes in the mice, which were kept in fasted condition for 12 h prior to injection, a single intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg STZ (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), prepared in cold citrate buffer (0.1 M; pH 4.5), was administered per kg of mouse body weight. The same volume of citrate buffer was injected into the control group, instead of STZ.Blood was obtained from the tail vein of each mouse five days post-STZ injection. Blood glucose levels were monitored using a glucose meter. The mice with blood glucose level above 16.7 mmol/L were considered to be diabetic and used for the subsequent experiments. In total, 44 mice, successfully induced with diabetes, were divided into four groups: (1) folate-deficient diet plus daily gavage with water (DM-FD, n = 11); (2) control diet (normal folic acid content) plus daily gavage with water (DM-FN, n = 11); (3) control diet plus daily gavage with 120 μg/kg folic acid (DM-FS, n = 11); and (4) control diet plus daily gavage with water and insulin treatment (DM-Ins, n = 11). In the DM-Ins group, an injection with dose adjustments (2–3 units per kg mouse body weight of Glargine Insulin) was administered once daily to maintain the level of blood glucose within 10–16 mmol/L. In addition, the control mice were fed with the control diet and gavaged daily with water (NC, n = 11).The folate-deficient diet (0.2 mg/kg folic acid diet) and the control diet (2.1 mg/kg folic acid diet) were purchased from Test Diet (St. Louis, MO, USA). All the mice received food and drinking water ad libitum. Diets were administered for eight weeks.All mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. In order to assess the status of tau phosphorylation, the right half of the brain from five mice of each group was used for Western blotting, while the left half was used for immunohistochemistry of the phosphorylated tau protein. The right half of the brain from the other six mice of each group was used for real-time PCR, whereas the left half was used to perform HPLC for the evaluation of methyl potential. Serum folate levels were determined five days after STZ treatment and then every four weeks, using an automated chemiluminescence system (Immulite 1000; Siemens, Berlin, Germany).Tail vein blood glucose level was monitored by using a glucometer (Accu-Chek; Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Blood glucose test strips were used to measure the blood glucose concentration in mice.Plasma levels of Hcy were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Waters 700 HPLC Pump and a reversed-phase C18 column (5 µm bead size; 4.6 mm × 250 mm) (Waters, Milford, CT, USA). Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of 0.08 M acetate buffer and 5% (v/v) methanol adjusted to pH 4.0 by addition of concentrated acetic acid and then filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane filter. The isocratic elution was performed using a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 30 °C and a pressure of 100–110 kgf/cm2 (1500–1800 psi). A fluorescence detector with excitation at 390 nm and emission at 470 nm was used to detect Hcy. Before analysis of Hcy, the system was calibrated with authentic DL-homocysteine standards in the range of 50 to 4000 ng. Plasma Hcy was quantified relative to the standard obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). SAM, SAH, and the SAM:SAH ratio were determined in brain tissue samples. The brain tissue samples were homogenized using a motor-driven tissue homogenizer (PT1200E, Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). Next, 100 mg extracts of the brain tissue were resuspended in 300 μL 0.4 mol/L perchloric acid. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by loading into a Venusil MP-C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm particle, Agela Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) fitted with a matched guard column, run by HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Absorption of eluted compounds was monitored at λ = 254 nm with an ultraviolet detector. A two-buffer elution system was used: mobile phase A and B, both contained 4 mmol/L 1-heptanesulfonic acid (pH 4) and 10 mmol/L ammonium formate. The mobile phase B contained 50% acentonitrile by volume. Elution of SAM and SAH was achieved at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with the following parameters: 0–0.5 min, 100% A; 0.5–20 min, linear gradient to 75% A and 25% B; 20–30 min, 25% B; 30–45 min, 100% A. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA. A 20-μL reaction volume was incubated sequentially for 50 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 90 °C, 5 min at 5 °C. Real-time PCR was performed using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The 20-μL PCR mixture included 10 μL of PCR Master mix, 2 μL of cDNA, 1 μL of forward primer, 1 μL of reverse primer and 6 μL of water. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 45 amplification cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s; annealing at 61 °C for 10 s; extension at 72 °C for 10 s). Primers were specific for DNMT1 (forward, CCTAGTTCCGTGGCTACGAGGAGAA; reverse, TCTCTCTCCTCTGCAGCCGACTCA), DNMT3a (forward, GCCGAATTGTGTCTTGGTGGATGACA; reverse, CCTGGTGGAATGCACTGCAGAAGGA), DNMT 3b (forward, TTCAGTGACCAGTCCTCAGACACGAA; reverse, TCAGAAGGCTGGAGACCTCCCTCTT). The assay was performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 sequence detector (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The total protein was extracted from the brain tissues using a lysis buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by mixing of the supernatants with the loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Vantaa, Finland), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each well for 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then the resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with either 5% non-fat milk or 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-tau, 1:1000, CST, Framingham, MA, USA; anti-pTau Ser396, 1:5000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; anti-PP2A (C subunit), 1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; anti-demPP2A (C subunit), 1:5000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; anti-metPP2A (C subunit), 1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; anti-GSK-3α/β, 1:1000, CST; anti-Phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9), 1:1000, CST, Framingham, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 in TBST) for 2 h and detected by chemiluminescence. Quantitation of proteins was done by densitometric analysis using NIH Image software (version 1.61). The intensity of each protein band was normalized to the respective actin band (anti-β-actin, 1:5000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The brains were removed and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. The brains were coronally cut into 4-μm-thick sections using a vibratome. Free-floating sections were incubated with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h."
PMC5412442_3,"This was followed by incubation with monoclonal anti-pTau Ser396 protein antibody (TauPhospho S396, 1:1000, CST, Massachusetts, MA, USA) at 4 °C overnight  The sections were washed with PBS, reacted with biotinylated secondary antibodies (diluted 1:200 in PBS) and visualized using ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Imaging was carried out using a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The mean optical density (MOD) and total per area (TPA) of CA3 and DG area in hippocampus were determined with Image-Pro Plus 6.0. MOD/lg(255) × TPA was calculated to determine the expression level of pTau Ser396. Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. and analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data of serum folate and blood glucose were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Other data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA followed by a Student–Newman–Keuls test; p-values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In conclusion, tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396 was found in the brains of STZ-induced diabetic mice. Folic acid reduced phosphorylation of tau by regulating metPP2A expression. Changes of methyl donor and DNMT activity may explain the effect of folic acid on methylation of PP2A. rhetorical Figure 1 Experimental timeline and results of serum folate and blood glucose level.

Aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau are the hallmarks of AD. Hyperphosphorylated tau has been detected in diabetic animals as well as in diabetic patients. Folates mediate the transfer of one carbon unit, required in various biochemical reactions. The effect of folate on tau phosphorylation in diabetic models still remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of folic acid on hyperphosphorylation of tau in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Diabetic mice induced by STZ, at the age of 10 weeks, were administered with three levels of folic acid: folic acid-deficient diet, diet with normal folic acid content, and 120 μg/kg folic acid diet for 8 weeks. Levels of serum folate and blood glucose were monitored. Tau phosphorylation, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) methylation, and Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation were detected using Western blot. The S-adenosyl methionine:S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio (SAM:SAH) in brain tissues was also determined. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA expression levels were detected using real-time PCR. Folic acid reduced tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396 in the brain of diabetes mellitus (DM) mice. In addition, PP2A methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression were significantly increased in DM mice post folic acid treatment. GSK-3β phosphorylation was not regulated by folic acid administration. Folic acid can reduce tau phosphorylation by regulating PP2A methylation in diabetic mice. These results support that folic acid can serve as a multitarget neuronal therapeutic agent for treating diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction. ."
PMC5681345_0,"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders where TAU protein is presented as aggregates or is abnormally phosphorylated, leading to alterations of axonal transport, neuronal death and neuroinflammation. Currently, there is no treatment to slow progression of these diseases. Here, we have investigated whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an inducer of the transcription factor NRF2, could mitigate tauopathy in a mouse model. The signaling pathways modulated by DMF were also studied in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) from wild type or KEAP1-deficient mice. The effect of DMF on neurodegeneration, astrocyte and microglial activation was examined in Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice stereotaxically injected in the right hippocampus with an adeno-associated vector expressing human TAUP301L and treated daily with DMF (100 mg/kg, i.g) during three weeks. DMF induces the NRF2 transcriptional through a mechanism that involves KEAP1 but also PI3K/AKT/GSK-3-dependent pathways. DMF modulates GSK-3β activity in mouse hippocampi. Furthermore, DMF modulates TAU phosphorylation, neuronal impairment measured by calbindin-D28K and BDNF expression, and inflammatory processes involved in astrogliosis, microgliosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. This study reveals neuroprotective effects of DMF beyond disruption of the KEAP1/NRF2 axis by inhibiting GSK3 in a mouse model of tauopathy. Our results support repurposing of this drug for treatment of these diseases. rhetorical fx1 DMF mechanisms of action are partially KEAP1-dependent. Modulation of GSK-3β phosphorylation by DMF.

Tauopathies are a group of age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by the presence of protein aggregates with abnormally phosphorylated TAU <[1]>. TAU pathology is found in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Pick's disease, among others. The presence of insoluble TAU inclusions and neuronal loss in all of these diseases implies common mechanisms involved in cell injury and death, as well as neuroinflammation. Nowadays, there is no approved pharmacologic treatment for tauopathies that could target the cause of these diseases <[2]>. For example, to treat cognitive and behavioral symptoms, therapeutic agents such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have been used, but the outcome has not been consistent <[2]>. Recent research focuses on targeting TAU protein pathology, such as phosphorylation. The best studied TAU kinases are the proline-directed kinases Glycogen Synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), CDK5, MAPK (ERK), JNK (SAPK), and p38. GSK-3β is the major kinase to phosphorylate TAU both in vitro and in vivo and has been proposed as a target for therapeutic intervention <[3]>. Moreover, GSK-3β is a fundamental element in the down-regulation of the antioxidant cell defense elicited by the transcription factor NRF2 <[4]>.NRF2 was first described as the master regulator of redox homeostasis, but currently it is known to regulate the expression of about 1% of human genes, which contain in their promoter regulatory regions an enhancer sequence termed Antioxidant Response Element <[5]>. These genes encode a large variety of cytoprotective proteins implicated in biotransformation, antioxidant reactions, and inflammation, by modifying metabolic programs <[6]>. NRF2 is regulated principally by two different mechanisms. The best established mechanism is the control of protein stability by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). KEAP1 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase substrate adapter for a Cullin3/Rbx1-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex; henceforth binding of KEAP1 to NRF2 mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NRF2 <[7]>.The second mechanism is related to GSK-3, which phosphorylates NRF2 creating a recognition site for β-Transducin Repeat Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase (β-TrCP). β-TrCP leads to Cullin-1/Rbx1-mediated NRF2 ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation <[8]>. Since GSK-3β is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser9 by Ser/Thr protein kinases such as AKT, it has been suggested that NRF2 might be up-regulated through activation of AKT and permanent inactivation of GSK-3 <[9]>, <[10]>.Many NRF2 activators have been identified. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has consistently demonstrated to act in brain and to have neuroprotective effects <[11]>, with the added value of being an already approved drug for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis. The oral formulation termed BG-12, has been commercialized with the name of Tecfidera by Biogen <[12]>.Therefore, in this study we have analyzed the effect of DMF on several signaling pathways and induction of NRF2 signature. We have also used a clinically relevant dose of DMF to analyze its effect on neuronal plasticity markers and neuroinflammation in a preclinical mouse model of tauopathy. The end goal of this study is to validate DMF as a therapeutic drug for tauopathies, modulating NRF2 and GSK-3 signaling.

PMC5681345_1,"Whole brain lysates were prepared as described previously <[31]>  Immunoblots were performed as described in <[4]>. The primary antibodies are described in <Table 1>A. Keap1−/− and Keap1+/+ MEFs were seeded in p100 plates (2 × 106 cells/plate). MEFs cells were treated with DMF (20 μM) for different times. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (35). Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 10 min.

Colonies of Nrf2-/- mice and Nrf2+/+ littermates were established from funders kindly provided by Prof. Masayuki Yamamoto (Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan) <[14]>. Each experimental group comprised 5–8 animals. Recombinant AAV vectors of hybrid serotype 1/2 express mutant hTAUP301L under control of the human synapsin 1 gene promoter and were used as described <[15]>. Surgical procedures and unilateral intracerebral injection of viral particles into the right hemisphere were performed as described <[22]>. In brief, 2 μL viral suspension containing 10E8 t.u. was injected at the stereotaxic coordinates −1.94 mm posterior, −1.4 mm lateral, and −1.8 mm ventral relative to bregma. DMF (100 mg/kg) (Sigma-Aldrich) was suspended in 0.8% methocel (Sigma-Aldrich) and given by oral gavage. We did not detect significant weight loss, hair loss or other gross alterations in the DMF-treated mice either in the 3-weeks administration every day. The protocol was previously described <[31]>. Primary antibodies are described in <Table 1>A. Secondary antibodies were: Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse, Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:500, Life technologies, Madrid, Spain). Control sections were treated following identical protocols but omitting the primary antibody. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. To determine the statistical test to be used, we employed GraphPad Instat 3, which includes the analysis of the data to normal distribution via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In addition, statistical assessments of differences between groups were analyzed (GraphPad Prism 5, San Diego, CA) by unpaired Student's t-tests when normal distribution and equal variances were fulfilled, or by the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test. One and two-way ANOVA with post hoc Newman-Keuls test or Bonferroni's test were used, as appropriate. We wanted to corroborate the generally accepted concept that DMF targets KEAP1 by using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) from wild type (Keap1+/+) or KEAP1-deficient (Keap1-/-) mice. As shown in <Fig. 1>A, in Keap1+/+ cells, the basal levels of NRF2 were evenly distributed between cytoplasm and nucleus but DMF led to a prolonged nuclear accumulation of NRF2 starting at 1–2 h. In Keap1-/- cells, most of NRF2 was basally located in the nucleus. In these cells, DMF still induced a transient (1–2 h) but significant accumulation of NRF2 both in cytosol and nucleus. Consistent with this, DMF increased the mRNA levels of Nqo1, Osgin-1 and Hmox-1 in both cell types but with a delayed kinetics and lower intensity in Keap1-/- MEFs (<Fig. 1>B). Our results confirm the regulation of NRF2 in a KEAP1-dependent manner but most importantly, they also provide evidence of KEAP1-independent mechanisms. rhetorical Fig. 1 DMF activates NRF2 signaling through KEAP1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. A) Keap1+/+ and Keap1-/- MEFs were incubated in the presence of DMF (20 μM) for 1, 2, 4 and 8 h, and subcellular fractionations were analyzed by immunoblot: upper panel: NRF2 levels; middle panel: GAPDH levels used as cytosol protein loading control; lower panel: Lamin B level used as nuclear protein loading control. B) Keap1+/+ and Keap1-/- MEFs were treated with DMF and mRNA levels for Nqo1, Osgin1 and Hmox1 were determined by qRT-PCR, normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. We wanted to corroborate the generally accepted concept that DMF targets KEAP1 by using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) from wild type (Keap1+/+) or KEAP1-deficient (Keap1-/-) mice.

Our results confirm the regulation of NRF2 in a KEAP1-dependent manner but most importantly, they also provide evidence of KEAP1-independent mechanisms.Fig. 1 Previous evidence indicate that NRF2 is controlled by mechanisms other than KEAP1. For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling system responds to oxidative stress, and has been implicated in NRF2 activation <[14]>. Moreover, our group has described that PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 pathway is essential in NRF2 regulation <[8]>. Wild-type MEFs treated with DMF (20 μM) showed a time-dependent response effect activating phosphorylation of ERK (<Fig. 2>A, B) and p38 (<Fig. 2>A, C), that was maximal within 5 min. The Ser/Thr protein kinase AKT, an upstream regulator of GSK-3β, was also activated after 5 min as determined by increased phosphorylation of S473 (<Fig. 2>A, D), paralleling similar kinetics of inactivating phosphorylation of GSK-3βSer9 (<Fig. 2>A, E)."

Furthermore, MEFs from transgenic mice that overexpress phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (PTENtg) by ∼3-fold relative to control littermates (PTENwt) exhibited impaired NRF2 activity under basal conditions or after treatment with DMF. Thus, DMF (20 μM, 6 h) increased NRF2 and NQO1 protein expression (<Fig. 2>H-J), while this induction was reduced in PTENtg-MEFs. Interestingly, expression of the NRF2-regulated gene Nqo1 (<Fig. 2>G), but not Nrf2 (Nfe2l2) was significantly impaired in PTENtg-MEFs, (<Fig. 2>F). Taken together, these results indicate that activation of the NRF2 pathway by DMF implicates KEAP-1-dependent and independent mechanisms that control its protein stability, including the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β axis.Fig. 2 Changes in GSK-3β activity have been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, through modulation of several substrates which are involved in neuronal polarization by regulating microtubule dynamics, including collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) and TAU (<Fig. 3>A) <[15]>. To determine if DMF can modulate PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β in vivo as we found in vitro (<Fig. 2>) and its effects on a substrate like CRMP2, Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice were treated with DMF (100 and 300 mg/kg, i.g.) for one hour. Hippocampi of Nrf2-/- animals treated with vehicle showed increased inactivating phosphorylation of GSK-3βSer9 compared to Nrf2+/+ animals (<Fig. 3>B, D) which correlated with decreased levels of phosphorylated CRMP2 (<Fig. 3>C, E). DMF increased the phosphorylation levels of GSK-3βSer9 in both genotypes, indicating that this effect is upstream of NRF2 as shown in <Fig. 3>A. After one hour of DMF treatment, we could not observe a significant change in CRMP2 phosphorylation suggesting that one-hour treatment was sufficient to modulate GSK-3β phosphorylation status, but not to observe downstream effects. These results indicate that DMF modifies GSK-3β activity in mouse hippocampus. rhetorical Fig. 3 DMF modulates GSK-3β activity in mouse hippocampus.

A control adeno-associated virus vector expressing green fluorescence protein did not elicit significant changes in inflammation or gliosis (data not shown). Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice were injected with AAV-TAUP301L in the right hippocampus (ipsilateral side) and the left hippocampus was used as control (contralateral side). Animals received a daily administration of DMF (100 mg/kg, i.g.) by oral gavage, which started the same day as the mice were injected with the adeno-associated virus. Three-weeks after, we observed hTAU protein expression in the hippocampi of both genotypes (<Fig. 4>C), indicating that DMF did not influence AAV-TAUP301L expression. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in the non-injected side, there was not expression of either total hTAU or phosphorylated-hTAU in both genotypes (<Fig. 4>A). Interestingly, in hTAUP301L expressing neurons, we observed increased hTAU phosphorylation in Nrf2+/+ hippocampus, which was exacerbated in Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 4>A-B), in agreement with previous work by Jo et al. <[17]> and our group <[18]>."

Importantly, DMF significantly decreased hTAU phosphorylation in both genotypes (<Fig. 4>A-B).Fig. 4The phosphorylation status of CRMP2 has been associated with microtubule disassemble in Alzheimer's pathology. Therefore, we analyzed CRMP2 phosphorylation induced by TAUP301L (<Fig. 4>E) and the possible effect of DMF. TAUP301L did not significantly increase the levels of phospho-CRMP2 in agreement with lack of this modification in frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with mutations in MAPT or with Pick bodies <[19]>. Moreover, DMF showed a slight tendency to reduce the levels of phosphorylated CRMP2 at the lesioned side (<Fig. 4>D-E). Taken together, our results show that DMF reduces GSK-3 activity in vivo as determined by a significant and subtle reduction in the phosphorylation levels of its two substrates TAU and CRMP2 respectively. Twenty-one days of TAUP301L-expression did not induce noticeable hippocampal neuronal cell death as measured by Nissl-staining, FluoroJade or Bielschowsky-staining (data not shown). Therefore, we used an alternative and more sensitive method to analyze neuron damage based on calbindin-D28k expression, a major calcium-binding and buffering protein, that has a critical role in preventing neuronal death as well as maintaining calcium homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, calbindin-D28K containing neurons do not accumulate neurofibrillary tangles <[20]>. Immunofluorescence analysis with anti- calbindin-D28K antibody demonstrated that TAUP301L-expressing neurons do not express calbindin-D28K, neither in Nrf2+/+ or Nrf2-/- mice (<Fig. 5>A-B), indicating that TAUP301L- participates in dysregulation of calcium metabolism. Very relevant, DMF protected against calbindin-D28K loss in TAUP301L-expressing neurons of Nrf2+/+ mice (<Fig. 5>A). While DMF also increased calbindin-D28K levels in the Nrf2-/- mice, this expression was not at the TAUP301L-expressing neurons but in cells with glial morphology (<Fig. 5>A-inset), consistent with increased gliosis (see below). These results suggest that TAU-injured neurons in NRF2-deficient mice are sensitized to degeneration or at least to loss functionality and that DMF rescue effect, is NRF2-dependent. rhetorical Fig. 5 TAUP301Lexpression induces hippocampus degeneration which is prevented by DMF.A) Double immunofluorescence staining of 30 µm-thick sections of hippocampus from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice injected with AAV-TAUP301L.

Very relevant, DMF protected against calbindin-D28K loss in TAUP301L-expressing neurons of Nrf2+/+ mice (<Fig. 5>A).

These results suggest that TAU-injured neurons in NRF2-deficient mice are sensitized to degeneration or at least to loss functionality and that DMF rescue effect, is NRF2-dependent.Fig. 5To further characterize the impact of calcium dysregulation, we analyzed several calcium-dependent nuclear effectors including Downstream Regulatory Element Antagonist Modulator (DREAM), Myogenic Transcription Factor-2 (MEF-2), Npas4, Cpg15 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), all of which participate in synaptic connectivity. Messenger RNA gene expression levels of Dream, Mef2c, Npas4 and Cpg15 did not show significant variations in the hippocampus from these mice (data not shown)."
PMC5681345_4,"In connection with tauopathy, it has been described that BDNF levels are reduced in TAUP301L transgenic mouse brains <[21]>  BDNF has a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, playing a key role in neuroprotection. We observed that mRNA levels of Bdnf were significantly reduced by TAUP301L-expression in Nrf2+/+ mice treated with vehicle (<Fig. 5>C), indicating that TAU induced alterations in calcium homeostasis, according to the results observed above with calbindin-D28K. Interestingly, Nrf2-/- mice showed a compensatory increase in the mRNA levels of Bdnf but TAUP301L-expression decreased significantly this effect. Nrf2+/+ mice treated with DMF recovered Bdnf levels at the ipsilateral side, while Nrf2-/- mice did not, indicating that NRF2 deficiency exacerbates neurodegenerative processes. Consistently with these results, DMF increased Nqo1 and Osgin-1 mRNA expression at the hippocampi of Nrf2+/+ and to a lesser extend in Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 5>D and F, respectively). Nqo1 and Osgin-1 mRNA levels were also increased by TAUP301L expression even in the absence of DMF, suggesting that TAUP301L expression induces antioxidant response. These results suggest that TAUP301L expression induces alterations in two crucial mediators of calcium homeostasis, calbindin-D28K and BDNF, and that DMF prevents these effects mainly through NRF2. One of the main hallmarks of neurodegeneration is the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation that is characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis, in this case in the hippocampus. To evaluate whether DMF could modulate the gliosis triggered by TAUP301L expression, we analyzed by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR the expression levels of GFAP and IBA1, astrocytic and microglial markers, respectively. Regarding astrogliosis, TAUP301L toxicity correlated with a very significant increase in GFAP+ astrocytes at the ipsilateral hippocampal side of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 6>A), which was confirmed by stereological quantification (<Fig. 6>B). This reactive astrogliosis was significantly reduced by the treatment with DMF in Nrf2+/+ but not in Nrf2−/− mice, indicating that the anti-inflammatory effect observed is NRF2-dependent (<Fig. 6>A, B and C). Astrocytes displayed enlarged bodies and ramifications (Type B morphology), consistent with a reactive state after TAUP301L expression in Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 6>A left panels). However, only astrocytes from Nrf2+/+ mice treated with DMF were maintained in a resting morphology (Type A) (<Fig. 6>A right panels). Concerning microglia, TAUP301L expression induced a very significant increase in IBA1+ microglia at the ipsilateral hippocampal side of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 7>A), which was confirmed by stereological quantification (<Fig. 7>B). DMF treatment reduced significantly this microgliosis in Nrf2+/+ but not in Nrf2−/− mice, reinforcing the idea of NRF2-dependent anti-inflammatory effect (<Fig. 7>A, B and C). Regarding morphology, microglia can switch between a quiescent (type A), initiating microglial activation (type B), activated but non-phagocytic (type C) and a phagocytic state (type D) <[22]> (<Fig. 7> microglia morphology). We observed that microglia morphology was between activated but non-phagocytosis and phagocytic state (<Fig. 7>A left panels) after TAUP301L expression in both genotypes, and DMF treatment showed a microglial morphology related to a resting state (<Fig. 7>A right panels) only in Nrf2+/+ mice, corroborating an anti-inflammatory effect of NRF2 activation by DMF. Messenger RNA analysis of two pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) indicate that TAUP301L expression induce Il-1β (<Fig. 6>D) and iNOS (<Fig. 7>D) mRNA expression in both genotypes and DMF treatment decreased this expression only in Nrf2+/+ mice. Taken together, our results show that DMF has a beneficial therapeutic effect against tauopathy, modulating neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes. rhetorical Fig. 6 DMF attenuates TAUP301L-induced astrogliosis.

We observed that microglia morphology was between activated but non-phagocytosis and phagocytic state (<Fig. 7>A left panels) after TAUP301L expression in both genotypes, and DMF treatment showed a microglial morphology related to a resting state (<Fig. 7>A right panels) only in Nrf2+/+ mice, corroborating an anti-inflammatory effect of NRF2 activation by DMF. Messenger RNA analysis of two pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) indicate that TAUP301L expression induce Il-1β (<Fig. 6>D) and iNOS (<Fig. 7>D) mRNA expression in both genotypes and DMF treatment decreased this expression only in Nrf2+/+ mice. Taken together, our results show that DMF has a beneficial therapeutic effect against tauopathy, modulating neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes.Fig. 6 rhetorical Fig. 7 DMF attenuates TAUP301L-induced microgliosis.

PMC5681345_5,"One of the main hallmarks of neurodegeneration is the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation that is characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis, in this case in the hippocampus  To evaluate whether DMF could modulate the gliosis triggered by TAUP301L expression, we analyzed by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR the expression levels of GFAP and IBA1, astrocytic and microglial markers, respectively. Regarding astrogliosis, TAUP301L toxicity correlated with a very significant increase in GFAP+ astrocytes at the ipsilateral hippocampal side of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 6>A), which was confirmed by stereological quantification (<Fig. 6>B). This reactive astrogliosis was significantly reduced by the treatment with DMF in Nrf2+/+ but not in Nrf2−/− mice, indicating that the anti-inflammatory effect observed is NRF2-dependent (<Fig. 6>A, B and C). Astrocytes displayed enlarged bodies and ramifications (Type B morphology), consistent with a reactive state after TAUP301L expression in Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 6>A left panels). However, only astrocytes from Nrf2+/+ mice treated with DMF were maintained in a resting morphology (Type A) (<Fig. 6>A right panels). Concerning microglia, TAUP301L expression induced a very significant increase in IBA1+ microglia at the ipsilateral hippocampal side of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 7>A), which was confirmed by stereological quantification (<Fig. 7>B). DMF treatment reduced significantly this microgliosis in Nrf2+/+ but not in Nrf2−/− mice, reinforcing the idea of NRF2-dependent anti-inflammatory effect (<Fig. 7>A, B and C).

Taken together, our results show that DMF has a beneficial therapeutic effect against tauopathy, modulating neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes.Fig. 6Fig. 7 In the last few years, NRF2 has been suggested to be a novel target to slow down the progression of neurodegenerative disorders because it modulates main hallmarks of these diseases like proteinopathy, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Indeed, several drugs have been used for proof-of-concept studies indicating that activation of NRF2 may provide a benefit against Parkinson's disease <[11]>, <[23]> and amyloidopathy of Alzheimer's disease <[24]>, <[25]>, <[26]>, <[27]>, but there is little evidence about the role of NRF2 in tauopathies <[16]>.NRF2 is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system even at low levels, but here we demonstrate that DMF modulates several mechanisms of “brain protection”, essential in tauopathy. Related to the mechanisms that activate NRF2 signature after DMF treatment, our results demonstrate that part of the effects are KEAP1-dependent. This protein contains several cysteine residues that are capable of undergoing redox modifications and adduct formation with electrophilic compounds. Therefore, as expected, NRF2 levels could be modulated by DMF in part through this pathway. But NRF2 signaling can be also activated by other pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β. Our group has reported that GSK-3 phosphorylates critical residues of NRF2 to create a motif that is recognized by the E3 ligase adapter β-TrCP and therefore targets NRF2 for the ubiquiting-proteasome degradation. This proteolytic mechanism is complementary of the KEAP1 system but while KEAP1/NRF2 is a redox sensor, GSK-3/β-TrCP/NRF2 is a cell signaling sensor. The finding that DMF inhibits both proteolytic pathways provides two layers of up-regulation of NRF2 and may make this compound very useful for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly, where either KEAP1 of GSK-3 activities are altered.In this study we demonstrate for the first time that pharmacological treatment with DMF, by disrupting the KEAP1/NRF2 interaction and through the GSK-3β/NRF2 signaling pathway (<Fig. 3>A), provides a double mechanism of activation of NRF2 that might be used to treat TAU-related neurodegeneration. In our mouse model, where AAV-hTAUP301L is injected in the right hippocampus, TAU became hyperphosphorylated in Nrf2+/+ neurons and this effect was exacerbated in Nrf2−/− mice (<Fig. 4>) while DMF reduced this phosphorylation through GSK-3β deactivation in both genotypes. GSK-3 is a protein kinase that is abundant in the central nervous system and is one of the main kinases involved in the phosphorylation of TAU, a process that is crucial to the function of the protein <[28]>. The normal phosphorylation of TAU determines its affinity for microtubule binding, therefore pathological hyperphosphorylation induces the dissociation of TAU from microtubules and following aggregation to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Modulation of GSK-3β activity has been proposed as a target for therapeutic intervention <[3]>, but therapeutic benefits have not yet been observed. This suggests that the simple modulation of GSK-3 is not sufficient and it is also necessary to influence other aspects of the pathology such as inflammation to obtain a therapeutic benefit. Therefore, the double effect of DMF as an antioxidant modulator of neuroinflammation acting on NRF2 <[11]>, <[16]>, <[29]>, <[30]>, <[31]> as well as its role in GSK-3 inhibition provides a novel therapeutic approach that should be more efficient than a GSK-3 inhibitor alone.Although the AAV-hTAUP301L mouse model only resembles early stages of tauopathy without clear evidence of neuronal cell death, we observed changes in the expression levels of calbindin-D28K (<Fig. 5>A-B), which indicates a disturbance of calcium homeostasis, consistent with incipient neurodegeneration <[32]>. There is an inverse correlation between hTAUP301L and calbindin-D28K expression in Nrf2+/+ mice, which indicates that in hTAU+ neurons the calcium buffering capacity is impaired and most likely impacts on synaptic Ca2+ dynamics and plasticity <[33]>. On the other hand, our results show that DMF rescued TAU+ neurons of the Nrf2+/+ mice from calbindin-D28K depletion, therefore potentially recovering synaptic physiology. By contrast, in Nrf2−/− mice, DMF could not restore calbindin-D28K levels. Moreover, we observed an increased expression of calbindin-D28K in glial-shape cells, because DMF could not alleviate astro- and microgliosis. This observation is consistent with the fact that astrocytes also express calbindin-D28K in response to various central nervous system insults <[34]>.Related to Ca2+ signaling and synaptic activity, increased intracellular calcium induces the expression of BDNF <[35]>. In fact, BDNF slows down cognitive decline in the elderly, especially in advanced AD <[21]>. We observed that in Nrf2+/+ mice, TAUP301L expression decreased Bdnf mRNA expression in concordance with impaired Ca2+ signaling and synaptic activity and that DMF restored Bdnf levels. Furthermore, Nrf2−/− mice showed increased basal Bdnf expression in comparison to Nrf2+/+ mice and TAUP301L expression induced a drastic down-regulation which was not prevent by DMF treatment. These results suggest again that calcium homeostasis, which leads to changes in BDNF levels, is deregulated by TAUP301L expression, but can be restored by DMF through targeting of NRF2.Another hallmark of tauopathies is low grade chronic-inflammation, which is characterized by astrogliosis and microgliosis."
PMC5681345_6,"In this context, it has been largely reported that NRF2 restrains inflammation in several neurodegenerative models <[11]>, <[23]>, <[36]> in part by modulating NF-κB signaling <[29]>, <[30]>  Our results demonstrate that DMF attenuates astrogliosis (<Fig. 6>) and microgliosis (<Fig. 7>) and this effect is NRF2-dependent, as DMF had no effect on Nrf2−/− mice. These results were corroborated by stereological quantification and analysis of mRNA levels of GFAP and IBA1. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory activity of DMF in patients with multiple sclerosis may occur through alternative pathways independent of NRF2 <[37]>. Therefore, it is possible that DMF could elicit anti-inflammatory effects through several mechanisms depending on the disease.Related to neuroinflammation, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β is a key factor in several tauopathies <[38]>. Microglial activation and increased expression of IL-1β has been reported in PSP and FTLD-TAU patients, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and pathology. Moreover, exposure of primary neurons to IL-1β exacerbates TAU phosphorylation through aberrant activation of p38–MAPK <[39]>. In P301S transgenic mouse models, IL-1β or elevated inflammatory responses in the brain increase neuronal TAU phosphorylation and tangle formation <[40]>, <[41]>. Our results show a correlation between TAUP301L expression, TAU hyperphosphorylation and increased IL-1β expression, and at the same time, we find that DMF reduces TAU phosphorylation and IL-1β expression down to control levels, reinforcing the idea that NRF2 targeting modulates neuroinflammation.This study is the first to demonstrate the beneficial effects of DMF in a preclinical model of tauopathy, improving the outcome of the main disease-associated hallmarks. The fact that DMF decreased TAU phosphorylation, improved calcium homeostasis and BDNF expression and restrained neuroinflamation, astrogliosis and microgliosis positions DMF as a promising therapeutic strategy for tauopathies. Dimethyl fumarate is able to modulate different signaling pathways to provide protection against tauopathies. Our study validates the repurposing of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) to target GSK-3/NRF2 axis in the brain for treating tauopathies to start clinical trials. Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders where TAU protein is presented as aggregates or is abnormally phosphorylated, leading to alterations of axonal transport, neuronal death and neuroinflammation. Currently, there is no treatment to slow progression of these diseases. Here, we have investigated whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an inducer of the transcription factor NRF2, could mitigate tauopathy in a mouse model. The signaling pathways modulated by DMF were also studied in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) from wild type or KEAP1-deficient mice. The effect of DMF on neurodegeneration, astrocyte and microglial activation was examined in Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice stereotaxically injected in the right hippocampus with an adeno-associated vector expressing human TAUP301L and treated daily with DMF (100 mg/kg, i.g) during three weeks. DMF induces the NRF2 transcriptional through a mechanism that involves KEAP1 but also PI3K/AKT/GSK-3-dependent pathways. DMF modulates GSK-3β activity in mouse hippocampi. Furthermore, DMF modulates TAU phosphorylation, neuronal impairment measured by calbindin-D28K and BDNF expression, and inflammatory processes involved in astrogliosis, microgliosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. This study reveals neuroprotective effects of DMF beyond disruption of the KEAP1/NRF2 axis by inhibiting GSK3 in a mouse model of tauopathy. Our results support repurposing of this drug for treatment of these diseases. rhetorical fx1 DMF mechanisms of action are partially KEAP1-dependent. Modulation of GSK-3β phosphorylation by DMF.

PMC3704193_0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the extracellular accumulation of senile plaques composed of amyloid β (Aβ) and the intracellular accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau into both non-filamentous and filamentous inclusions, such as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuropil threads (NT) and neuritic plaques (NP) [<1>, <2>]. Tau’s primary role within neurons is thought to be the regulation and stabilization of microtubule dynamics [<1>, <2>]. During neurodegeneration however, post-translational modifications occur in vivo, which cause tau to undergo conformational changes resulting in its disassociation from the microtubule and self-association into aggregates [<2>]. One or more species of these aggregates is believed to be responsible for AD pathogenesis.The tau protein becomes highly phosphorylated in AD and this likely induces a conformational change causing its detachment from microtubules and its accumulation in aggregates [<3>]. Although there is much evidence linking tau to neurodegeneration, the precise mechanism of tau-mediated neurotoxicity remains to be elucidated. For many years, it was assumed that NFTs were the cause of neuronal toxicity, since they correlate very well with cognitive decline and neuronal loss [<4>, <5>]. However, in some animal models over-expressing tau, neurodegeneration has been demonstrated in the absence of overt NFT pathology [<6>, <7>]. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that memory function and neuronal loss can be restored in a tauopathy mouse model despite the ongoing accumulation of NFTs [<5>]. Moreover, NFTs have been suggested to persist in neurons for 20–30 years [<8>, <9>] making them unlikely candidates for catalyzing immediate toxicity [<10>]. In fact, a large immunohistochemical study on cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in the Nucleus Basalis using an early tau marker demonstrated pretangle neurons and neuropil thread staining correlates extremely well with cognitive decline which occurs prior to the emergence of significant NFT pathology [<11>]. Finally, synaptic loss correlates better with cognitive decline than NFTs, again suggesting the possibility of a different mechanism for tau toxicity [<12>]. If NFTs are not responsible for tau toxicity, what is the toxic species of tau. The existence of pre-fibrillar aggregates of recombinant tau in assembly assays in vitro has been known for some time [<13>]. Furthermore, the presence of tau-positive pre-tangle neurons lacking NFTs have been reported in AD brain tissue sections [<14>, <15>]; however, these inclusions do not react with dyes such as Thiazine Red, a compound which binds to the β sheet conformation indicative of NFTs [<16>, <17>]. The precise composition of these pre-fibrillar aggregates remains elusive [<18>–<20>]; also undetermined is their relationship to tau filaments that go on to form the NFTs. However, data from our lab indicate that these oligomers are toxic [<16>].In order to study non-fibrillar tau aggregates (oligomers), our lab generated a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes tau dimers and higher order aggregates [<16>]. This antibody, named Tau Oligomeric Complex 1 (TOC1) was made against stable photochemically cross-linked tau dimers. The resultant stabilized small aggregates migrated as trimers on SDS-PAGE but were confirmed to be dimers using SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry [<16>]. Time course aggregation analysis revealed that dimerization precedes tau oligomerization which, in turn, is an earlier event than the formation of full length filaments. Employing recombinant full length hT40, we observe the presence of oligomers at approximately 15 minutes after the addition of the anionic inducer arachidonic acid, while filament formation requires five – six hours to attain steady state (<Fig 1 A–C>). Immunogold labeling and dot blot analysis (data not shown) of aggregated recombinant hT40, reveals that TOC1 selectively labels these dimers or oligomers and appears not to label filaments (<Fig 1 G–I>). TOC1’s immunoreactivity is greatly elevated in AD brains compared to healthy controls, but co-localizes best with early stage markers for AD pathogenesis such as pS422 [<16>]. Furthermore, TOC1 does not colocalize with MN423 or Thiazine red, both late stage markers for mature NFTs [<16>]. Defects in axonal transport are prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases [<19>, <21>–<23>]. Microtubules within the cell are used as molecular tracks for motor proteins to carry their cargo to precise destinations within the cell [<24>, <25>]. There are two major classes of motor proteins: kinesin, which moves cargo towards the plus ends of microtubules in the direction of the synapse (anterograde transport) and dynein, which moves cargo towards the minus ends of the microtubules in the direction of the cell soma (retrograde transport) [<17>]. This fast axonal transport (FAT) is used by the cell to transport major membranous organelles such as mitochondria and synaptic vesicles [<19>]. There is increasing evidence that phosphorylation regulates this process in vivo, with much of this evidence stemming from data produced from studies performed on isolated axoplasm from the giant squid (Loligo pealii). Isolated squid axoplasm is particularly useful as it maintains its polarity, enabling direct investigations into the mechanisms controlling anterograde and retrograde transport [<23>, <26>, <27>].Previous work from our laboratory employed this model system to investigate the effects of aggregated tau on axonal transport. We discovered that aggregated tau inhibits FAT only in the anterograde direction at physiological tau levels while tau monomers had no effect on FAT in either direction, even at concentrations of tau > 10-fold higher than normal physiological levels [<19>, <24>]. Further investigation illustrated that this inhibition occurs via activation of a signaling cascade involving protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) [<24>]. Deletion analyses demonstrates that FAT inhibition requires a small stretch of amino acids (aa 2–18) located within the N-terminus that we have termed that Phosphatase Activation Domain (PAD) [<21>]. When the PAD region is removed from the tau protein, no inhibition of FAT occurs, indicating that PAD is both necessary and sufficient for anterograde FAT inhibition [<21>].Tau reportedly exerts an effect on axonal transport by interfering and reducing the attachment frequency of the motor proteins to the microtubules [<28>]. However, work from our group suggests that tau’s conformation plays an important role in its ability to affect axonal transport. Within monomers, we suspect that the PAD is hidden, being masked conformationally in something akin to the ‘paperclip’ conformation, whose existence was suggested by a FRET study [<29>]. This would explain why monomeric tau doesn’t inhibit anterograde FAT. However, when tau aggregates, this conformation is altered, exposing PAD and allowing activation of the PP1-GSK3 signaling pathway facilitating FAT inhibition [<21>].To further investigate the role of the PAD in FAT, our lab generated a monoclonal antibody directed against its 17 aa termed ‘Tau-N-Terminal 1’ (TNT1). Immunogold labeling of recombinant tau demonstrates that TNT1 detects predominantly, oligomers and filaments, although a limited reaction with monomers is apparent (<Fig 1 J–L>). However, in disease, TNT1 largely reacts with AD extracts containing soluble tau, exhibiting little reactivity to tau from extracts obtained from non-demented control subjects; this indicates that even soluble tau is altered in AD brains [<21>]. TNT1 also co-localizes in tissue with the phospho-epitope defined by the AT8 antibody, indicating that PAD exposure represents an early event in AD pathology. Previous data demonstrates that aggregated tau favors an Alz-50 conformation in which the C-terminus vacates its usual position in close proximity to the microtubule binding regions (MTBR’s) and allows the N-terminus to bind to the repeat regions [<30>]."
PMC3704193_1,"In pathological tau, it seems that the N-terminus remains in this conformation and the PAD remains exposed, causing aberrant activation of the PP1-GSK3 signaling cascade leading to inhibition of FAT [<21>]  However, the aggregated tau used in this initial investigation, included a mixture of both fibrillar and oligomeric tau. Therefore, it is difficult to elucidate which species is producing the toxic effects within the cell. Since we now appreciate that NFT’s are most likely not the toxic form of tau, this allows us speculate that these pre-fibrillar oligomers, recognized by both TOC1 and TNT1, may constitute a key player in neurodegeneration. Following our studies with TNT1 and PAD, we used the cell-free squid axoplasm model described above to investigate the effects of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 on tau toxicity [<31>]. This family of proteins has been implicated in AD, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease for some time [<32>, <33>]. Previous data indicates that Hsp70 prevents tau toxicity by preserving tau in its soluble form and preventing it from aggregating by binding to exposed hydrophobic residues [<33>]. It has also been demonstrated that Hsp70 can facilitate the degradation of pre-formed aggregates [<33>]. However, our data indicated that Hsp70 preferentially bound to oligomeric as opposed to fibrillar tau aggregates and prevented anterograde FAT inhibition [<31>]. This indicated that tau oligomers represent the main toxic species responsible for neurodegeneration associated with AD. Furthermore, when Hsp70 was pre-incubated with the PAD peptide and introduced to the squid axoplasm, inhibition of FAT was still observed [<31>]. This is noteworthy, as this suggests that Hsp70 does not directly interact with PAD. In summary, the findings discussed support our hypothesis that tau oligomers may be the toxic form of tau in neurodegenerative disease. Our novel tau antibody TOC1 selectively recognizes dimers and higher order oligomers over full-length filaments and co-labels with other early stage antibodies such as pS422, which suggests that these oligomers appear early in AD pathology [<16>]. These data raise the possibility that oligomers may be a pre-fibrillar intermediate that has been alluded to in the literature [<13>]. Utilizing the cell-free squid axoplasm as a model along with another novel antibody, TNT1 to investigate FAT, we illustrated that full preparations (filaments and oligomers) of aggregated recombinant hT40 could inhibit anterograde FAT only. Together these studies indicate that anterograde FAT inhibition is likely caused by a conformational change occurring within tau that results in an aberrant exposure of the PAD located within the N-terminus of tau, and that such a conformational change also occurs early in AD vulnerable neurons. Further use of the squid axoplasm model established that the chaperone, Hsp70 likely protects the cell against the toxic effects of tau aggregation by interacting with oligomers rather than filaments [<31>], allowing us to speculate that, in the presence of Hsp70, the conformation of oligomers is altered, obscuring the PAD and thereby reducing its toxicity (<Figure 2>). Hence, we hypothesize that tau oligomers represent the toxic species in AD and perhaps in other tauopathies, also. rhetorical Figure 1 A–C.

This leads to regulation of local cargo delivery through PAD-mediated activation of the PP1-GSK3 signaling cascade. Cargo is delivered along the microtubules via the motor protein kinesin. Cargo may be delivered at suitable locations once tau becomes extended exposing the PAD domain. B. In diseased states, when tau becomes aggregated or post-translationally modified, the PAD domain is exposed leading to dissociation from the microtubules, which promotes abnormal activation of the PP1-GSK3 cascade. This ultimately results in increased inhibition of anterograde FAT. C. Hsp70 binds to monomeric tau that has dissociated from the microtubule, therefore preventing tau aggregation. Hsp70 can also interact with tau oligomers, potentially preventing the extension of oligomers into filaments and/or inactivating oligomer toxicity by conformationally obscuring the PAD domain. ."
