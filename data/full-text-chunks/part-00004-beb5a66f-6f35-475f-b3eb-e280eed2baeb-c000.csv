PMC4992631_0,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau undergoes numerous modifications, including increased phosphorylation at serine-422 (pS422). In the human brain, pS422 tau protein is found in prodromal AD, correlates well with cognitive decline and neuropil thread pathology, and appears associated with increased oligomer formation and exposure of the N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). However, whether S422E phosphorylation contributes to toxic mechanisms associated with disease-related forms of tau remains unknown. Here, we report that S422-pseudophosphorylated tau (S422E) lengthens the nucleation phase of aggregation without altering the extent of aggregation or the types of aggregates formed. When compared to unmodified tau aggregates, the S422E modification significantly increased the amount of SDS-stable tau dimers, despite similar levels of immunoreactivity with an oligomer-selective antibody (TOC1) and another antibody that reports PAD exposure (TNT1). Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm further revealed that S422E tau monomers inhibited anterograde, kinesin-1 dependent fast axonal transport (FAT). Unexpectedly, and unlike unmodified tau aggregates, which selectively inhibit anterograde FAT, aggregates composed of S422E tau were found to inhibit both anterograde and retrograde FAT. Highlighting the relevance of these findings to human disease, pS422 tau was found to colocalize with tau oligomers and with a fraction of tau showing increased PAD exposure in the human AD brain. This study identifies novel effects of pS422 on tau biochemical properties, including prolonged nucleation and enhanced dimer formation, which correlate with a distinct inhibitory effect on FAT. Taken together, these findings identify a novel mechanistic basis by which pS422 confers upon tau a toxic effect that may directly contribute to axonal dysfunction in AD and other tauopathies.

Tau is a major microtubule-associated protein component of the neuronal cytoskeleton that plays an important role on the regulation of signaling pathways within axon (<Kanaan et al., 2013>). Under pathological conditions, tau transitions from a soluble monomeric state to oligomeric and filamentous aggregates, which accumulate as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques (<Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986a>; <1986b>; <Kosik et al., 1986>; <Wood et al., 1986a>). The accumulation of tau aggregates in various morphological states is characteristic of a number of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (<Spillantini and Goedert, 1998>). Pathological tau inclusions in these diseases display numerous abnormal alterations, some of which can facilitate aggregation and attenuate microtubule binding and stabilization (<Bierer et al., 1995>; <Biernat et al., 1993>; <Drewes et al., 1995>). At least 25 threonine/serine sites are phosphorylated in filamentous tau (<Morishima-Kawashima et al., 1995>); however, many of these phosphorylation sites are shared with normal tau protein derived from human brain biopsies (<Matsuo et al., 1994>). Additionally, NFT formation follows a prescribed sequence of events during disease progression; some sites are phosphorylated early in the pathogenic process, whereas other sites are not phosphorylated until after NFTs have already formed (<Kimura et al., 1996>; <Stoothoff and Johnson, 2005>). Hence, specific tau phosphorylation events contributing to disease-causing processes remain unclear. From this, it is essential to understand the effect of individual phosphorylation sites on tau aggregation and neurodegenerative mechanismsC-terminal phosphorylation of tau at serine-422 (pS422) is a disease-related modification that occurs early in the progression of AD (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Kimura et al., 1996>; <Vana et al., 2011>). In AD, pS422 tau is found in pre-tangle neurons (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>), and appearance of the pS422 epitope is a stronger correlate of disease neuropathology and cognitive decline than mature NFT deposition (<Vana et al., 2011>). Moreover, the lack of pS422 tau in cognitively intact control brain samples further supports the disease-specificity of phosphorylation at S422 (<Bussière et al., 1999>; <Hasegawa et al., 1996>). Evidence from animal models of AD supports this conclusion. For example, appearance of the pS422 epitope is dependent upon β-amyloid-induced NFT formation in transgenic mice expressing mutant P301L human tau protein (<Deters et al., 2009>; <Gotz et al., 2001>; <Grueninger et al., 2010>).Recent studies from our group and others have implicated two pathogenic events associated with disease-related forms of tau. First, conformational changes in tau that aberrantly expose the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD, amino acids 2-18) activate a PP1/GSK3β signaling pathways and promote inhibition of anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT) (<Kanaan et al., 2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>). The tau N-terminal 1 (TNT1) antibody, a monoclonal antibody raised against amino acids 2-18, demonstrates that PAD exposure is a disease-related event (<Kanaan et al., 2011>; <2012>). The pattern of TNT1-immunoreactivity indicates diffuse, granular cytoplasmic staining in pretangle neurons preceding the appearance of the early phospho-epitope AT8 in postmortem human tissue (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). Second, prefibrillar oligomeric species of tau are more potent inducers of neurodegeneration than fibrillar tau aggregates (<Berger et al., 2007>; <Kopeikina et al., 2011>; <Maeda et al., 2007>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>; <Sahara et al., 2013>). In this regard, a monoclonal antibody that preferentially labels tau oligomers (tau oligomeric complex 1; TOC1) (<Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986b>; <1986a>; <Kosik et al., 1986>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>; <Ward et al., 2013>; <Wood et al., 1986a>) displays elevated immunoreactivity in prodromal AD brains (mild cognitive impairment) (<Mufson et al., 2014>; <Spillantini and Goedert, 1998>), and does not colocalize with later events in tangle formation, such as truncation at residue 391 or formation of β-sheet structures (<Bierer et al., 1995>; <Biernat et al., 1993>; <Drewes et al., 1995>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>). Interestingly, pS422 accompanies PAD exposure and tau oligomer formation in early tau pathology observed in several brain regions (e.g. medial temporal lobe, temporal cortex and cholinergic basal forebrain) of Braak I-VI cases (<Kanaan et al., 2016>; <Morishima-Kawashima et al., 1995>; <Mufson et al., 2014>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>). However, whether S422 phosphorylation modulates PAD exposure or oligomer formation remains unknown.The present study sought to determine whether S422 phosphorylation modulates tau aggregation, PAD exposure, oligomer formation, and the toxic effect of aggregated tau on FAT. We present evidence indicating that pseudophosphorylation at S422 (S422E) lengthens the nucleation phase of tau aggregation kinetics, without altering the overall extent of aggregation or the types of aggregates formed."
PMC4992631_1,"We also demonstrate that, compared to unmodified tau aggregates, the S422E modification enhances the formation of SDS-resistant dimers without altering exposure of the TNT1 or TOC1 epitopes  Using vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm, we further report that S422E monomers and aggregates inhibit FAT. Lastly, we establish that the tau species isolated from human AD brain containing the pS422 modification also have PAD exposed (TNT1 reactive) and are in oligomeric conformations (TOC1 reactive). Collectively, these results provide evidence of a functional role for the pS422 disease-related modification in mechanisms of tau toxicity relevant to AD and other tauopathies. Full-length tau protein (hT40) corresponds to the longest isoform in the adult human brain, consisting of 441 amino acids and four microtubule-binding repeats. Pseudophosphorylation (i.e., switching serine to a glutamate) was used to mimic phosphorylation at position 422 in tau. Pseudophosphorylation is a routine approach to examine both single and multiple phosphorylation residues on the tau protein (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Jeganathan et al., 2008>; <Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009a>; <Matsuo et al., 1994>; <Necula and Kuret, 2005>). Pseudophosphorylated S422E tau was generated using mutagenesis of the hT40 construct per the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Agilent Technologies, 210515). The forward primer used in this reaction was: CAGCATCGACATGGTAGACGAGCCCCAGCTCGCCACGCTAG. pT7c plasmid DNAs containing either hT40 or S422E were amplified in XL10-Gold ultracompetent Escherichia coli, purified using the PureLink Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen, K2100), and verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed in T7 Express supercompetent Escherichia coli, and purified through C-terminal His-tag metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin, Clontech, 635502) followed by size exclusion chromatography using an S200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, 17-1195-01) as previously described (<Carmel et al., 1996>; <Kimura et al., 1996>; <Stoothoff and Johnson, 2005>). Tau polymerization was induced with arachidonic acid (ARA; Cayman Chemical, 90010) as previously described (<Gamblin et al., 2000>; <Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Kimura et al., 1996>; <LaPointe et al., 2009a>; <Vana et al., 2011>). Briefly, recombinant tau (2μM) was incubated in polymerization buffer (5mM dithiothreitol, 100mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 10mM HEPES, pH 7.6) with 75μM ARA (final concentration) at room temperature for 6 h. ARA was stored at −20°C, and working solutions were prepared in 100% ethanol immediately prior to use. Control (monomer) samples were prepared in polymerization buffer with ARA vehicle (i.e., 100% ethanol). A combination of right angle laser light scatter, thioflavin S (ThS), and transmission electron microscopy was used to validate tau aggregation. Tau polymerization was monitored in real-time by measuring the intensity of right angle light scatter (iS; (<Gamblin et al., 2000>; <Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>)). A 475 nm laser (B&W Tek, Inc., BWI-475-20-E) was used to illuminate polymerization reactions. Images of scattered light were captured throughout the 6h polymerization reaction using a high sensitivity CMOS digital camera (Thor Labs, DCC1240M) and imaging software uc480 Viewer version 4.2. Images were collected using an exposure time of 175.15 ms, a frame rate of 4.01 fps, and a pixel clock of 11 MHz. Individual images were imported into Photoshop CS5 Version 12.1 (Adobe Systems, Inc.) where the marquee tool was used to select a region of interest (75 × 10 pixels) within the scattered light near the middle of the cuvette. The intensity of scattered light was obtained using the histogram feature. The background intensity was subtracted by measuring scattering in the cuvette prior to the addition of ARA (<Gamblin et al., 2000>; <Vana et al., 2011>). Each experiment was repeated five independent times, and background-corrected light scatter data were plotted as a function of time. The polymerization kinetics curve was best fit with the sigmoidal Gompertz equation (<Bussière et al., 1999>; <Hasegawa et al., 1996>; <Necula and Kuret, 2004a>; <Winsor, 1932>). A 0.0175% solution of ThS (Sigma, #T1892) was prepared on the day of each experiment and filtered using a 0.2μm syringe filter before use. To measure ThS fluorescence, 6 μL of 0.0175% ThS was added to 150 μL of 2μM aggregated tau (hT40 or S422E) in a black 96-well plate (Fisher Scientific, 06-443-2), such that the final concentration of ThS was 0.0007%. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25°C in a GloMax Multi Detection System (Promega) with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 510-570 nm. Each experiment was repeated three independent times. To compare measurements from independent experiments, background fluorescence was measured in wells containing tau (hT40 or S422E) + vehicle (ethanol), and subtracted from each respective treatment condition. Aliquots of polymerized tau samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, spotted onto 300 mesh Formvar carbon coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 215-412-8400), and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined with a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus electron microscope at 80 kV and ×10,000 magnification. Images were captured with an AMT XR81 digital camera and AMT software version 602.6 (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). Tau samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1.6 μM to capture representative images of each polymerization reaction, or diluted to a final concentration of 0.2μM for quantitative TEM analysis. A higher dilution was used for the quantitative analysis to obtain samples with discrete, non-overlapping aggregates.Images were processed using Image J to measure total aggregate mass, individual aggregate area, aggregate number, and individual aggregate lengths (<Fig. S1>). For the individual aggregate measures (i.e., number and length) objects were separated into three categories based on area; 1) oligomers were <1000nm2, 2) short filaments were 1000 – 5000 nm2, or 3) long filaments were >5000 nm2. All images were captured at ×10,000 magnification with a standard beam intensity and gain for consistency across samples. A macro was used in Image J to measure total aggregate mass, individual aggregate area and aggregate number. The scale was set at 373.5 pixels equal to 400 nm. Images were smoothed twice to eliminate small variations in estimations of object area, and auto threshold was used to distinguish aggregates over background. Total mass of aggregated tau was determined by summating the area of individual aggregates (nm2) covering the field. Aggregate counts were performed for three populations of aggregates sorted by area: oligomers = < 1000 nm2, short filaments = 1000 – 5000 nm2, long filaments = > 5000 nm2. Aggregate length was not an output of the Image J macro, thus these measurements were made manually in Image J by measuring the distance along the longest axis of individual oligomers (100 per sample), short filaments (average of 24 per sample) and long filaments (average of 50 per sample). Each experiment was repeated three independent times, and five fields from each sample were randomly captured during each experiment and used for analysis. Soluble tau was prepared from frontal cortex tissue of non-demented control (n=6; age: mean=83yrs, range=75-95 yrs; sex: 4 female, 2 male; Braak stage II-III) and AD cases (n=6; age: mean=84 yrs, range=69-93 yrs; sex: 0 female, 6 male; Braak stage VI) as described previously (<Deters et al., 2009>; <Gotz et al., 2001>; <Grueninger et al., 2010>; <Kanaan et al., 2016>). Briefly, tissue pieces from cortex (0.5-1 grams) were homogenized on ice in ten volumes (1g=10ml) of brain homogenization buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 274mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 1mM PMSF, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin). The soluble tau fraction was collected in the supernatant following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 minutes at 4°C."
PMC4992631_2,"The samples were assayed for total protein concentration using the Lowry protein assay and stored at -80°C until used in sandwich ELISAs for analysis (see below)  A novel sandwich ELISA was developed to measure the relative levels of oligomer formation and PAD exposure in recombinant tau proteins and pS422-containing tau species in the frontal cortex from human brains samples. All steps were performed at room temperature. Washing was performed between each step using 200μL/well of ELISA wash buffer (100mM borate acid, 25mM sodium borate, 75mM NaCl, 0.25mM thimerosal, 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20), and all other steps were performed using 50μL solution/well. For recombinant tau protein sandwich ELISAs, the following capture antibodies were used: Tau5, TNT1, or TOC1. Tau5 is a monoclonal mouse IgG1 raised against bovine tau, with a continuous epitope between amino acids 215-225. Tau5 is a pan-tau antibody that labels monomeric and aggregated tau equally well (<Carmel et al., 1996>; <Kanaan et al., 2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>; <LoPresti et al., 1995>; <Porzig et al., 2007>). TNT1 is a monoclonal mouse IgG1 directed against N-terminal amino acids 2-18 (AEPRQEFEVMEDHAGTY), the PAD (<Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>). In native assays, reactivity of TNT1 is dependent upon conformational display of PAD, which is a disease-specific event (<Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>). TOC1 is a monoclonal mouse IgM raised against tau dimers (<Berger et al., 2007>; <Kopeikina et al., 2011>; <Maeda et al., 2007>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>; <Sahara et al., 2013>). The TOC1 epitope (amino acids 209-224) is conformation dependent as it is revealed upon dimerization and oligomerization of tau (<Ward et al., 2013>). High binding 96-well microplates (Fisher Scientific, 07-200-35) were coated with Tau5 (1μg/ml), TNT1 (2μg/ml) or TOC1 (2μg/ml) capture antibody diluted in borate saline (100mM borate acid, 25mM sodium borate, 75mM NaCl, 0.25mM thimerosal) for 60 min. Plates were washed twice with ELISA wash buffer, and then blocked for 60 min with ELISA wash containing 5% non-fat dry milk (blocking reagent). Each well was washed twice and then recombinant tau samples were added to each well for 90 min. Recombinant hT40 and S422E tau monomers or aggregates from the in vitro polymerization assays were diluted with polymerization buffer to a final concentration of 5nM (Tau5 and TNT1 assays) or 20nM (TOC1 assay). Titer assays were performed for each capture antibody sandwich ELISA to ensure recombinant tau protein concentrations produced signal within the linear range. Wells were rinsed 3 times with ELISA wash and then incubated for 90 min with the rabbit polyclonal pan-tau antibody R1 (<Berry et al., 2004>) diluted 1:20,000 in blocking reagent, as the detection antibody. Wells were washed 3 times, and then incubated for 60 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Vector Labs, PI-1000) diluted in blocking reagent. Wells were washed 3 times, and assays were developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma) for 15 min (Tau5, TNT1) or 30 min (TOC1). Development reactions were stopped with 3.5% sulfuric acid and absorbance was read at 450nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The amount of total tau applied in the assay was known and equivalent between groups since these are recombinant protein samples, but absorbance (A) is not a linear measure (i.e., A=Log10 (1/transmittance) and not useful for comparing across samples (e.g. A=0.3 is 50% light absorbed, A=1 is 90% light absorbed and A=2 is 99% light absorbed). Thus, the absorbance data were converted to percent light absorbed (a linear scale) using the following equation %A=(1–10-x)*100, where x is absorbance. The percent light absorbed data were used for statistical comparisons across groups.A similar protocol was used to measure the levels of PAD exposure and tau oligomers in pS422-containing tau species in the soluble tau fractions of the frontal cortex from control and AD brains (<Kanaan et al., 2016>). Tau species containing pS422 protein were captured by coating ELISA microplates for 60 min with rabbit anti-pS422 antibody (Abcam, ab79415, diluted to 2μg/ml in borate saline). Plates were rinsed twice, blocked for 60 min with blocking reagent, and rinsed twice before samples were added to the well for 90 min. Human brain extracts were diluted to a final total protein concentration of 0.4 μg/μL (i.e., 20 μg/well). The optimal protein amount for the soluble tau fraction was determined by titering to ensure the ELISAs were performed within the linear rage of reactivity. Wells were rinsed twice, and then incubated for 90 min with Tau5 (0.005μg/ml), TNT1 (0.01μg/ml) or TOC1 (1μg/ml) as the detection antibodies (diluted in blocking reagent). Wells were rinsed 3 times and incubated for 90 min with horse anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Labs, PI-2000) or goat anti-mouse IgM-specific conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson, 115-035-020) diluted (0.2μg/ml) in blocking reagent. The wells were rinsed 3 times, signal was detected by developing TMB for 6 min (TOC1) or 30 min (Tau5 and TNT1), and then the reaction was stopped using 3.5% sulfuric acid. Tau standard ELISAs were performed with human sample sandwich ELISAs to estimate the amount of tau captured by anti-pS422 and detected with Tau 5, TNT1 or TOC1. For the tau standards, a serial dilution of recombinant full-length human tau protein ranging from 100-3.13 ng was bound to the ELISA plate for 60 min, blocked as above, and detected using either Tau5, TNT1 or TOC1 antibodies and HRP-secondary antibodies exactly as in the recombinant protein sandwich ELISAs above. Each standard was run in duplicate and developed simultaneously with the sandwich ELISAs to ensure accurate interpolation of unknown tau amounts. The standard curve data were log10 transformed and best fit to a sigmoidal curve (r2=0.99 for all three). This provided a standard curve of absorbance values that were derived from Tau5, TNT1 or TOC1 reactivity with known amounts of tau protein. The quantity of tau (ng) in each human sample was interpolated from the tau standard curves and then converted to a concentration of ng/μL by dividing the interpolated quantity by the volume of the sample used (i.e., 50μL). Finally, the data (i.e., concentrations of tau) were normalized to reduce skewness using logarithmic transformations and then used for statistical comparisons. Monomeric and aggregated tau samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (20mM Tris pH 6.8, 6% glycerol (v/v). 1.6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (v/v), 0.85% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.002% bromophenol blue (v/v)), incubated at 90°C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Criterion TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., 5671094) and transferred to 0.22 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corporation, 66485). Membranes were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubated overnight at 4°C in Tau13 antibody (1:50,000), a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody against the N-terminus of tau (<García-Sierra et al., 2003>). Membranes were rinsed four times in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and developed with the affinity-purified secondary antibody conjugated to IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (LiCor, 925-68070). Image acquisition and intensity measurements were performed using a LiCor Odyssey system. FAT was evaluated in freshly extruded squid axoplasm from giant squid axon (Loligo pealii; Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA) as previously described (<Brady et al., 1993>; <Morfini et al., 2007>; <Song et al., 2016>). Tau protein (monomer or aggregate) was diluted in X/2 buffer (175 mM potassium aspartate, 65 mM taurine, 35 mM betaine, 25 mM glycine, 10 mM HEPES, 6.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5mM glucose, 10mM adenosine triphosphate, pH 7.2) and perfused into isolated axoplasm at a final concentration of 2 μM. The tau protein concentration of 2 μM was chosen specifically because it is within the physiological range of tau in the brain (<Alonso et al."
PMC4992631_3,", 1996>; <King et al , 1999>). Motility was analyzed using a Zeiss Axiomat microscope equipped with a 100× (1.3 numerical aperture) objective and differential interference contrast optics. Images were obtained using a Hammamatsu C2400 CCD with an Argus 20 for image adjustment and the video was further processed using a Hamamatsu Photonics Microscopy C2117 video manipulator for generation of calibrated cursors and scale bars (<Song et al., 2016>). Anterograde and retrograde FAT were measured by matching calibrated cursor movements to the speed of vesicles moving in the axoplasm preparation. Vesicle motility was measured for 50 min after perfusion and data were plotted as a function of time. Full-length hT40 monomer was used as the control group since no changes are observed for this experimental group when compared to buffer control-perfused axoplasms (<LaPointe et al., 2009b>; <Morfini et al., 2007>). Two comparisons were made between groups: i) the average velocity of transport over the last 20 min of the assay was compared to measure the extent of inhibition across treatment groups, and ii) the rate of change in transport velocity over the entire 50 min assay was evaluated by comparing the slope of the linear regression curve fit for each group. Triple-label IF was used to characterize co-localization between tau phosphorylated at S422, PAD exposed tau and oligomeric tau. Tissue sections from age-matched, non-demented controls (n=6; age: mean=81 yrs, range=73-91 yrs; sex: 1 female, 5 males; Braak stage I-III) and severe AD cases (n=6; age: mean=83, range=60-92 yrs; sex: 4 female, 2 males; Braak stage V-VI) were processed for triple-label IF using the TNT1 (mouse IgG1), TOC1 (mouse IgM) and pS422 (rabbit) antibodies according to published methods (<Kanaan et al., 2016>). The sections were incubated overnight at 4° C in a primary antibody solution containing TNT1 (1:30,000), TOC1 (1:2,000) and pS422 (1:1,000) antibodies followed by incubation in a secondary antibody solution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1-specific (Invitrogen, A-21121), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgM-specific (Invitrogen, A-21043), and Alexa Fluor 405 goat anti-rabbit specific (Invitrogen, A-31556) antibodies (all diluted 1:500) for 2 hours. Following the staining procedure, sections were mounted on microscope slides, autofluorescence was blocked using sudan black as described (<Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <2007>), and coverslipped using hardset Vectashield mounting media. Control sections with one of the three primary antibodies omitted confirmed that each secondary label was specific to the appropriate primary antibody (i.e., no staining was observed with the fluorophore for the omitted antibody; data not shown). A Nikon A1+ laser scanning confocal microscope system equipped with solid-state lasers (488, 561, and 640) and Nikon Elements AR software were used to acquire image z-stacks (0.5μm step size), and the images (maximum intensity projections) were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. All experiments were repeated at least three times (see figure legends). All experiments were analyzed by Student's t-test or two-way analysis of variance as indicated in figure legends. When overall significance was achieved, the Holm-Sidak post-hoc test was used to make all possible comparisons. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. All tests were two-tailed, and significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical tests. Recombinant tau protein (2μM) was induced to aggregate with ARA (75μM) to determine whether pseudophosphorylation at S422 influences tau polymerization characteristics. Aggregation was monitored in real-time for 360 min by right-angle LLS (<Fig. 1>). The data were best fit to the Gompertz sigmoidal function to evaluate polymerization kinetics (<Table 1>). The time to initiate polymerization (i.e., lag time or nucleation time) for S422E tau (8.5 ± 1.7 min) was 1.85 times longer than hT40 tau (4.6 ± 0.6 min). However, the rate of polymerization (kapparent) did not differ between hT40 tau and S422E tau. At 360 min, a similar intensity of light scattering was observed for hT40 (122.5 ± 1.2) and S422E tau (134.5 ± 1.7) indicating that the extent of aggregate formation was comparable between these two proteins. ThS fluorescence, measured at 360 min, also was comparable between hT40 aggregates (946.4 ± 73.8) and S422E aggregates (927.9 ± 63.7).Quantitative analysis of polymerized hT40 and S422E samples was performed on TEM micrographs to verify the results of LLS assays and evaluate whether the S422E modification modulates the types of aggregates formed by hT40 (<Fig. 2A-E>). Total aggregate mass (<Fig. 2C>; t4=1.73, p=0.16) and mean aggregate length (<Fig. 2D>; t4=0.82, p=0.46) were not significantly different between hT40 and S422E tau constructs. Aggregates were sorted by area into oligomers, short filaments and long filaments for comparisons between hT40 and S422E samples. Area measurements aligned well with previously defined criteria for oligomers using length (i.e., <50nm) (<Patterson et al., 2011a>)). Previously, filaments were defined as aggregates >50 nm in length (<Patterson et al., 2011a>), but here we further segregated filaments into short and long categories using area (short: 1000-5000 nm2 corresponding to ∼35-275 nm lengths and long: >5000nm2 corresponding to ∼200-1800 nm lengths) to better characterize these two populations of filaments (<Fig. S1, Table S1>). For both tau constructs, there were significantly more oligomer-type aggregates than short or long filaments formed, but no significant difference between the numbers of short or long filament (<Fig. 2H>; F(2,12)=86.64, p<0.0001). S422E did not differ significantly from hT40 in the number of oligomers, short filaments, or long filaments formed (F(1,12)=0.05, p=0.83). We used a sandwich ELISA to determine whether monomer and aggregated hT40 and S422E tau differ in the extent of PAD exposure and oligomer formation (<Fig. 3>). Total tau was assessed using Tau5 sandwich ELISAs, and as expected the monomer and aggregate samples were equivalent between all groups (<Fig. 3A>; hT40 vs. S422E, F(1,12)=3.09, p=0.10; monomer vs. aggregate, F(1,12) =1.80, p=0.20). Compared to monomers, aggregation significantly increased PAD exposure for both hT40 and S422E samples (<Fig. 3B>; F(1,12)=685.8, p<0.0001), as indicated by increased TNT1 reactivity. Aggregation also significantly increased oligomer formation (TOC1 reactivity) compared to monomers in both hT40 and S422E samples (<Fig. 3C>; F(1,12)=109.3, p<0.0001). However, there were no differences in either TNT1 (F(1,12)=0.17, p=0.69) or TOC1 (F(1,12)=0.02, p=0.89) immunoreactivity between hT40 and S422E monomers or aggregates. The robust differences between monomers and aggregates, but lack of difference between hT40 and S422E constructs, were consistent across a range of sample concentrations (1.56-200 nM; data not shown). Next, we sought to investigate whether pseudophosphorylation at S422 altered the formation of SDS-stable tau dimers following aggregation in vitro (<Patterson et al., 2011a>). Immunoblotting with the high affinity total tau antibody, Tau13, detected tau monomers (∼64 kDa) and apparent 180 kDa tau dimers ((<Patterson et al., 2011a>); <Fig. 4A>). The 64 kDa molecular weight band was observed in hT40 and S422E monomer and aggregated samples as expected, and signal intensity was not significantly different between either tau construct (hT40 vs. S422E, F(1,12)=0.03, p=0.86) or tau species (monomer vs. aggregate, F(1,12)=0.02, p=0.88) (<Fig. 4B>). In contrast, aggregation of either hT40 or S422E significantly increased the amount of SDS-stable dimers at 180 kDa (<Fig. 4C>; F(1,12)=110.0; p<0.0001), as compared to the levels of these species in the respective monomer samples. Furthermore, S422E aggregation significantly increased the amount of SDS-stable dimers compared to hT40 aggregation (p=0.03)."
PMC4992631_4,"Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm were used to evaluate whether S422 pseudophosphorylation modulates the toxic effect of tau aggregates on FAT (<Brady et al , 1993>; <Morfini et al., 2007>). Vesicle motility was monitored for 50 min following perfusion of 2μM hT40 monomer (<Fig. 5A>), hT40 aggregates (<Fig. 5B>), S422E monomer (<Fig. 5C>), or S422E aggregates (<Fig. 5D>). Differences between groups were compared using average FAT rate (μm/sec) over the last 20 min of the assay (<Fig. 6A,B>). As previously reported, perfusion of hT40 monomer had no effect on the rate of anterograde FAT in the squid axoplasm (<Fig. 5A>), whereas perfusion of hT40 aggregates significantly inhibited anterograde FAT as compared to hT40 monomer (<Fig. 5B>; <Fig. 6A>; p=0.003) (<LaPointe et al., 2009b>). Neither hT40 monomers nor hT40 aggregates altered the rate of retrograde FAT (<Fig. 5A,B>; <Fig. 6B>). In contrast to hT40 monomer, perfusion of S422E monomer selectively inhibited anterograde transport (<Fig. 5C>; <Fig. 6A>; p=0.028), but not retrograde FAT. Surprisingly, aggregated S422E significantly inhibited both anterograde and retrograde FAT rates (<Fig. 5D>; <Fig. 6A,B>) compared to S422E monomer (anterograde, p=0.012; retrograde, p=0.002) and hT40 aggregates (retrograde only, p=0.019).We also performed a linear regression analysis of FAT rates over the 50 min assay and compared the slope of fitted lines to evaluate whether the rate of change in transport velocity was different among the treatment groups (all average slopes were negative; <Fig. 6C,D>). The slope of hT40 aggregates (m=-0.008) and S422E aggregates (m=-0.011) were significantly different from their respective monomer samples (<Fig. 6A>; hT40 monomer, m=-0.002, r2=0.17, p=0.003; S422E monomer, m=-0.005, r2=0.20, p=0.001), but hT40 and S422E aggregates were not significantly different when compared (p=0.243). The slopes for anterograde FAT in the S422E and hT40 monomer samples were statistically similar (<Fig. 6C>; p=0.243). The slope for retrograde transport in S422E aggregate-treated axoplasms (m=-0.008) was significantly different from S422E monomer-treated samples (<Fig. 6D>; m=-0.002, r2=0.12, p=0.015), while the slope for retrograde hT40 monomer and aggregates were not different (p=0.289). The slopes for retrograde transport in the hT40 aggregate (m=-0.004) and S422E aggregate groups (<Fig. 6D>; p=0.176) were not statistically distinguished from each other. Triple-label IF confocal microscopy (<Fig. 7A-D>) and sandwich ELISAs (<Fig. 7E-G>) were used to evaluate colocalization of pS422 with TOC1 and TNT1 in post-mortem AD brains. Staining in fixed tissue sections confirmed several previous reports (<Kanaan et al., 2016>; <Mufson et al., 2014>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>) that pS422 (<Fig. 7A>) extensively colocalizes with TNT1 (<Fig. 7B>) and TOC1 (<Fig. 7C>) in both control and AD brains, despite the relatively sparse appearance of tau pathology in the temporal cortices of control cases (data not shown). Sandwich ELISAs were developed to examine the co-occurrence of pS422 with either TNT1 or TOC1 in the same tau species isolated from the soluble fraction of control and AD frontal cortices. The amount of total tau captured with pS422 (detected with the pan-tau antibody, Tau5) was significantly higher in AD compared to control (<Fig. 7E>; t10=6.07, p=0.0001). The level of pS422 tau that also contained PAD exposed tau (i.e., TNT1 reactive) was significantly higher in AD compared to control (<Fig. 7F>; t10=2.31, p=0.0435). Similarly, the level of pS422 tau that also contained an oligomeric conformation (i.e., TOC1 reactive) was significantly higher in AD compared to control (<Fig. 7G>; t10=1.51, p=0.0029). Phosphorylation of tau protein at residue S422 is a disease-related modification (<Bussière et al., 1999>; <Hasegawa et al., 1996>) that occurs very early in AD, prior to NFT formation (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Kimura et al., 1996>). Despite an appreciation for the presence of pS422 in disease, a mechanistic link between pS422 and neuronal dysfunction, or degeneration, was not yet established. Previously, we demonstrated that appearance of the pS422 epitope is concomitant with early markers of tau toxicity, including oligomer formation (<Mufson et al., 2014>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>) and exposure of the N-terminal PAD (<Kanaan et al., 2016>). Here, we extended these previous immunohistochemical reports by demonstrating colocalization of pS422 with both TOC1 and TNT1 in situ and in tau species isolated from human brain tissue. Additionally, we have characterized the aggregation kinetics of S422E tau, and demonstrated that this modification stabilizes the formation of multimeric tau species. Further, S422E tau aggregates inhibited both anterograde and retrograde FAT in squid axoplasms. Collectively, these findings identify potential mechanisms by which phosphorylation of tau at S422 may contribute to toxicity in AD. Purified recombinant tau protein does not detectably aggregate over days of incubation under physiological conditions (<King et al., 1999>). However, aggregation can be accelerated in vitro by incubation with an anionic inducer, such as ARA (<Chirita et al., 2003>; <Wilson and Binder, 1997>). When induced, tau polymerization typically follows nucleation-dependent kinetics, characterized by a nucleation phase (i.e., lag time), followed by a more extended phase of exponential growth, before reaching a steady-state equilibrium (<Chirita and Kuret, 2004>). Nucleation follows a ligand-mediated mechanism, whereby inducer interaction stabilizes an altered conformation of tau that then undergoes self-aggregation (<King et al., 1999>; <Necula and Kuret, 2004b>). Results from the present analysis demonstrated that pseudophosphorylation of S422 increased the lag time of tau polymerization without altering the rate of elongation or maximum polymerization signal. Additionally, aggregates formed by S422E tau and hT40 tau had similar morphology, and showed comparable levels of β-sheet structures (i.e., ThS signal). Collectively, these observations suggest that S422E may prolong aggregate nucleation, but once elongation is initiated the aggregation reaction proceeds similarly to wild-type tau protein.Previously, pseudophosphorylation in the C-terminal domain of tau, including S422E and S409E, was found to have little effect on tau polymerization (<Necula and Kuret, 2004a>). For example, aggregated S422E or S409E accumulated a similar amount of filamentous tau relative to full-length wild-type tau, whereas mutations clustered near the proline-rich domain, (i.e., S212E/S214E, S199E/S202E/T205E) enhanced filament mass by 2-3-fold (<Necula and Kuret, 2004a>). Our results are consistent with these observations, and support the hypothesis that modifications in various locations along the polypeptide chain differentially affect tau aggregation (<Necula and Kuret, 2005>; <2004a>). The observed increase in lag time could indicate that pseudophosphorylation at S422 impedes the ability of ARA to interact with tau (<King et al., 1999>), or decreases the ability of tau to adopt a specific filament assembly-competent conformation (<Necula and Kuret, 2004b>). The stabilization of dimers further supports the notion that S422 modification has an impact on the structures formed during tau aggregation in vitro, but ultimately the final aggregated sample is comparable to wild-type tau by several measures. Since pS422 is known to colocalize with pretangle pathology (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Kimura et al., 1996>; <Mufson et al., 2014>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>), these in vitro results suggest this modification may contribute more to the stabilization of pre-fibrillar conformations rather than directly facilitating filament elongation. Accumulating evidence suggests that multimeric species of tau that precede NFTs are responsible for neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. For instance, reducing tau overexpression in the rTg4510 transgenic mouse decreases neuronal cell loss even though filamentous inclusions continue to form (<Santacruz et al."
PMC4992631_5,", 2005>), and multimeric tau species correlate with spatial memory deficits (<Berger et al , 2007>). Similarly, in human brain tissue, levels of granular tau oligomers are elevated, even in Braak stage I-II control cases (<Maeda et al., 2007>; <2006>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>) with limited NFT pathology (<H. Braak and E. Braak, 1997>).In the present study, aggregation of hT40 or S422E produced detectable SDS-stable tau multimers migrating as a major band with an apparent molecular weight of 180 kDa. The 180 kDa band has been previously identified as a tau dimer by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry (<Patterson et al., 2011a>; <Sahara et al., 2007>). S422E enhanced formation of the 180 kDa dimer as compared to hT40 suggesting that phosphorylation at this residue stabilizes a dimeric tau conformation. These dimers also corresponds to the SDS-stable species (∼140 and 170 kDa) described in the rTg4510 transgenic mouse, although the sizes are slightly different since our recombinant tau construct contains a histidine tag (<Berger et al., 2007>; <Sahara et al., 2013>; <2007>). <Berger et al., (2007)> demonstrated that these dimeric forms of tau are abnormally phosphorylated, including phosphorylation at S422, and they were negatively correlated with spatial memory performance in the Morris water maze. Despite S422E-mediated stabilization of tau multimer formation, TOC1 reactivity was not increased in comparison to hT40. One possible explanation for this is that TOC1 appears to label only a subpopulation of oligomeric aggregates (<Patterson et al., 2011a>). Hence, more than one tau oligomer conformation is likely to exist, and S422E may stabilize one or more multimer conformations not detected by the TOC1 antibody. The lack of differences in levels of PAD exposure between hT40 and S422E aggregate samples is consistent with the formation of similar levels and morphologies of tau polymers by the end of the in vitro polymerization assay. Taken together, these results indicate that S422 phosphorylation facilitates the formation of SDS-stable tau dimers. Co-localization between pS422, TNT1 and TOC1 was extensive in the temporal cortex of AD brains, consistent with previous reports (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Kanaan et al., 2016>; <Mufson et al., 2014>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>). The sandwich ELISAs captured pS422-reactive tau species and then used TNT1 and TOC1 to detect whether the pool of pS422 tau also contained PAD exposed and oligomer tau species, respectively. These are the first data to confirm that these modifications coexist on the same tau species. Interestingly, low total levels of tau with pS422 were captured from age-matched control brains in the ELISAs, and the data suggest that the majority of the pS422 tau in controls (∼0.1ng/ul) is reactive with TNT1 and TOC1, further supporting a close association between these modifications even in control brains. Together, these data confirm that pS422 tau species also exhibit increased PAD exposure and oligomerization in AD, all of which are linked to tau-mediated transport toxicity (<Kanaan et al., 2016>; <2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>; <Mufson et al., 2014>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>; <2011b>; <Vana et al., 2011>). Abnormalities in kinase activity and deficits in FAT, a cellular process critical for the maintenance of appropriate neural connectivity, are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and tauopathies (<Morfini et al., 2002a>; <2009a>). Dystrophic neurites, synaptic loss, and mislocalization of proteins are early pathogenic AD features consistent with this hypothesis (<Bell and Claudio Cuello, 2006>; <Dessi et al., 1997>; <Scheff et al., 1990>), but relationships among these critical pathogenic events remained unclear. Recently, our group described a mechanism by which physiological levels of aggregated tau inhibits kinesin-dependent anterograde FAT (<Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>). This effect is mediated by N-terminal amino acids 2-18 (<Kanaan et al., 2011>), comprising the PAD. Increased PAD exposure activates a protein phosphatase-1/glycogen kinase-3 (PP1/GSK3) signaling cascade that, in turn, promotes phosphorylation of conventional kinesin and detachment from its transported cargoes (<Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>). Collectively, these findings provided a mechanistic basis linking abnormal kinase activation, aberrant tau phosphorylation, and neuritic atrophy in AD (<Kanaan et al., 2013>; <Morfini et al., 2002a>).Our results indicate that both monomeric and aggregated S422E inhibit anterograde FAT in the squid axoplasm model. These findings are consistent with other disease-related forms of tau where increased PAD exposure was predicted in monomers. For example, mimicking the phosphoepitope of AT8 (i.e., S199E/S202E/T205E) impairs folding of the amino terminus in the paperclip conformation (<Deters et al., 2009>; <Gotz et al., 2001>; <Grueninger et al., 2010>; <Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986a>; <1986c>; <Jeganathan et al., 2006>; <Kosik et al., 1986>; <Wood et al., 1986b>) and this protein inhibited anterograde FAT as a monomer (<Kanaan et al., 2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>; <Spillantini and Goedert, 1998>). Moreover, a mutant form of tau associated with inherited frontotemporal dementia that lacks exons 6-9 (including the proline-rich region) also inhibited anterograde FAT as a monomer. This protein is unlikely to form the paperclip conformation because the hinge region is eliminated, ultimately increasing PAD exposure. The effects of S422E aggregates and monomers on anterograde FAT are likely due to the PAD-dependent activation of PP1/GSK3 pathway previously identified (<Bierer et al., 1995>; <Biernat et al., 1993>; <Drewes et al., 1995>; <Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>), but future studies are necessary to directly confirm this conclusion.Unexpectedly, we observed a toxic effect of S422E aggregates on retrograde FAT, a unique effect among all tau constructs tested to date in the isolated squid axoplasm preparation (<Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009b>; <Morfini et al., 2007>; <Morishima-Kawashima et al., 1995>; <Patterson et al., 2011b>). Based on results from biochemical analyses here, S422E-mediated inhibition of retrograde FAT may result from activation of kinases other than GSK3, which selectively inhibits only anterograde FAT (<Berger et al., 2007>; <Kopeikina et al., 2011>; <Maeda et al., 2007>; <Matsuo et al., 1994>; <Morfini et al., 2002b>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>; <Sahara et al., 2013>). Accordingly, several phosphotransferases inhibit both anterograde and retrograde FAT through multiple mechanisms in the axoplasm preparation (<Kanaan et al., 2013>; <Kimura et al., 1996>; <Morfini et al., 2006>; <2009b>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>; <Pigino et al., 2009>; <Stoothoff and Johnson, 2005>; <Ward et al., 2013>). Given these precedents, it is conceivable that one or more of the phosphotransferases responsible for phosphorylation of S422 in situ (i.e., JNK and p38) (<Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Kimura et al., 1996>; <Mufson et al., 2014>; <Reynolds et al., 1997a>; <1997b>; <Vana et al., 2011>; <Yoshida et al., 2004>) could indirectly promote FAT deficits, but the precise mechanism of this effect remains to be identified.The squid axoplasm model system used here provides an opportunity to study axon-autonomous effects because the axoplasm is isolated from the somatodendritic compartment and synapses. In addition to the mechanism described above, various kinase-independent mechanisms have been proposed to inhibit FAT that could be alternate explanations for S422E effects. Because phosphorylation at S422 is unlikely to negatively affect microtubule affinity, monomers of this modified form of tau would be in position to impair axonal transport through more direct interactions with motor proteins on microtubules."
PMC4992631_6,"Some studies have proposed that tau can regulate motor protein binding to microtubules or physically block motor proteins (<Mandelkow, 2003>), but our previous studies found that application of normal tau monomers up to approximately 20-fold higher than physiological levels does not negatively affect transport in either direction in the squid axoplasm assay used here (<Morfini et al , 2007>). Moreover, aggregates of S422E, which would not be expected to bind microtubules, are more potent in affecting FAT. Another proposed mechanism involves alterations of transcription or translation but these are also unlikely to contribute to these effects because the axoplasm model is isolated from the somatodendritic compartment and synapses.In addition to its effects on FAT, these studies do not rule out the possibility that pS422 tau could exert toxicity through alternate pathways. Other proposed mechanisms for neurotoxicity include enhanced formation of degradation-resistant multimers that could overwhelm protein degradation machinery (<Myeku et al., 2015>; <Tai et al., 2012>; <Wang et al., 2009>) and/or compromise chaperone activity (<Patterson et al., 2011a>), impairment of neurophysiological functions (<Fá et al., 2016>), or promotion of mitochondria dysfunction (<Kopeikina et al., 2011>). However, the relatively low concentrations of S422E tau and the short incubation time used presently would argue against these mechanisms as an explanation for the effects on FAT. Finally, PAD-dependent effects on synaptic function (<Moreno et al., 2016>) could be enhanced by pS422. Additional studies are required to establish whether S422E tau plays a role in one or more of these alternative pathways of toxicity. In summary, the present work using S422E tau identifies three potential effects of pS422-modified tau relevant to AD. First, S422E slows the nucleation phase of tau aggregation. Delayed filament formation may stabilize pre-fibrillar tau conformations that contribute to toxicity. Second, S422E facilitates the formation of stable tau dimers. Whether these two mechanisms are related is currently unknown; however the observation that phosphorylation at a single residue can stabilize tau multimer conformations known to contribute to disease (<Berger et al., 2007>; <Bussière et al., 1999>; <Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2006>; <Hasegawa et al., 1996>; <Jeganathan et al., 2008>; <Kanaan et al., 2012>; <2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009a>; <Necula and Kuret, 2005>) is novel. Finally, we identify a unique effect of aggregated S422-phosphorylated tau on FAT. Not only is S422E tau capable of inhibiting anterograde FAT as a monomer and aggregate, but it also is capable of inhibiting retrograde FAT when aggregated. Interestingly, the mechanism of this retrograde inhibition remains to be identified and is likely PAD-independent, as S422E does not appear to expose PAD to a greater extent than wild-type tau. In combination with our data from human AD brains, these results reveal a novel mechanistic link between tau phosphorylation at S422 and toxicity in AD. rhetorical Figure 1 Polymerization kinetics of hT40 (open circles; n=4) and S422E (closed triangles; n=4) during the entire 360 min reaction (A).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau undergoes numerous modifications, including increased phosphorylation at serine-422 (pS422). In the human brain, pS422 tau protein is found in prodromal AD, correlates well with cognitive decline and neuropil thread pathology, and appears associated with increased oligomer formation and exposure of the N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). However, whether S422E phosphorylation contributes to toxic mechanisms associated with disease-related forms of tau remains unknown. Here, we report that S422-pseudophosphorylated tau (S422E) lengthens the nucleation phase of aggregation without altering the extent of aggregation or the types of aggregates formed. When compared to unmodified tau aggregates, the S422E modification significantly increased the amount of SDS-stable tau dimers, despite similar levels of immunoreactivity with an oligomer-selective antibody (TOC1) and another antibody that reports PAD exposure (TNT1). Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm further revealed that S422E tau monomers inhibited anterograde, kinesin-1 dependent fast axonal transport (FAT). Unexpectedly, and unlike unmodified tau aggregates, which selectively inhibit anterograde FAT, aggregates composed of S422E tau were found to inhibit both anterograde and retrograde FAT. Highlighting the relevance of these findings to human disease, pS422 tau was found to colocalize with tau oligomers and with a fraction of tau showing increased PAD exposure in the human AD brain. This study identifies novel effects of pS422 on tau biochemical properties, including prolonged nucleation and enhanced dimer formation, which correlate with a distinct inhibitory effect on FAT. Taken together, these findings identify a novel mechanistic basis by which pS422 confers upon tau a toxic effect that may directly contribute to axonal dysfunction in AD and other tauopathies. ."
PMC3538024_0,"Previous studies suggest that levels of the astrocyte-derived S100B protein, such as those occurring in brain extra-cellular spaces consequent to persistent astroglial activation, may have a pathogenetic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although S100B was reported to promote β amyloid precursor protein overexpression, no clear mechanistic relationship between S100B and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is established. This in vitro study has been aimed at investigating whether S100B is able to disrupt Wnt pathway and lead to tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Utilizing Western blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, supershift and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques, it has been demonstrated that micromolar S100B concentrations stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation through the receptor for advanced glycation ending products, and subsequently activate nuclear AP-1/cJun transcription, in cultured human neural stem cells. In addition, as revealed by Western blot, small interfering RNA and immunofluorescence analysis, S100B-induced JNK activation increased expression of Dickopff-1 that, in turn, promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylation and β-catenin degradation, causing canonical Wnt pathway disruption and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. These findings propose a previously unrecognized link between S100B and tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting S100B can contribute to NFT formation in AD and in all other conditions in which neuroinflammation may have a crucial role.

Volney Sheen is supported by grants from the Julian and Carol Cohen, and is a Beckman Young Investigator and Doris Duke Clinical Scientist Development Award recipient. A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the neu-rofibrillary tangles (NFTs) seen in the pathologic brain [<1>]. NFTs are comprised of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau microtubule associated protein, indicating that a dysregulation of tau phosphorylation may be responsible for the abnormal aggregation and the impaired function of this protein in the AD brain [<2, 3>]. Several studies suggest that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which phosphorylates serine/threonine and regulates the Wnt signalling pathway, likely contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation. Unlike most protein kinases, GSK-3β is normally constitutively active in all cells, and is primarily regulated through inhibition [<4>]. In general, GSK-3β phosphorylation is inhibited through the canonical Wnt signalling pathway [<5>]. Wnt, binding to frizzled receptor, recruits dishevelled protein, which in turn antagonizes GSK-3β activity. GSK-3β regulates tau by phosphorylation as well as regulates splice variance. Hyperphosphorylated tau has less affinity toward the microtubules, and readily aggregates into paired helical filaments (PHFs) and NFTs, disrupting microtubule stability. This leads to alterations in the synaptic plasticity and causes neurodegenerative changes [<6>]. However, also hyperphosphorylated tau itself appears to be neurotoxic and able per se to promote the neuronal injury and the cell death observed in AD brain [<7>].Aberrant processing of β amyloid peptide (Aβ), which is thought to contribute to the development of AD, disrupts the Wnt signalling cascade, induces GSK-3β activation, stimulates tau hyperphosphorylation and provokes neuronal cell damage [<8>].Aβ not only exhibits direct cytotoxic mechanisms that impact on neuronal survival but also promotes inflammatory processes that contribute to the AD phenotype [<9>]. While the initial glial activation due to Aβ beneficially contributes to the restoration of brain function, on the contrary a persistent reactive gliosis may result in maladaptative detrimental responses, thus substantially contributing to AD progression. For example, ongoing inflammation can trigger various cell stress-response pathways, including overexpression of the secreted glycoprotein Dickopff-1 (DKK-1). DKK-1 up-regulates GSK-3β activity, promotes tau hyper-phosphorylation, NFT formation and neuronal degeneration. Thus, DKK-1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a manner similar to Aβ, and thereby fosters a self-sustaining feedback loop resulting in cellular injury [<8, 10, 11>].In this scenario S100B, a small soluble protein belonging to the large family of EF-related (EF helices) Ca++ and Zn++-binding proteins, primarily secreted by astrocytes [for review see <12>], may contribute to the AD brain phenotype. While at nanomolar concentrations S100B provides a pro-survival effect on neurons and stimulates the neurite outgrowth, at higher micromolar concentrations the protein promotes neuroinflammatory processes and neuronal apoptosis [<13>]. S100B has been reported overexpressed in AD brain, especially where the neuritic plaques are concentrated. S100B, S100B mRNA and its specific activity were higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls, and the excess of S100B was localized to activated astrocytes surrounding the neuritic plaques. This suggests that elevate levels of S100B are closely associated with reactive gliosis and AD neuropathology [<14>], and this notion is substantiated by findings showing that S100B can directly increase the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner [<15>]. Lastly, detrimental effects of S100B are transduced by interactions with receptor for advanced glycation ending products (RAGE) [<16>], which in microglial cells has been reported to lead to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation [<17>]. Perturbations in the JNK sig-nalling cascade can regulate DKK-1 expression [<18>].To date, no studies have investigated whether S100B is able to disrupt Wnt signalling and promotes tau protein hyperphosphorylation. The present study, using neural stem cells (NSCs), has been performed to explore this hypothesis. The findings propose a previously unrecognized link between S100B and tau hyperphosphorylation. Finally they reveal the biochemical mechanisms implicated in this effect and provide evidence that S100B contributes to NFT formation in AD. Derivation of foetal NSCs has previously been described [<19>]. NSCs were cultured in DMEM, 30% Ham's F-12, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 2% B27 (all from Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 20 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 1 week. NSCs were maintained at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml of medium, half of the medium being replaced with fresh medium every 3 days. For differentiation, cells were resuspended in plating media (DMEM/F-12, 2% B27), treated with 10-μM retinoic acid [<20>] (Sigma) and allowed to differentiate in plating media for 7–10 days. During differentiation, half of the plating medium was replaced every 2 days with fresh medium. After a brief incubation for 2–4 hrs in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), cells were supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 2% B27 and 1% foetal bovine serum (FBS) for adhesion and treatments. SHSY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum (FCS), 15% horse serum (HS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2/95% air and differentiated into neurons with 10 μM retinoic acid. Depending upon the experimental procedure, cells were plated on Petri dishes or on cover slips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence analysis. After treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 180 ×g for 10 min. at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1.5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM DTT) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 1 min. at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined, and equivalent amounts (100 μg) of each sample underwent SDS-PAGE electrophoresis."
PMC3538024_1,"Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and immunoblot was carried out with the following antibodies: anti-JNK (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, La Jolla, CA, USA), anti-DKK-1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GSK-3β (1:250, Lab Vision, Fremont, CA, USA), anti-β-catenin (1:250, Lab Vision), anti-Tau (1:1000, Neomarker, Freemont, CA, USA)  The membranes were incubated with the proper secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase (1:1000; DAKO, Golstrup, Denmark) and the immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL chemiluminescence method (Amersham, Milan, Italy). Protein relative expression was quantified by densitometric scanning of the X-ray films with a GS 700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and a computer programme (Molecular Analyst, IBM, Milan, Italy). The mRNA level was determined using the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method (Invitrogen). Total mRNA was extracted from cells by use of an ultrapure TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL, Milan, Italy) as directed by the manufacturer. The concentration and purity of total mRNA were determined from the A260/A280 ratio using a UV spectrophotometer (DU 40, Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA). The primer sequences used for PCR amplification were: c-Jun sense 5′-AAC- CTTCTATGACGATGCCCTCA-3′ and antisense 5′-CCT-GCTCATCTGTCACGTTCTT-3′; GAPDH sense 5′-GAAG-GTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′ and antisense 5′-GAAGATGGT-GATGGGATTTC-3′; DKK-1 sense 5′-ACCAGACCATTGA-CAACTAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GTGTCTAGCACAACA-CAATC-3′.1 μg of total RNA from each specimen was subjected to RT-PCR, carried out using a SuperScript TM One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq Kit (Invitrogen) in a total reaction volume of 25 μl, containing 2x reaction mix, 25 μM sense primer, 25 μM antisense primer, RT-PCR platinum Taq mix, and autoclaved distilled water. Electrophoresis was performed on the amplification products using a 1% agarose gel and the bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The integrated density values of the bands representing amplified products were acquired and analysed by GS 700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and a computer programme (Molecular Analyst, IBM). Nuclear extracts, prepared from treated NSCs, were obtained according the technique described by De Stefano et al.[<21>]. Samples were incubated with 10000 cpm of the 32P-labelled AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) oligonucleotide (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The binding assay was performed in the presence of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biosystem, Milton Keynes, UK) as a nonspecific competitor and 32P-labelled AP-1 for 30 min. at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. In supershift and competition assays, 500 μl of AP-1 antibodies (anti-Fra-1, anti-c-Fos, anti-c-Jun and anti-Jun-D, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min. before the addition of the labelled probe. NSCs were plated onto glass slide chambers coated with poly-D-lysine (BD, Milan, Italy) for several hours and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cultures were placed in PBS blocking solution containing 10% FCS and 5% HS, and incubated with the following antibodies: anti-DKK-1 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MAP-2 (1:300, Lab Vision), anti-tau (1:200, Neomarker). Following PBS washing, sections were incubated in the dark for 30 min. with Texas Red conjugated or fluorescein isothio-cyanate conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, AbCam, Cambridge, UK). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Sigma). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was thus performed by using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning system and immunopositive cells quantified by a computer programme. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique for DKK-1 was carried out on SHSY5Y cells according to protocol indicated by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, see catalogue number sc-37082) and scrambled sequence for DKK-1 was used as a negative control. Specific silencing was confirmed by at least three independent immunoblot and RT-PCR experiments. Prior studies have shown that S100B interactions with RAGE in microglia are accompanied by increased oxidative stress signalling that is linked to the activation of different members of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) family, and subsequent induction of nuclear transcription factors [<17, 18>]. Initiation of this pathway is dependent upon exposure to micro-molar concentrations of exogenous S100B and interactions with the RAGE extracellular domain but is independent of RAGE transducing activity [<17, 22>]. To address whether a similar pathway might exist within a mixed human neuronal and glial cell population, we first investigated the effects of exogenous S100B challenge on phosphorylation of the stress-responsive JNK. Incubation of differentiated NSCs with increasing concentrations of purified S100B protein (0.05–5 μM) revealed a dose-dependent increase in JNK phosphorylation (pJNK) within 30 min. of S100B stimulation (<Fig. 1>). We then assessed the involvement of RAGE in mediating S100B activation of pJNK. S100B-treated cultures (maximal response obtained at 5 μM) were challenged with a specific RAGE blocking antibody at two dilutions (1:1000 or 1:10,000 v/v). The RAGE blocking antibody significantly reduced JNK phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (<Fig. 1>). These experiments suggest that S100B interaction with RAGE leads to the activation of the stress-response kinase JNK in mixed human neuronal and glial cell populations. rhetorical 1 S100B induces JNK phopsphorylation through RAGE interaction in a dose-dependent fashion. pJNK protein expression was evaluated in lysates of NSCs 30 min. following exposure at increasing concentrations of S100B (0.05–5 μM), by Western blot (upper panel) and densitometric analysis of corresponding bands (lower panel). Statistics show a significant dose-dependent effect of S100B on JNK phosphorilation.

We therefore tested whether S100B exposure (5 μM) resulted in AP-1 complex induction by EMSA."
PMC3538024_2,"S100B-induced AP-1 complex up-regulation peaked at 2 hrs after stimulus and progressively declined over 6 hrs after S100B exposure (<Fig  2A>). Based on these results, we fixed the S100B exposure at 2 hrs for the subsequent investigations. Further EMSA analysis revealed that specific RAGE blocking antibody was able to decrease AP-1 complex up-regulation in a concentration-dependent manner (1:1000 or 1:10,000 v/v) within S100B-induced versus untreated differentiated NSCs. Blocking using an unrelated control antibody was ineffective and the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabelled AP-1 oligonucleotide completely abolished AP-1 DNA complex formation, showing the specificity of action by the RAGE antibody and S100B (<Fig. 2B>). Supershift studies were also performed on S100B challenged cultures (5 μM) to identify activation of specific AP-1 complex components, using antibodies directed against c-Fos, c-Jun, Fra-1 and Jun-D. A supershift in the c-Fos and c-Jun complexes was appreciated at 2 hrs after S100B treatment, while no significant effect was detected in the other tested complexes (<Fig. 2C>). Finally, RT-PCR analysis of the c-Jun/JNK pathway demonstrated that c-Jun mRNA expression was induced 6 hrs following cell stimulation with increasing concentrations of S100B (0.05–5 μM) in a concentration-dependent fashion, when compared with unchallenged cells. The S100B induction of c-Jun was attenuated by RAGE blocking antibody, while unrelated blocking antibody had no effect (<Fig. 2D>). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the soluble, astroglial-derived S100B protein interacts with RAGE leading to the JNK phosphorylation and the pJNK-dependent up-regulation of c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 complex. rhetorical 2 S100B induces AP-1/DNA complex activation through RAGE interaction. (A) AP-1/DNA complex activation was detected in NSCs at various time point (30 min. to 6 hrs) following the exposure to 5 μM of S100B.

Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway leads to two main molecular mechanisms, represented by the inhibition of GSK-3β and the relative accumulation/degradation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm [<5, 8>]. Different stress-related stimuli such as DKK-1 can also disrupt the Wnt pathway, inhibiting GSK-3β suppression and inducing tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Given our prior observation of DKK-1 induction by S100B, we investigated whether the GSK-3β and β-catenin expression was altered 24 hrs following cell stimulation with S100B (0.05–5 μM) by immunoblot analysis. S100B caused a concentration-dependent increase in GSK-3β phosphorylation (as shown by increased immunoreactivity of p-Ser-9 bands, <Fig. 4A>), as well as a parallel degradation in β-catenin expression in treated versus untreated cells (<Fig. 4B>). Both of these effects on S100B (5 μM) challenged cells were reduced by RAGE blocking antibody (1:1000 or 1:10,000 v/v), suggesting that S100B functions as a disruptor of the canonical Wnt pathway through a RAGE-dependent interaction. rhetorical 4 S100B induces tau protein hyperphosphorylation through Wnt pathway disruption.

Two different dilutions of RAGE blocking antibody (1:1000 or 1:10,000) were able to concentration-dependently antagonize the effect of the highest concentration of S100B. (B) β-catenin protein expression was evaluated 24 hrs following treatment by Western blot (upper panel) and densitometric analysis of corresponding bands (lower panel). β-actin served as a loading control. Statistics show that S100B significantly and concentration-dependently affected β-catenin protein expression. Two different dilutions of RAGE blocking antibody (1:1000 or 1:10,000) were able to revert the effect of the highest concentration of S100B in a concentration-dependent manner. (C) pppTau protein expression was evaluated 48 hrs following treatment by Western blot (upper panel) and densitometric analysis of corresponding bands (lower panel). Tau served as a loading control. Statistics indicate that S100B was able to concentration-dependently and significantly promote pppTau protein expression. Two different dilutions of RAGE blocking antibody (1:1000 or 1:10,000) antagonized the effect of the highest concentration of S100B in a concentration-dependent fashion.

Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway leads to two main molecular mechanisms, represented by the inhibition of GSK-3β and the relative accumulation/degradation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm [<5, 8>]. Different stress-related stimuli such as DKK-1 can also disrupt the Wnt pathway, inhibiting GSK-3β suppression and inducing tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Given our prior observation of DKK-1 induction by S100B, we investigated whether the GSK-3β and β-catenin expression was altered 24 hrs following cell stimulation with S100B (0.05–5 μM) by immunoblot analysis. S100B caused a concentration-dependent increase in GSK-3β phosphorylation (as shown by increased immunoreactivity of p-Ser-9 bands, <Fig. 4A>), as well as a parallel degradation in β-catenin expression in treated versus untreated cells (<Fig. 4B>). Both of these effects on S100B (5 μM) challenged cells were reduced by RAGE blocking antibody (1:1000 or 1:10,000 v/v), suggesting that S100B functions as a disruptor of the canonical Wnt pathway through a RAGE-dependent interaction.Tau hyperphosphorylation is an expected consequence of Wnt pathway disruption. We therefore examined whether S100B treatment (0.05–5 μM) altered tau protein phosphorylation levels in the mixed neuronal and glial cultures. S100B exposure induced tau protein hyperphosphorylation at 48 hrs following stimulation in treated versus untreated cells, as shown by the immunoreactive pppTau bands (<Fig. 4C>). Similar to RAGE antibody inhibition of S100B-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation and β-catenin degradation, RAGE antibody (1:1000 or 1:10,000 v/v) blockade of interactions with S100B resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in tau protein hyperphosphorylation (<Fig. 4C>). The current experiments show that blocking S100B and RAGE interactions inhibits JNK phosphorylation, activation of the AP-1/cJUN complex, DKK-1 expression, components of the canonical Wnt pathway and tau microtubule associated protein phosphorylation in mixed human neuronal and glial cultures. Moreover, inhibitors of JNK phosphorylation block DKK-1 expression, and prior studies have shown that DKK-1 overex-pression promotes GSK-3β activity and tau hyperphosphorylation.

The current studies extend upon known mechanisms of neuronal injury in AD. While aberrant processing of Aβ in neurons intrinsically leads to disruption of the canonical Wnt pathway [<24>], NFT formation and neuronal cell death, these same processes can invoke an extrinsically mediated glial inflammatory response. Here we show that elevated levels of the astrocyte-released S100B protein can similarly disrupt the Wnt signalling pathway, through interactions with RAGE and up-regulation of the DKK-1 glycoprotein. The activation of this molecular cascade leads to GSK-3β activation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. The dysregulation of tau phosphorylation is thought to be responsible for NFT formation and neuronal death in the AD brain [<1, 25>]."
PMC3538024_6,"Several lines of evidence support a role for reactive gliosis in mediating AD progression  Senile plaques (SPs) and NFTs are co-localized with clusters of activated microglia and associated with a broad variety of astrocyte-derived inflammation-related proteins. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Aβ peptide fragments induce a prominent neuroinflammatory response, responsible for the synthesis of different cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide, prostaglandins, interleukins and specific glial-derived molecules such as S100B protein [<26, 27>]. Finally, reactive gliosis can induce oxidative stressors and Wnt disruption, and both factors result in amyloidogenesis and tauopathy [<28>].S100B expression is associated with the pathology seen in the aging AD brain [<29>]. Mice that exhibit premature aging express higher concentrations of S100B than can otherwise be explained by mice age alone. S100B protein is also increased both in post mortem AD brain and in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients in the early stages of the disease [<30>]. Similarly, elevated S100B levels correlate with the early onset AD seen in trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) [<31, 32>], while transgenic mice that overexpress APP also display increased numbers of activated astro-cytes and tissue concentrations of S100B, several months before the appearance of Aβ deposits and SP formation [<33>]. Finally, S100B is overexpressed in activated astrocytes surrounding SPs, where the degree of astrocyte response correlates with the degree of the neuritic pathology [<29, 34>].Several pathological mechanisms can be triggered from the overexpression of S100B. Elevated S100B levels exert damaging effects on neurons through pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory stress-related transcription factors [<35–38>].In addition, S100B can directly increase APP expression [<15>], which in turn can activate astrocytes and raise S100B levels, thereby fostering a self-sustaining feedback loop that drives the progressive pathology seen in AD. Finally, the current studies demonstrate that S100B can disrupt the Wnt pathway through increases in the glycoprotein DKK-1. DKK-1 promotes activation of GSK-3β, a key member of Wnt pathway implicated in tauopathy.A central role for DKK-1 in mediating Wnt disruption and neuronal degeneration in AD brain has previously been demonstrated [<8, 10, 11>]. In cortical neurons, APP induces the expression of the secreted DKK-1, which negatively modulates the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and thus activates the tauphosphorylating enzyme GSK-3β. DKK-1 is also expressed by degenerating neurons in AD brain, and co-localizes with NFTs and distrophic neurites. Results from this work now reveal that exposure to elevated levels of S100B protein (likely from reactive astrogliosis) can similarly disrupt Wnt signalling through DKK-1. In this manner, both neuronal (APP) and glial (S100B) factors may promote the same cellular mechanisms that are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.The current study emphasizes the key role of reactive gliosis in AD progression and reinforces the need to identify factors responsible for glial-maintained neuroinflammation. Glial inflammation leads to elevated expression of astrocyte-derived S100B. While S100B can promote APP expression and APP-dependent neuronal injury, we now show that this soluble protein can also disrupt Wnt signalling through DKK-1 and promote tau hyperphosphorylation. Tau hyperphosphorylation is associated with NFT formation and AD progression. These findings suggest that reagents that inhibit S100B function may serve a neuroprotective function and provide an effective strategy to delay the progression of AD. Previous studies suggest that levels of the astrocyte-derived S100B protein, such as those occurring in brain extra-cellular spaces consequent to persistent astroglial activation, may have a pathogenetic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although S100B was reported to promote β amyloid precursor protein overexpression, no clear mechanistic relationship between S100B and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is established. This in vitro study has been aimed at investigating whether S100B is able to disrupt Wnt pathway and lead to tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Utilizing Western blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, supershift and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques, it has been demonstrated that micromolar S100B concentrations stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation through the receptor for advanced glycation ending products, and subsequently activate nuclear AP-1/cJun transcription, in cultured human neural stem cells. In addition, as revealed by Western blot, small interfering RNA and immunofluorescence analysis, S100B-induced JNK activation increased expression of Dickopff-1 that, in turn, promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylation and β-catenin degradation, causing canonical Wnt pathway disruption and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. These findings propose a previously unrecognized link between S100B and tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting S100B can contribute to NFT formation in AD and in all other conditions in which neuroinflammation may have a crucial role. ."
PMC3120096_0,"The microtubule associated protein tau promotes neuronal survival through binding and stabilization of MTs. Phosphorylation regulates tau–microtubule interactions and hyperphosphorylation contributes to the aberrant formation of insoluble tau aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies<1>. However, other pathogenic post-translational tau modifications have not been well characterized. Here we demonstrate that tau acetylation inhibits tau function via impaired tau–microtubule interactions and promotes pathological tau aggregation. Mass spectrometry analysis identified specific lysine residues, including lysine 280 (K280) within the microtubule-binding motif as the major sites of tau acetylation. Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies of brains from tau transgenic mice and patients with AD and related tauopathies showed that acetylated tau pathology is specifically associated with insoluble, Thioflavin-positive tau aggregates. Thus, tau K280 acetylation in our studies was only detected in diseased tissue, suggesting it may have a role in pathological tau transformation. This study suggests that tau K280 acetylation is a potential target for drug discovery and biomarker development for AD and related tauopathies.

We thank Chi Li, Yan Xu, Terry Schuck and other members of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research for their technical support and helpful comments. This study was supported by AG17586 (V.M.Y.L.), AG010124 (J.Q.T.) and the Association for Frontotemporal Dementias (T.J.C.). Tau proteins are expressed primarily in the central nervous system where the critical functions of promoting micro-tubule (MT) assembly and stability are mediated by six tau isoforms generated by mRNA alternative splicing containing either three (3R-tau) or four (4R-tau) MT-binding repeats<2>,<3>. Regulation of tau binding to MTs is mediated by serine/threonine phosphorylation, which decreases tau–MT-binding affinity<4>–<6>. However, aberrant accumulation of unbound hyperphosphorylated insoluble tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease (AD; for review see refs <1>, <7>). Genetic studies demonstrated that missense mutations that alter tau binding and MT assembly (for example, ΔK280, V337M, P301L, R406W) are pathogenic for frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), which is characterized by prominent NFTs and neurodegeneration<8>–<11>.The mechanism leading normal soluble tau to become hyperphosphorylated and disengaged from MTs to form tau inclusions remains unknown and post-translational modifications other than phosphorylation could regulate tau function and aggregation. Notably, reversible lysine acetylation has emerged as a potential regulatory modification implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, and a recent study demonstrated that tau is modified by lysine acetylation<12>. However, the functional significance and implications of tau acetylation in neurodegenerative tauopathies are not clear.Thus, to determine whether tau acetylation is linked to tau aggregation and disease pathogenesis, we assessed tau acetylation in vitro, in cell-based models, in tau Tg mouse models, and in a wide spectrum of human tauopathies including AD. We provide evidence that tau acetylation at specific lysine residues impairs tau-mediated stabilization of MTs and enhances tau aggregation. Furthermore, tau acetylation is associated with insoluble, Thioflavin-positive NFTs in tau Tg mouse models and human tauopathies, implicating tau acetylation as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of neuro-degenerative tauopathies. To fully characterize tau acetylation, recombinant full-length tau (T40) or a fragment encompassing all four MT-binding repeats (K18), were incubated with [14C]-acetyl Co-A in the presence of the acetyltransferase Creb-binding protein (CBP)<13>. Although tau-K18 and tau-T40 displayed low-level auto-acetylation frequently seen with high-affinity substrates, CBP enhanced the acetylation of both full-length T40 and the K18 fragment, suggesting acetylated lysine residues lie within the MT-binding region (<Fig. 1a>). Tau-T40 was fibrillized in vitro to generate tau fibrils in which the MT-binding region forms the fibril core. These tau fibrils could not be acetylated indicating lysine residues are not accessible to acetylation in fibrillized tau. To confirm tau acetylation in vitro, immunoblotting using a pan-anti-acetyl-lysine antibody revealed that both T40 and K18 were acetylated in the presence of CBP (<Fig. 1b>). To assess the significance of tau acetylation, we determined the ability of acetylated tau-K18 (<Fig. 1c>) or full-length tau-T40 (<Supplementary Fig. S1>) proteins to promote MT assembly using a light-scattering technique<8>. As expected, native K18 promoted tubulin assembly into MTs as determined by absorbance at 350 nm. In contrast, acetylated K18 failed to promote MT assembly, similar to the negative control K18 containing the K311D mutation, previously shown to impair tau–MT interactions<14>,<15>.In addition to promoting MT assembly, the MT repeat domain is the core region required for tau fibrillization into AD paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments found in other tauopathies<16>,<17>. Given the robust tau acetylation within the MT-binding region, we determined whether acetylation of tau-K18 (<Fig. 1d>) or tau-T40 (<Supplementary Fig. S1>) affects tau fibrillization. Using a heparin-induced tau fibrillization assay quantified by Thioflavin-T (ThT) binding, native K18 did not fibrillize during the 4-h incubation period, whereas acetylated K18 fibrillized rapidly by 3 h indicating acetylation enhanced the K18 fibrillization rate (<Fig. 1d>). Similar enhancement of tau-T40 aggregation was also observed (<Supplementary Fig. S1>). Sedimentation analysis of acetylated K18 confirmed this finding and showed significant fibril accumulation in pellet fractions from 1 to 3 h, whereas native K18 was predominantly in the supernatant fraction (<Fig. 1e>). As expected, the negative control K18-K311D mutant did not fibrillize using both ThT and sedimentation assays. Confirming these observations, negative staining electron microscopy (EM) showed that acetylated K18 but not native K18 formed abundant filaments after 4 h (<Fig. 1f>). Thus, acetylation of tau proteins in vitro not only impaired the ability of tau to promote MT assembly but also enhanced tau fibrillization, similar to tau harbouring MT-binding region mutations in several FTDP-17 kindreds<18>,<19>.To characterize tau acetylation in cells, doxycycline-inducible HEK-293 cells stably expressing full-length tau-T40 (HEK-T40 cells) were labelled with [3H]-acetate followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS–PAGE and autoradiography (<Fig. 2a>). Although low-level tau acetylation was observed in untreated HEK-T40 cells, treatment with the pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but not the Sir2 class inhibitor nicotinamide<20>, resulted in a dramatic increase in acetylated tau levels. To further confirm tau acetylation, tau was immunoprecipitated from HEK-T40 cells transiently transfected with CBP, and acetylated tau was detected using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (<Fig. 2b>). CBP transfection alone promoted detectable tau acetylation, however, CBP expression in combination with TSA treatment led to a dramatic accumulation of acetylated tau. Notably, acetylated tau can be modified by HDAC activity as co-expression of CBP with wild-type (WT) HDAC6, but not a catalytically dead HDAC6 mutant, resulted in tau deacetylation (<Fig. 2c>). Thus, tau is dynamically regulated by reversible acetylation and deacetylation reactions. To identify acetylated lysine residues in tau, mass spectrometry analysis using nanoLC/nanospray/MS/MS was performed on recombinant T40 acetylated in vitro."

To validate in vitro acetylated sites, CBP-transfected HEK-T40 cells were treated with TSA and immunoprecipitated tau protein bands were excised for mass spectrometry analysis (<Supplementary Fig. S2> and <Supplementary Table S2>). Significant acetylation was detected on the double lysine K280/K281 within the peptide V–Q–I–I–N–K–K in the second MT-binding repeat as well as K163 and K369 within the proline-rich region and MT-binding region, respectively (see <Table 1>). Western analysis of lysine→arginine mutants demonstrated that mutation of all four lysine residues (tau-4KR) dramatically reduced tau acetylation in cells, indicating that K163/280/281/369 represent the major sites of tau acetylation (<Fig. 2d>).To evaluate the functional significance of tau acetylation, K→Q acetylation mimetic mutants were generated and expressed in HEK-293 cells. Consistent with previous reports<21>, WT tau overexpression stabilized MTs and promotes MT bundling, as detected by immunofluorescence (IF) using an anti-acetyl-tubulin antibody (<Fig. 2e–g>). However, expression of a tau-4KQ acetylation mimetic (K163/280/281/369Q), but not a tau-4KR non-mimetic mutant, showed a dramatic reduction in MT bundling activity (WT ~55% versus 4KQ ~7% versus 4KR ~50% bundling), consistent with loss of tau function induced by acetylation (<Fig. 2h–j>). Interestingly, MT bundling observed with the single K280Q mimetic was significantly reduced (~40% bundling), indicating acetylation of a single-lysine residue, that is, K280, is critical in regulating tau function (<Fig. 2k>). These results suggest that tau acetylation inhibits tau-mediated stabilization of MTs. Genetic studies have shown that deletion of K280 (ΔK280) is associated with FTDP-17 familial tauopathy<11>. Although the disease mechanism associated with ΔK280 is not fully understood, in vitro analysis of ΔK280 demonstrated impaired MT assembly<22> and enhanced PHF aggregation<19>,<23>. Thus, K280 acetylation functionally mimics ΔK280, potentially by inhibition of electrostatic tau–MT interactions. To monitor K280 acetylation in brain tissue, a polyclonal antibody was generated against an acetylated K280 tau peptide. Double affinity purification yielded a site-specific acetylated K280 antibody (hereafter referred to as anti-ac-K280) that detected acetylated WT tau, but not a ΔK280 mutant tau demonstrated by in vitro and cell-based acetylation assays (<Supplementary Fig. S3>). Ac-K280 positive cells were detected in the presence of active CBP, but not a catalytically inactive CBP mutant (CBP-LD). Moreover, expression of an HDAC6 small interfering RNA led to increased levels of ac-K280, further confirming the specificity of the anti-ac-K280 antibody and providing additional evidence that HDAC6 is a tau deacetylase (<Supplementary Fig. S3>).Using anti-ac-K280, we probed tau acetylation in mouse brain by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using two tau Tg mouse models that recapitulate tau pathology and NFT formation: PS19 monogenic mice expressing P301S mutant tau<24> and PS19;PDAPP bigenic mice, which additionally express the APP V717F mutant transgene that accelerates NFT formation and enhances tau amyloidogenesis<25>. Monogenic PS19 tau Tg mice revealed moderate neuronal ac-K280 immunoreactivity in both cortex and hippocampus when compared with non-Tg mice, although abundant hyperphosphorylated tau was detected by AT8, a phospho-tau specific antibody (<Fig. 3a–d>). However, bigenic PS19;PDAPP mice showed profound age-dependent increase in ac-K280 tau pathology (see <Supplementary Fig. S4>), particularly in the hippocampus, in which the intensity of ac-K280 staining was increased relative to monogenic PS19 mice (<Fig. 3e,f>). Moreover, significant co-localization of ac-K280 immunoreactivity was observed with AT8 in tau inclusions of PS19;PDAPP bigenic mice using double-labelling IF (<Fig. 3g–i>). Ac-K280-positive tau inclusions were also detected by Thioflavin-S (ThS), which demonstrates that tau amyloid lesions are prominently acetylated in these mice (<Fig. 3j–l>).To determine the biochemical properties of acetylated tau, sequential extraction of normal and pathological tau from WT, PS19 and PS19/PDAPP mouse cortices was conducted using buffers of increasing strength. RIPA and urea solubilized brain extracts from mouse cortices were analysed by western blotting using anti-ac-K280, PHF-1 and total tau (T14/T46) antibodies. RIPA extracted cortical lysates contained the majority of the soluble tau pool, indicated by total tau levels (<Fig. 3m>). In contrast, anti-ac-K280 reactivity was undetectable in RIPA-solubilized extracts, but instead accumulated in the insoluble urea fraction (<Fig. 3n>). Consistent with the IHC analysis, immunoblotting also revealed increased ac-K280 levels in PS19; PDAPP bigenic compared with PS19 mono-genic mice. Thus, tau acetylation is associated with biochemically insoluble, ThS-positive tau aggregates in tau Tg mouse models. To investigate tau K280 acetylation in human neuro-degenerative tauopathies, IHC was conducted on AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Pick’s disease (PiD) cases (see <Table 2> for human cases used in this study). These tauopathies share abundant filamentous tau pathology in affected brain regions, but differ in their patterns of insoluble tau isoforms with equal ratios of 3R/4R tau in AD, predominantly 4R-tau in CBD, and predominantly 3R-tau in PiD. Cortical brain sections of tauopathies were analysed using anti-ac-K280, which recognizes only 4R-tau isoforms as 3R-tau lacks K280 because of exon 10 alternative mRNA splicing. Remarkably, anti-ac-K280-positive NFTs and neuropil threads were prominently observed in AD cortex and resemble pathology detected by PHF-1 (<Fig. 4a–b>). CBD has extensive grey and white matter tau pathology of neuronal and glial tau inclusions, and anti-ac-K280 immunostained these tau pathologies similar to PHF-1 (<Fig. 4c–d>). Importantly, analysis of PiD inclusions containing primarily 3R-tau isoforms revealed no detectable anti-ac-K280 immunoreactivity (<Fig. 4e–f>), further validating anti-ac-K280 specificity. To determine whether acetylated tau is present within tau tangles, double IF microscopy revealed substantial co-localization of anti-ac-K280 and PHF-1 in all 4R-tau-specific tauopathies, including AD and CBD (<Fig. 4g–i and j–l>, respectively). Moreover, ThS-positive NFTs present in AD brains also co-localized with anti- ac-K280 immunoreactive tau inclusions (<Fig. 4m–o>). To determine the scope of acetylated tau lesions in human disease, we extended these observations to a wide spectrum of tauopathies with 4R-tau pathology (see case demographics in <Table 2>). Indeed, anti-ac-K280- positive tau aggregates were observed in all other tauopathies examined including progressive supranuclear palsy, argyrophilic grain disease, tangle predominant senile dementia and Guam parkinsonism–dementia complex (<Supplementary Fig. S5>). Thus, K280 acetylation is a feature found in a variety of human 4R or 3R/4R tauopathies including AD, but not 3R-tauopathies such as PiD.To demonstrate acetylated tau is present in PHFs of human tauopathies, we extracted PHFs from cortical regions of AD, CBD and PiD brains<5>,<8> and immunoblotted using anti-ac-K280, PHF-1 and T14/T46 (total tau) antibodies (<Fig. 4p>). Prominent PHF-tau isoforms were detected with PHF-1 and T14/T46 antibodies, confirming isolation of insoluble and hyperphosphorylated 4R/3R-tau (AD), 4R-tau (CBD) or 3R-tau (PiD) species. Consistent with the above IHC results, anti-ac-K280 detected 4R tau isoforms in AD and CBD cases, but not the 3R-tau isoforms in PiD. Furthermore, acetylation of normal soluble tau was never observed. These results are consistent with more prominent acetylation occurring specifically on pathologically insoluble, aggregated PHF-tau species."
PMC3120096_2,"This study demonstrates tau acetylation as a post-translational modification that may regulate normal tau function and suggests a role in pathological tau aggregation in AD and related tauopathies  Increased tau acetylation on K280 could impair tau interactions with MTs and provide increased pools of cytosolic tau available for pathological PHF aggregation. Consistent with this, K280, located in the inter-repeat region, was identified previously as one of three lysine residues most critical in modulating tau–MT interactions<22>. Moreover, K280 acetylation was not observed in tau fibrils assembled from recombinant T40 because this residue is buried within the fibril core. Thus, our data support the notion that K280 acetylation occurs before tau fibrillization into PHFs and therefore is likely a pathological event. Indeed, K280 acetylation was detected in all 4R- and 3R/4R-tauopathies that we examined, but was absent in 3R predominant PiD brains or soluble tau fractions of normal control samples.Acetylation of tau aggregates was associated with hyperphosphorylated, ThS-positive tau inclusions in both Tg mouse models and human tauopathies. This implies that negative regulation of tau function could occur via phosphorylation and acetylation events alone or in combination. Tau is extensively phosphorylated on at least 25 distinct serines/threonines residues, most of which are outside the MT-binding repeat region. In contrast, tau acetylation in cells was specifically detected on four lysines, three of which are located within the MT-binding repeats. Thus, tau acetylation and phosphorylation may represent specific modifications required to dynamically regulate tau function. One possibility is that increased tau phosphorylation could facilitate tau acetylation within the MT repeat domain to further impair tau binding to MTs, suggesting complex regulation of tau–MT dynamics. A more comprehensive analysis of acetylated and phosphorylated sites in diseased brains could provide insight into the potential cooperative regulation of tau post-translational modifications during disease pathogenesis.K280 resides in the double lysine motif, 275VQIINKK281, which is critical for MT binding. Indeed, this motif is conserved in other tau family members including MAP2 and MAP4, indicating reversible acetylation could represent a conserved mechanism to regulate the MT-binding activity of other MAPs in addition to tau. Although protein acetylation has been extensively studied in the context of histones and gene transcription, proteomics approaches have identified acetylated proteins in the cytoplasm and other organelles<26>. Several acetyl-transferases and deacetylases (HDACs) are localized to the cytoplasm and MTs<27>,<28>, suggesting acetylation may represent a general mechanism to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and coordinate cytoplasmic signalling events.Finally, our IHC and biochemical studies suggest that K280 acetylation may be more disease specific than phosphorylated tau in tauopathies. Thus, monitoring acetylated tau levels may represent a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of AD and related neurodegenerative tauopathies. Moreover, the identification of tau acetylation in tauopathies provides a framework for both biomarker development and for therapeutic targeting of tauopathies via the acetylation/deacetylation machinery. WT-CBP and CBP-LD inactive mutants as well as WT-HDAC6 and HDAC6-H803A enzyme-inactive mutant expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr Tso-Pang Yao (Duke University). The longest human tau isoform (designated Tau-T40) was cloned into pCDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen) and site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange kit; Stratagene) was used to create K→Q or K→R mutations at residues K163, K280, K281, K369 as indicated. Indicated plasmids were transfected into either QBI-293 cells or stably expressing HEK-T40 cells using Fugene (Roche). HEK-T40 cells were generated using 293 T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) transfected with pcDNA5/TO WT-T40 and selected with 200 μg ml− 1 of hygromycin and 5 μg ml− 1 blasticidin. Resistant clones were isolated from single cells and screened for tau expression by IF and immunoblotting. IF and MT bundling analysis of transiently transfected QBI-293 cells were performed as previously described<21>. HDAC6 siRNA (Invitrogen) sequence was as follows: 5′-AAAGUUGG AACUCUCACGGUGCAGC-3′ and was transfected using RNAi Max reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer protocols. Monoclonal antibodies used for western analysis were as follows: T46 (1:1000), T14 (1:1000), PHF-1 (1:1000) and AT-8 (1:500). Polyclonal antibodies used were as follows: ac-K280 (1:1000), anti-acetyl-lysine (1:1000, Cell Signaling), E10 (1:500), HDAC6 (1:1000, Santa Cruz). Tau K18 protein was either mock acetylated or acetylated in vitro using acetyl-CoA substrate as indicated in legend to <Figure 1>. Acetylation reaction samples were pooled together, concentrated to 1 ml using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (Millipore Corporation) and ten-fold diluted with 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) three times followed by concentration to 100 μl of concentrated tau protein. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Acetylated K18 and mock-treated K18 were assessed by a light-scattering assay as described in legend to <Figure 1c>. For fibrillization reactions, 10–20 μM K18 proteins were incubated at 37 °C with equal molar ratio of heparin in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The extent of fibrillization was assessed at different time points by ThT fluorescence assay, sedimentation analysis and negative staining EM as described in the legend to <Figure 1>. For ThT fluorescence assay, ThT diluted in 100 mM glycine buffer (pH 8.5) was added and fluorometric readings were taken at 450 nm (excitation) and 510 nm (emission). The assay was performed in triplicate. For sedimentation test, 40 μl fibrillization mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate fibrils soluble supernatant fractions. Pellets were washed once with 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in 40 μl of the same buffer. Equal volume of fractions were analysed by 15% SDS–PAGE gels followed by Coomassie staining. For negative staining EM, 6 μl of fibrillization mixture from each time point were placed on 300 meshed Formvar/carbon film-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 3 min, washed twice with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.6) for 5 min each, stained with 10–15 drops of 2% uranyl acetate and visualized with Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope (Jeol). Polyclonal anti-acetyl tau K280 antibodies were generated using the acetylated tau peptide C-QIINKKLDLSN containing K280 acetylation to immunize rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory). Double affinity purification was performed using native and acetylated peptides sequentially using Sulfolink columns (Pierce Biotechnology). Site specificity of ac-K280 was confirmed in vitro and in cells using tau proteins lacking residue K280 (<Supplementary Fig. S3>). Tissue preparation and IHC were performed on monogenic PS19 and bigenic PS19;PDAPP transgenic mice at 4, 8 and 11 months of age as described. Mice were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.0 in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Brains were surgically removed and fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin. Coronal slabs were fixed in neutral-buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 6 μm through the entire block. Tissues sections were stained using a Polymer horseradish peroxidase detection system (Biogenex) and automatically stained using the i6000 Automated Staining System (Biogenex). For human studies, fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were obtained from the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research Brain Bank at the University of Pennsylvania."
PMC3120096_3,"Consent for autopsy was obtained from legal representatives for all subjects in accordance with local institutional review board requirements  Briefly, fresh tissues from each brain were fixed with 70% ethanol in 150 mmol l− 1 NaCl, infiltrated with paraffin and cut into 6-μm serial sections. IHC was performed using the avidin– biotin complex detection system (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, antigen retrieval was done by incubating section in 88% formic acid, endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 5% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min and sections were blocked in 0.1 mol l− 1 Tris with 2% fetal bovine serum for 5 min. Primary antibodies were incubated for either 1 or 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used for IHC analysis: affinity purified rabbit anti-acetyl-tau (ac-K280; 1:250–1:2000), mouse anti-phospho-tau Ser202/Thr205 (AT8; 1:15,000), mouse anti-phospho-tau Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1; 1:1000). After washing, sections were sequentially incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1 h and avidin–biotin complex for 1 h. Bound antibody complexes were visualized by incubating sections in a solution containing 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.4 mM diaminobenzidine, 10 mM imidazole and 8.8 mM H2O2. Sections were then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and coverslipped. Double-labelling IF analyses were performed using Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), treated for autofluorescence with Sudan Black solution and coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Double-labelling ThS and IF was performed through sequential methods initially staining sections with ThS followed by IF. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and hydrated to dH2O, immersed in PBS pH7.3 for 5 min followed by immersion in 0.05% KMnO4/PBS for 20 min. Sections were rinsed in PBS and destained in 0.2% K2S2O5/O.2% oxalic acid/PBS and immersed in 0.0125% ThS/40% EtOH/60% PBS and differentiated in 50% EtOH/50%PBS for 10–15 min. After differentiation, sections were incubated with rabbit anti-ac-K280 overnight at 4 °C using standard IF techniques. Digital images were obtained using an Olympus BX 51 microscope (Olympus) equipped with bright-field and fluorescence light sources using a ProgRes C14 digital camera (Jenoptik AG) and Adobe Photoshop, version 9.0 (Adobe Systems) or digital camera DP71 (Olympus) and DP manager (Olympus). PHFs were isolated from normal and tauopathy brains as previously described<29>. Briefly, grey matter was homogenized in 3 vol per g of cold High Salt RAB buffer (0.75 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.02 M NaF, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.4). All buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, phosphatase inhibitor and HDAC inhibitors (2 μM TSA and 10 mM nicotinamide). Homogenates were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min to depolymerize MTs, then, centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were re-homogenized and centrifuged in 3 vol per g of cold High Salt RAB buffer. Resultant pellets were homogenized in 5 vol per g of cold PHF extraction buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 0.85 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. Sarkosyl was added to the supernatant (1% final concentration) and incubated at 4 °C overnight followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 g to generate crude PHF-tau fractions, which were solubilized by formic acid extraction. Fractionation of mouse cortices was performed by sequential extraction using buffers of increasing strength. Brain tissue was homogenized in 5 vol per g of low-salt buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min to generate low-salt fractions. Myelin floatation was performed on pellets re-extracted in low-salt buffer supplemented with 20% sucrose. Resulting pellets were re-extracted in 5 vol per g of RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1%NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%SDS). Finally, resultant insoluble pellets were extracted in 1 vol per g of tissue in urea buffer (7 M urea, 2 M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mM Tris, pH 8.5). Soluble and insoluble fractions were analysed by SDS–PAGE electrophoresis and western blotting using the indicated antibodies to detect total, acetylated or phosphorylated tau proteins. rhetorical Figure 1 (a) Recombinant full-length T40, 4R-tau MT-binding domain K18, or tau fibrils (see Methods for fibrillization assay) were acetylated by incubation with [14C]-labeled acetyl-CoA in the presence or absence of CBP.

(b) T40 or K18 proteins were incubated with acetyl-CoA and/or recombinant CBP and reaction products were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal anti-tau-specific antibody for MT repeat domain (E10) and an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. (c) MT assembly activities of K18 proteins were evaluated in light-scattering assays. Tubulin monomers (30 μM) were mixed with 40 μM tau proteins in MT assembly buffer supplemented with 2 mM guanosine triphosphate. MT assembly was determined by monitoring absorbance every minute at 350 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader. Colour key is as follows: native unmodified K18 (pink squares), acetylated K18 (blue triangles), K18 containing K311D mutation (turquoise X’s) and no tau control (black diamonds).

Colour key is as follows: native unmodified K18 (pink squares), acetylated K18 (blue diamonds) and K18-containing K311D mutation (turquoise triangles). Both MT assembly and fibrillization reactions were confirmed from n = 4 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean.

Samples were analysed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie staining to monitor fibril formation. (f) Four-hour time points from fibrillization reactions were analysed by negative-staining EM. Note, at the concentration of 10 μM, native K18 did not fibrillize, whereas acetylated K18 had fibrillized extensively with morphologies similar to AD-like PHFs.

The microtubule associated protein tau promotes neuronal survival through binding and stabilization of MTs. Phosphorylation regulates tau–microtubule interactions and hyperphosphorylation contributes to the aberrant formation of insoluble tau aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies<1>. However, other pathogenic post-translational tau modifications have not been well characterized. Here we demonstrate that tau acetylation inhibits tau function via impaired tau–microtubule interactions and promotes pathological tau aggregation. Mass spectrometry analysis identified specific lysine residues, including lysine 280 (K280) within the microtubule-binding motif as the major sites of tau acetylation. Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies of brains from tau transgenic mice and patients with AD and related tauopathies showed that acetylated tau pathology is specifically associated with insoluble, Thioflavin-positive tau aggregates. Thus, tau K280 acetylation in our studies was only detected in diseased tissue, suggesting it may have a role in pathological tau transformation. This study suggests that tau K280 acetylation is a potential target for drug discovery and biomarker development for AD and related tauopathies. ."
PMC4598295_0,"Tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases in which tau fibrils accumulate. Recent evidence supports soluble tau species as the major toxic species. How soluble tau accumulates and how it causes neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we identified tau acetylation at K174 as an early change in AD brains and as a critical determinant in tau homeostasis and toxicity in mice. An acetyl-mimicking mutant (K174Q) slows down tau turnover and induces cognitive deficits in vivo. The acetyltransferase p300-induced tau acetylation is inhibited by a prescription drug salsalate/salicylate, which enhances tau turnover and reduces tau levels. In the PS19 transgenic mouse model of FTD, administering salsalate after disease onset inhibited p300 activity, lowered ac-K174 and total tau levels, rescued tau-induced memory deficits and prevented hippocampal atrophy. The tau-lowering and protective effects of salsalate/salicylate are diminished in neurons expressing K174Q tau. Targeting tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic strategy against human tauopathies. We thank V. Haroutunian (The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) for human brain samples, B. Hann and J.

Neurodegenerative tauopathies include brain disorders such as primary tauopathies (e.g., Pick’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and secondary tauopathies (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD))<1>,<2>. Tauopathies are characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau fibrils. Although accumulation and distribution of NFTs have been used for diagnostic and staging purposes<3>, recent evidence supports a key pathogenic role of soluble tau oligomers<4>,<5>. Increased levels of tau oligomers were detected in the frontal cortex of AD patients at early Braak stages<4>,<6>. In rodents, injection of recombinant tau oligomers, but not fibrils, impaired memory in wild-type mice<7>. In tauopathy mouse models, levels of tau oligomers correlate with memory loss at various ages<8>. Moreover, suppressing soluble tau improves cognitive function without reducing levels of insoluble NFTs in inducible tauopathy mouse models<9>,<10>.Both autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways have been implicated in the tau clearance<11>,<12>. In AD brains, tau oligomers appear ubiquitinated and accumulate at synapses, where proteasome components are enriched<13>. Tau undergoes lysine acetylation<14>,<15>, which modulates diverse biological processes including protein stability and protein-protein interactions<16>. Analyses of the soluble fraction of AD brain lysates showed that tau acetylation was enhanced in patients at early/moderate Braak stages, consistent with an early role of acetylation in modulating tau accumulation<14>. Acetylation, but not phosphorylation<17>, regulates aggregation of recombinant tau in vitro<15>,<18>. Moreover, inhibiting the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) elevates tau acetylation, suppresses its polyubiquitination and slowed down its turnover in primary neurons<14>. However, it remains unclear which lysine residue(s) are aberrantly acetylated in AD brains, and whether they are key determinants in tau homeostasis in vivo.Here, we identified K174 acetylation as an early critical pathological change to soluble tau in AD brains, using mass spectroscopy and a newly developed antibody specific for ac-tau. We further established a critical role of K174 in tau homeostasis and toxicity. Lastly, we tested the effects of a prescription drug salsalate, which inhibits p300-induced tau acetylation, on tau-mediated behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration in PS19 mice, an FTD model. To identify acetylated lysines on soluble tau, we used mild detergents to extract lysates from AD brains. Tau was immunoprecipitated from soluble AD lysates, followed by proteolytic digestion and analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Lysine-174 on the native peptide IPA174KacTPPAPK was identified to be acetylated (<Fig. 1a>) and this was confirmed with a synthetic peptide of the same sequence (<Fig. 1b>). To further characterize ac-K174 in AD brains, we generated a polyclonal rabbit antibody, AC312, with an antigen containing acetylated K163 and K174 (ac-K163 was included based on previous in vitro studies<14>,<15>). Incubating recombinant human tau (hTau, 2N4R, 441 amino acids) with the acetyltransferase p300 led to strong AC312-positive signals, which were non-detectable without p300 (<Fig. 1c>). A pan-tau antibody (Ab707)<14> detected comparable levels of tau with or without p300, suggesting AC312 is specific for acetylated-tau (ac-tau). To determine the specificity of AC312 for different tau ac-K residues, human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transfected with WT or non-acetylatable mutant (KR) tau constructs with or without p300 co-expression. AC312 detected a strong p300-induced ac-tau signal in cells expressing WT tau or various KR mutants, except for K174R, indicating that AC312 is specific for ac-K174, although the peptide antigen contains ac-K163 (<Fig. 1d>).We next assessed K174 acetylation in AD brains at different Braak stages (<Supplementary Table 1>), a well-established staging method that correlates cortical tau pathology progression with the worsening of clinical symptoms<3>. Human brain lysates were partially purified on a column with Tau5 antibody to reduce non-specific signal. Immunoblots with the Tau5 antibody showed similar levels of tau in each sample (<Fig. 1e>). In contrast, AC312 immunoreactivity was very weak or non-detectable in brain lysates at Braak stage 0, but was distinctively stronger in lysates at early (stages 1–2) and later (3–5) Braak stages (<Fig. 1e,f>). PHF-1-positive phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) signal was more readily detected at later (3–5) Braak stages. These findings suggest ac-K174 is among the early pathogenic alterations of tau in AD.AC312 immunoreactivity was examined in PS19 mice, which express hTau with the P301S mutation under the mouse prion promoter, and develop cognitive and synaptic deficits that depend on hippocampal function<19>. The specificity of AC312 immunoreactivity was confirmed in non-transgenic and tau-knockout mice (<Supplementary Fig. 1a>). In 6-month-old PS19 mice when early pathological changes start to appear<19>, pathological tau was detected with MC1, an antibody specific for a pathogenic conformation of tau that precedes formation of tangles<20>,<21>. AC312 and MC1 immunoreactivity exhibited remarkable co-localization along the mossy fiber of hippocampus (<Fig. 1g–j>, <Supplementary Fig. 1b>). We previously showed that augmenting tau acetylation via SIRT1 inhibition slowed tau degradation in cultured neurons in vitro<14>. To determine if ac-K174 is critical to slow tau turnover, we replaced lysine with glutamine (K174Q), which neutralizes the positive charge and mimics the acetylated state. Conversely, a K174R mutant was used to mimic deacetylated-tau. Both mutations are commonly used to assess the effects of acetylation<22>–<24>."
PMC4598295_1,"To measure the hTau half-life, we infected rat primary neurons with lentiviral vectors expressing WT, K174Q, or K174R hTau, and quantified hTau levels in the presence of translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)  K174Q tau exhibited a longer half-life than K174R or WT tau (<Fig. 2a>). Since polyubiquitination on K174 should be blocked by both K174Q and K174R mutants, acetylation of K174 per se, not blockage of polyubiquitation alone, seems to slow tau degradation.We next determined the effects of ac-K174 on tau accumulation in vivo by injecting equal amount of adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1) vectors that express WT, K174Q, and K174R human tau (hTau) constructs into the hippocampus of 2–3 month old wildtype C57B6 mice. Tau overexpression is known to induce toxicity in hippocampus, which can be reliably targeted with AAV1 vectors. Direct comparisons were performed in two cohorts: K174Q vs WT and K174Q vs K174R. Immunostaining with an anti-hTau antibody, HT7, showed similar distributions of hTau throughout the hippocampus 10 days after injection (<Fig. 2b,d>). Similar levels of hTau transduction were maintained 3 months after injection, as determined by qRT-PCR (<Fig. 2c,e>). However, western blot analysis of hippocampal lysates revealed that monomeric K174Q tau levels were higher than those of WT tau (<Fig. 2f,g>-left) or K174R tau (<Fig. 2h,i>-left). Consistent with the effects of ac-tau on the half-life of tau in vitro, these results indicate that K174 acetylation per se, not the blockage of polyubiquitination alone, leads to monomeric tau accumulation in vivo. In addition, AAV-K174Q expression led to a marked increase in tau signal that migrates at ~140 kD, most likely dimeric tau (<Fig. 2f,g>-right; <Supplementary Fig. 2>). Interestingly, expressing K174R tau led to a similar increase of tau dimers as K174Q tau (<Fig. 2h, i>-right), supporting the importance of the K174 residue, but not acetylation per se, in tau aggregation. Indeed, recombinant K174Q and K174R tau showed a higher propensity for aggregation than WT tau in vitro, as indicated by the time-dependent increase of Thioflavin T–positive signals (<Fig. 2j>).Acetylation of the KXGS motif suppresses tau phosphorylation at KIG(S)(Ser262/Ser356)<18>. K174Q expression in hippocampus did not significantly affect the levels of ac-K(IGS) (<Supplementary Fig. 3>) or p-KIG(S)(Ser262/Ser356) (<Supplementary Fig. 4a,b>). Levels of other p-tau species, including pThr231 (AT180+), pThr181 (AT270+) or pSer396 (PHF13+) were also not significantly affected by K174Q expression (<Supplementary Fig. 4c–e>). Interestingly, K174Q expression led to higher levels of AT8-positive p-tau (Ser202/Thr205) than WT or K174R tau in hippocampus (<Supplementary Fig. 4f–i>). To determine how K174 acetylation affects toxicity of overexpressed hTau, we examined mouse hippocampal volumes three-month after injection of AAV1 vectors encoding WT, K174Q and K174R tau. As reported, AAV-induced expression of WT tau led to a loss of hippocampal volume<25>. Similar levels of K174Q tau induced worse hippocampal atrophy than WT (<Fig. 3a>) or K174R tau (<Fig. 3b>), suggesting that ac-K174 induces more severe neurodegeneration. To assess the functional outcome of elevated levels of ac-K174 in hippocampus, we used open field, small Y-maze, and Morris water maze (MWM) to measure hippocampal function. Hyperlocomotor activity in the open field is induced by hippocampal lesion<26>. Spontaneous alterations in the small Y-maze measure hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory, which was impaired in tauopathy mice expressing human tau with P301S mutation<27>. MWM is one of most common tests for hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory.In the open field, mice expressing K174Q exhibited significantly higher total activity than non-injected (NI) mice, while mice expressing comparable levels of WT or K174R tau behaved similarly as NI mice (<Fig. 3c>). Notably, the levels of K174Q tau monomers were positively correlated with total activity in the open field (<Fig. 3d>). In small Y-maze tests, hippocampal expression of K174Q, but not WT or K174R tau significantly reduced the percentage of spontaneous alternations (<Fig. 3e>), suggesting that ac-K174 tau impairs spatial working memory. In MWM tests, K174Q tau-expressing mice exhibited a slower learning curve than WT tau-expressing or NI mice in the first phase of spatial learning (<Fig. 3f>). K174Q tau-expressing mice also learned more slowly than K174R tau-expressing mice (<Fig. 3h>). After all groups were trained to criterion, we performed reversal training by moving the hidden platform to a new location. K174Q-, not WT tau- or K174R-expressing mice, located the new location more slowly than NI controls (<Fig. 3f,h>). These findings demonstrate that ac-K174 impairs spatial learning. In the probe trials that measure memory retention, K174Q tau-, not WT tau-expressing mice, crossed the target platform significantly fewer times than NI control mice, suggesting impaired memory retention induced by K174Q expression (<Fig. 3g>). The direct comparison between K174R and K174Q on memory retention was inconclusive since the NI control mice in this cohort showed no clear memory retention (<Fig. 3i>). The main acetyltransferases responsible for tau acetylation are p300 and its close homologue CBP<14>,<15>. To further examine the role of p300, we performed genetic deletion by infecting p300F/F primary mouse neurons with lenti-cre in culture (<Fig. 4a>). Deleting p300 lowered levels of total tau (t-tau), ac-K174, and p-tau (Ser202/Thr205) (<Fig. 4b>). Levels of ac-K174 or AT8-positive p-tau were also lowered relative to t-tau (<Fig. 4c>). We showed that pharmacological inhibition of p300 with C646 reduced levels of p-tau and ac-tau in primary neurons<14>. However, due to its poor brain permeability and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (not shown), we tested other small molecules that inhibit p300, including salicylate, one of the non-steroid ant-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Shirakawa et al., unpublished). In HEK293 cells, salicylate reduces acetylation of H2AK5, a well-established substrate of p300, in a dose-dependent manner (<Supplementary Fig. 5a>). In rat primary neurons infected with a lentiviral vector encoding WT hTau (Lenti-WT), salicylate reduced levels of p300 (<Fig. 4d>, left). Levels of ac-K174 (<Fig. 4d>, middle) and AT8-positive p-tau (<Fig. 4d>, right), relative to t-tau, were also reduced by salicylate treatment. Consistent with the notion that ac-K174 inhibits tau degradation, reduction of ac-K174 with salicylate enhanced tau turnover in primary neurons (<Supplementary Fig. 5b>).To examine the potential protective effects of p300 inhibition against tauopathy in vivo, we first sought to determine if p300 is aberrantly activated in the brains of PS19 mice. H3K18 acetylation has been used as a marker for p300/CBP activity since deleting p300 and its close homolog CBP leads to a complete loss of ac-H3K18<28>–<30>. Levels of ac-H3K18 were significantly higher in the brains of PS19 mice than those of age-matched controls (<Fig. 4e>). To inhibit p300/CBP in the brain, we treated PS19 mice with salsalate (SSA), a prodrug of salicylate used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. PK analysis showed that, upon absorption, SSA penetrates into the brain and gives rise to relatively stable salicylate levels over 8 h (<Supplementary Fig. 6>).We investigated the effects of SSA treatment in PS19 mice after the onset of tau-mediated spatial memory deficits. Two independent cohorts were tested: one cohort of 8–9-month-old female PS19 mice and controls, and the other 7–8-month-old male PS19 mice and controls. The male and female cohorts were tested separately to avoid the confounding effects of sex hormones on the other gender in behavior tests. SSA (225 mg/kg) or vehicle was dosed by oral gavage. The length of the treatment for female cohort was 60 days and for the male cohort was 84 days. The dose of 225 mg/kg was well tolerated; no weight difference was observed in vehicle- and SSA-treated PS19 mice during treatment (not shown)."
PMC4598295_2,"Inhibition of brain p300 was examined by measuring acetylation levels of well-established substrates for p300/CBP<29>–<31>, including ac-H3K18 (<Fig  4f>), Ac-H2AK5 (<Fig. 4g>), or ac-H2BK12K15 (<Fig. 4h>), all of which were reduced significantly by SSA treatment. These results demonstrated clear target engagement of SSA at 225 mg/kg in the brain.SSA treatment also reduced the levels of t-tau quantified with ELISA (<Fig. 4i>, left), while levels of tau mRNA were not affected (<Fig. 4i>, right). SSA did not affect acetylation or phosphorylation of the KXGS motif (<Supplementary Fig. 7>), consistent with a lack of effect induced by K174Q. Importantly, SSA induced a reduction in ac-K174 relative to t-tau, and a trend of reduction in AT8-positive p-tau, which did not reach significance when normalized to t-tau (<Fig. 4j>). We next determined whether inhibiting K174 tau acetylation ameliorates tau-mediated pathological and behavioral deficits. PS19 mice exhibit hippocampal atrophy at advanced ages<32>. In the female cohort, at 8 months, hippocampal volume of PS19 and non-transgenic (NTG) mice was similar (<Fig. 5a, b>). At 10 months of age, vehicle-treated PS19 exhibited significant hippocampal atrophy compared with NTG controls; SSA completely prevented hippocampal atrophy, restoring volume similar to that of 8-month-old NTG or PS19 mice (<Fig. 5a, b>). Similarly, male SSA-treated PS19 mice also exhibited significantly less hippocampal atrophy at 10 months of age (<Supplementary Fig. 8a, b>). Prominent NFTs and dystrophic neuritis, positive for Gallyas silver staining, were detected throughout the forebrains in PS19 mice (<Fig. 5c>). SSA reduced the number of Gallyas silver-positive neurons and neurites in the cortex and hippocampus of PS19 mice, in both the female (<Fig. 5c, d>), and the male cohorts (<Supplementary Fig. 8c, d>).To assess SSA’s effects on tau-mediated spatial learning and memory deficits, we performed MWM or fixed-location dry maze, which is a modified Barnes maze that measures spatial learning and memory, but less physically demanding than MWM<33>. The male cohort was tested in MWM. The female PS19 mice were tested in the dry maze since they were slightly older and appeared physically weaker than those in the male cohort. Mice in the fixed-location dry maze learned to locate the escape hole using spatial cues in the spatial learning segment. We observed no significant difference in learning rates for locating the escape hole among vehicle-treated NTG mice and vehicle- or SSA-treated PS19 mice (<Fig. 5e>). In the probe trial, while vehicle-treated NTG mice spent more time in the target quadrant than the non-target quadrant, vehicle-treated PS19 mice had no preference for the target quadrant, showing impaired memory retention and retrieval (<Fig. 5f>). SSA-treated PS19 mice spent more time in the target quadrant, showing improved spatial memory. Similarly, in the MWM, no spatial learning deficits were observed in the four groups (<Fig. 5g>). In the probe trial, vehicle-treated PS19 mice had no preference for the target quadrant (<Fig. 5h>). In contrast, SSA-treated PS19 mice showed similar preferences for the target quadrant as vehicle- or SSA-treated NTG groups, confirming SSA’s protective effects against tau-mediated memory impairments. To investigate the mechanism underlying the tau-lowering effects of salicylate, primary rat neurons were infected with AAV-WT or AAV-K174Q hTau and treated with salicylate. Salicylate induced similar extent of p300 inhibition in neurons expressing WT (<Fig. 6a,b>) or K174Q hTau (<Fig. 6d,e>) as levels of p300 and mouse t-tau were similarly reduced. However, while salicylate lowered levels of human WT tau (<Fig. 6c>), it failed to reduce those of K174Q tau (<Fig. 6f>), suggesting that salicylate’s tau-lowering effect requires inhibition of ac-K174 in primary neurons.We next determined if SSA’s beneficial effects involve inhibition of ac-K174 in vivo. Two-month after the injecting with AAV-K174Q, mice were treated with SSA daily as previously performed in PS19 mice. Ac-H2AK5 levels were reduced in the SSA-treated group, confirming inhibition of p300 by SSA (<Fig. 6g>). However, in contrast to the tau-lowering effects of SSA in PS19 mice, SSA treatment failed to reduce levels of t-tau in K174Q injected mice compared to vehicle treated controls (<Fig. 6h>). Levels of PHF1-postive p-tau relative to t-tau, or AT8-positive p-tau normalized by t-tau or GAPDH, were also not affected by SSA treatment (<Fig. 6i>). Moreover, SSA failed to prevent/reduce hippocampal atrophy in AAV-K174Q-injected mice (<Fig. 6j>), supporting the importance of ac-K174 inhibition in SSA’s protective effects. Here we report a critical role for acetylation of K174, an early pathological modification of soluble tau in AD brains, in tau accumulation and toxicity. Acetyl-mimicking tau mutant K174Q degrades slower than WT tau or K174R tau that mimics the non-acetylatable form. Hippocampal expression of K174Q, not WT or K174R tau, leads to accumulation of tau monomers that are associated with profound AD-related cognitive deficits. SSA inhibits p300, lowers ac-K174 levels in brain, and protects against behavioral deficits, hippocampal atrophy, and accumulation of NFTs in aged PS19 mice. The tau-lowering and protective effects of salicylate/SSA were diminished in neurons and mice expressing K174Q tau. Our findings point to inhibitors of tau acetylation as a novel therapeutic modality to treat tauopathies.Levels of ac-K174 were elevated at early Braak stages in AD brains, consistent with its role in early pathogenic alteration. In PS19 mice, ac-K174 co-localized remarkably with MC1, which is enriched in soluble tau in AD lysates and represents one of the earliest pathological tau conformations<20>,<21>. In addition to K174, other tau acetylation sites have been reported, including K274, K280 and K259/290/321/353 (KXGS motifs)<15>,<18>,<34>–<36>. Both ac-K274 and ac-K280 were found to be specifically associated with insoluble, Thioflavin-positive tau aggregates in AD and other tauopathy brains<34>–<36>. Although ac-K280 was implicated in deficient tau-microtubule interactions and pathological tau aggregation in vitro<15>, its pathogenicity in vivo has not been established. Acetylation of KIGS motif, which appeared to be reduced in AD brains, suppresses tau aggregation and promotes microtubule binding in vitro<18>. However, we showed that ac-K174 had few effects on acetylation or phosphorylation of KXGS motifs, suggesting that different tau acetylation sites may exert distinct effects on tau pathogenecity.Our findings established, for the first time, the pathogenicity of ac-tau in vivo. Behavioral deficits, including hyperactivity, working memory and spatial learning impairments, were observed in mice expressing K174Q tau, but not in mice expressing with similar levels of WT or K174R tau. The positive correlation of cognitive deficits with monomeric K174Q tau levels provides evidence supporting the pathogenicity of ac-K174 monomers. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration is exacerbated by ac-K174, but hippocampal atrophy was not abolished in mice expressing K174R, indicating that other mechanisms could be involved. Indeed, K174Q and K174R mutants enhance the formation of dimeric tau, which could be neurotoxic. Aberrant cell-cycle reentry induced by high levels of h-tau<25> could also contribute to neurodegeneration in mice injected with AAV-K174Q or -K174R. Our results also support a role of ac-K174 in tau homeostasis. Expressing K174Q, not K174R, leads to longer half-life in primary neurons and aberrant accumulation in vivo, showing that K174 acetylation per se, not the blockage of K174 polyubiquitination, impairs tau clearance. Interestingly, a recent mass-spec study provided clear evidence that acetylation and ubiquitination occurs on the same lysine residues, supporting an intimate relationship of these two modifications<37>.One of the main enzymes that acetylate tau is p300<14>, which can be inhibited by SS/SSA, an ancient drug commonly used as an NSAID."
PMC4598295_3,"Pharmacokinetically, SSA is quickly metabolized into its active component, salicylate  Unlike salicylate, aspirin (acetyl salicylate) elevates ac-tau in cultured neurons (not shown). SSA and aspirin had been widely used NSAIDs to treat rheumatoid arthritis and related illnesses in the past decades, presumably via inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases (COX)<38>. Interestingly, patients taking NSAIDs, including salicylate and derivatives, had a reduced risk of AD<39>. However, later trials with more specific COX-2 inhibitors failed to establish the benefits. One possible explanation is that the benefits of salicylate might involve mechanisms independent of COX2 inhibition, such as partial attenuation of p300 activity, which is identified recently as one of top dysregulated networks in AD brains<40>.The resistance of K174Q to the tau-lowering and protective effects of salicylate/SSA strongly supports that inhibition of ac-K174 as a key underlying mechanism. Treating with salicylate lowered levels of ac-tau and t-tau in primary neurons expressing WT tau, but not in those expressing K174Q tau. SSA lowered ac-K174 and t-tau, and protects against hippocampal atrophy in PS19 mice, but failed to reduce tau or to restore hippocampal volume in AAV-K174Q-injected mice. Other mechanisms are likely to be involved as well. For example, salicylate/SSA could also exert protection by enhancing autophagy via activation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK)<41>. The marked reduction of NFTs induced by SSA could be due to activation of autophagy. However, we did not observe significant LC3-II levels in SSA- vs. veh-treated PS19 brains (<Supplementary Fig. 9>). More comprehensive analyses are needed to fully address the involvement of autophagy. SSA-induced AMPK activation could also lead to p300 inhibition and degradation indirectly<42>,<43>. p300 is also critical for NF-κB activation and glial inflammatory responses<44>,<45>. We examined microgliosis or astrogliosis and observed no effects by SSA treatment, arguing against anti-inflammation as one of the main protective mechanisms (<Supplementary Fig. 10>).Our study provides first proof-of-principle evidence that partial p300 inhibitor could be used to treat tauopathies. Since p300 is important for many biological functions, completely inhibiting it could cause serious side effects. However, a recent study showed that p300 activity is aberrantly elevated in AD brains<40>. Identified as one of the top dysregulated pathways in AD, aberrantly activated p300 could underlie hyperacetylation of tau in tauopathies<40>. In moderate and severe AD cases, p300 activities were significantly higher in the CA1 region, where activated p300 and p-tau were colocalized<40>. p300 activity was also elevated in aged PS19 brains. Thus, partially inhibiting p300 could normalize its aberrant activation and suppress hyperacetylation of its substrates, including tau. Indeed, the remarkable protection of SSA against tau-mediated cognitive deficits and degeneration is unprecedented and could have important clinical implications. Even after disease onset in PS19 mice, SSA treatment improved spatial memory, reduced NFT formation, and abolished hippocampal atrophy, which is associated with increased risk for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD<46>–<48>. Importantly, the human equivalent dose of 225 mg/kg in the current study is ~1350 mg/day for a 75 kg person<49>, lower than the dose typically prescribed to human patients (3000 mg/day). Our study supports clinical evaluation of SSA and its derivatives as therapies in human tauopathies.

Expression plasmids: For expression in HEK293T cells, cDNA encoding WT, K163R, K174R, K274R, K280R, K369R, K174Q, or K274Q hTau was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). For expression in primary neurons, cDNA encoding WT, K174Q or K174R hTau was cloned into lentiviral FUGW vectors. Chemicals: MG-132 (Sigma), Cycloheximide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), DMSO (Sigma), IU1-47 (a kind gift from Dr. Daniel Finley). Salicylate (sodium salicylate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Salsalate tablet (75% purity) was from Amneal Pharmaceuticals (Glasgow, KY). Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially according to the manufacturer’s protocol: Pierce Direct IP Kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, antibody (monoclonal anti-Tau; ab80579, Abcam) was immobilized onto agarose gel with sodium cyanoborohydride. Then, brain homogenates lysed in RIPA buffer were applied to antibody-conjugated column and rotated overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed four times. Elution was performed in low pH elution buffer (pH 2.8), with neutralizing TRIS buffer (pH 9.5) in the collection tubes. Gel bands were manually excised out of the gel. Then, the gel spots were destained and dehydrated with acetonitrile. Subsequently, the proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 60°C for 30 min, alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide (37°C, 45 min) and incubated with 250 ng sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 37°C overnight. The proteolytic peptide mixtures obtained after tryptic digestion were analyzed by reversed-phase nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS with an Eksigent nano-LC 2D HPLC system (Eksigent), which was directly connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) QSTAR Elite mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX). Briefly, peptides were applied to a guard column (Dionex) and washed with the aqueous loading solvent (2% solvent B in A, flow rate: 20 μL/min) for 10 min. Subsequently, samples were transferred onto the analytical C18-nanocapillary HPLC column (Dionex) and eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min for most samples with a linear gradient 2–80% solvent B in A over 85 min. Solvents were prepared as follows, mobile phase A: 2% acetonitrile/98% of 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water, and mobile phase B: 98% acetonitrile/2% of 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water. Electrospray-mass spectra (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectra (ESI-MS/MS) were recorded in positive-ion mode with a resolution of 12,000–15,000 FWHM. For collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS), the mass window for precursor ion selection of the quadrupole mass analyzer was set to ± 1 m/z. The synthetic acetylated peptide IPAKacTPPAPK (from ThermoFisher Scientific/Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) for mass spectrometric comparison was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS with anEksigent Ultra Plus nano-LC 2D HPLC system connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX) as described<50>. Database searches were performed using Protein Pilot Software 4.5 revision 1656 (AB SCIEX) using the Paragon Algorithm 4.5.0.0.1654 developed by AB SCIEX<51> or an in-house Mascot server version 2.3.02.<52>. Peptides containing posttranslational modifications were manually inspected based on an adaptation of previously published criteria. Cells or human or mouse brain tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 5 mM nicotinamide (Sigma), and 1 μM trichostatin A (Sigma). After sonication, lysates from human or mouse brain were centrifuged at 170,000 g at 4°C for 15 min and 18,000 g at 4°C for 15 min."
PMC4598295_4,"Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad)  The same amount of proteins were resolved on a 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare), and probed with appropriate antibodies. Bands in immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and quantified by densitometry and ImageJ software (NIH). For purification of GST fusion proteins, h-tau 2N4R coding sequence was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression vector (Sigma) and transformed in BL21 (DE3) strain. After induction with 100 μM isopropyl β–D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were harvested and sonicated in phosphate buffered saline with 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% TritonX-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). GST tagged tau or p300 proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose beads (Genscript). In vitro acetylation reactions were performed essentially as described<53> with minor modifications. In brief, 1 μg of recombinant h-tau, 2 nM acetyl CoA (Sigma), and 100 ng of purified GST-p300 in acetylation buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10 mM Na butyrate) were incubated for 2 h at 30°C with constant shaking. Reactions were stopped by an addition of 2× LDS sampling buffer (Invitrogen), followed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses. Mouse primary neurons were cultured from genetically modified pups. To generate p300F/F neurons, cortices of neonatal pups from p300F/F homozygotes breeding (p300F/F mice were a kind gift of Dr. Paul Brindle (St. Jude Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA)) on postnatal day 0 or 1, and dissociated and plated as described previously<52>. All other experiments using primary neuronal cultures were derived from neonatal rats due to the higher yield. Briefly, cortices of Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River Laboratories) were dissociated on postnatal day 0 or 1. Purified mouse or rat cells were plated at 160,000 cells/ml in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) on poly-ornithine-coated plates. Lentivirus was generated, purified, and used for infection as described<54>. Recombinant lentivirus was produced by cotransfection of the shuttle vector (pRRL), two helper plasmids, delta8.9 packaging vector, and VSV-G envelope vector into 293T cells and purified by ultracentrifugation<52>. Viral titers were measured by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at the Gladstone-UCSF Laboratory of Clinical Virology. AAV1-WT, AAV1-K174Q and AAV1-K174R tau with CMV-β-actin promoter were generated and purified by GENEDETECT (Auckland 0600, New Zealand). Primary neuronal cultures were infected with either equal amount (~3–5 × 107 PFU) of lentiviral vectors or AAV1 (~5 × 108 genomic particles) expressing tau WT and mutants at days in vitro (DIV) 3–5. Once available, tau-expressing AAV1 vectors were used in later experiments since they exhibited less toxicity than lentiviral vectors. If necessary, viruses were diluted with conditioned medium for infection. All drug treatments and analyses were performed at DIV 8–11. Brain hippocampi from AAV-Tau injected mice were dissected and homogenized with a 21G needle in RLT buffer with 1% β-mercaptoethanol. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen), and the remaining DNA was removed by incubation with RNase-free DNase (Ambion). Purified messenger RNA was then converted to complementary DNA by the TaqMan reverse transcription (RT) kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the ABI 7900 HT sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The average value of three replicates of each sample was expressed as the threshold cycle (Ct), at which the fluorescence signal starts to increase rapidly. Then, the difference (ΔCt) between the Ct value for h-tau and the Ct value for mouse GAPDH (ΔCt = Ct(human tau)-Ct(GAPDH)) was calculated for each sample. The relative levels of gene expression for each sample was determined by 2−ΔCt and expressed as the-fold change. The following primers were used for quantitative RT-PCR: h-tau (forward, 5′-GTTGGGGGACAGGAAAGATCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGGAGCTCCCTCATC-3′), mouse GAPDH (forward, 5′-GGGAAGCCCATCACCATCTT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA-3′). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate K174Q and K174R mutants of the 0N4R tau isoform in a pET28a vector. WT and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by heat denaturation, followed by cation exchange chromatography<55>. For aggregation assays, tau proteins (10 μM) were incubated in assay buffer: D-PBS, pH 7.2 (Invitrogen), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT. Heparin (Santa Cruz, MW 6,000–25,000) was reconstituted in assay buffer then added at a final concentration of 44 μg/ml to induce tau aggregation. The aggregation assay was carried out at 37°C with agitation. When monitoring aggregation kinetics, Thioflavin T (ThT, Sigma) was dissolved in assay buffer and included in the reaction at a final concentration of 10 μM. The Thioflavin T fluorescence intensity was measured in a Spectramax M5 reader (Molecular Devices) set to excitation (444 nm)/emission (485 nm) with an emission cutoff of 480 nm. Samples were read in a 384-well plate format, in quadruplicate, at 37°C, with reads every 5 min and agitation between reads. Control reactions containing WT or mutant tau without heparin were included as baseline readings in each experiment. Baseline subtracted kinetic data was fit to the Gompertz equation<56>,<57>
y = Ae−e(t−ti)/b (1) where y = the fluorescence at time t, A is the maximum signal/amplitude of curve, ti is the inflection point, ti-b = lag time, and b = 1/kapp where kapp is the apparent elongation rate constant. Amplitude values are represented relative to WT controls for each experiment to adjust for day to day variations in absolute ThT signal intensity. Mice were assigned into gender- and age-matched treatment groups in a randomized manner. The sample size for each experiment was determined based on previous experience with each of the animal models used. For AAV-Tau injection experiments, male (C57BL/6) mice at 2–3 months of age were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility at UCSF with a 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. All behavior experiments were performed during daylight hours. All animal procedures were carried out under University of California, San Francisco, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved guidelines. For SSA treatment experiment, both female (first cohort) and male (second cohort) PS19 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed in a conventional facility at Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA) with a 12-h light/dark reverse cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. All behavior experiments of PS19 mice were performed during daylight hours and carried out under Stanford University School of Medicine, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved guidelines. Mice were anesthetized with avertin (250 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection, and secured on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). Equal amount (~ 3 X 109 genomic particles) of AAV1 expressing tau WT, tau K174Q and tauK174R mutant were injected into dentate gyrus of 3-month-old mice by stereotaxic injection at a rate of 0.5 μl/min. The following coordinates were used (anterior-posterior -2.1, medial-lateral ±1.7, dorsal-ventral -2.1). Oral gavage was performed either at the animal facility at Stanford University (for PS19 mice) or at Preclinical Therapeutics Core, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (for AAV-injected wildtype mice). Each group was assigned for a different treatment in a semi-random manner. The dosers were blinded to the genotypes or of the mice or vectors injected. In the first PS19 cohort, two groups of 8–9-month-old PS19 female mice and one group of NTG littermate controls were used in the study. PS19 mice were administered with vehicle (PEG400: Tween 20 (4:1)) or SSA (225 mg/kg body weight) for 7 days a week via daily single oral gavage ingestion (100 μl solution per 10 g body weight)."
PMC4598295_5,"NTG littermates were administered with vehicle  Dosing was administered for 5 weeks before the initiation of the behavioral tests, and continued until the mice were sacrificed (60 days in total). In the repeat cohort, two groups (vehicle and SSA) of 7–8-month-old PS19 male mice and two groups (vehicle and SSA) of NTG littermate controls were used. The vehicle used in cohort 2 contained PEG-400 (10%, v/v), Tween-80 (10%, v/v), Labrasol (10%, v/v), hydroxpropyl beta-cyclodextrin (20%, w/v), sodium phosphate (mono-basic), sodium phosphate (dibasic) and sodium chloride. Dosing was administered for about 60 days before the initiation of the MWM test, and continued until the mice were sacrificed (86 days in total). Body weights of animals were monitored once a week. In AAV-TauK174Q injected cohort, 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice were injected with AAV-TauK174Q. After 2 months of post-injection, mice were daily treated either with vehicle or SSA (225 mg/kg body weight) for 6 weeks until the mice were sacrificed. Experimenters were blind to the genotypes or treatment of the mice. For quantification of hippocampal volume, mice hemibrains were cut at 30 μm coronally, and all hippocampi, including sections, were collected. Brain sections were mounted on microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) in an anterior to posterior order, starting from the section where the hippocampal structure first becomes visible (1st section) to the section where hippocampal structure just disappears (last section). Mice with missing sections were excluded from the analyses, a pre-established criterion. Mounted brain sections were dried at room temperature for 24 h and stained with cresyl violet (nissl staining). After being defatted for 15 min in 100% xylene and 10 min in 100% ethanol, followed by rehydration, sections were stained in 0.1% cresyl violet solution and mounted in DePeX mounting medium (VWR). Images were acquired with a Keyence BZ-9000 microscope. Hippocampal volume was estimated using ImageJ (NIH) Volumest plugin (http://lepo.it.da.ut.ee/~markkom/volumest/). Usually 10–12 hippocampal-containing sections were used for each analysis. For immunostaining, floating sections were permeabilized and incubated in blocking solution (10% normal goat serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 TBST) at room temperature for 1 h. Anti-HT7 (MN1000, Thermo Scientific) were incubated, and immunoreactive structures were detected with either Alexa Fluor 488- or 555-secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). For AC312 immunostaining, to reduce the non-specific nuclear staining, the antibody was pre-absorbed by acetone Tau KO mice brain powder. Antigen retrieval was first performed by heating the sections in 10 mM citric acid at 90°C for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with brain powder pre-absorbed AC312 and AT8 (Fisher) or MC1. After overnight incubation, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies including Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories). All images were acquired by DM5000B microscope (Leica) or CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon) with 60× oil immersion objective lens and analyzed by either Micro-Manager software (UCSF) or imageJ software (NIH). For orthogonal images, images were collected as Z stacks with size of Z step as 0.15 microns and total 2.5 microns stacked images were rendered for orthogonal view with Image J software. Gallyas silver staining was performed as described<58>. Briefly, sections were placed in 5% periodic acid followed by alkaline silver iodide solution and developer solution. After washing with acetic acid and water, they were placed in 0.1% gold chloride, followed by sodium thiosulphate solution, washed and counterstained in 0.1% nuclear fast red. For quantification, three sections were analyzed by bright light digital microscopy with an Olympus BX41 microscopy. Four fields per section and brain region were analyzed at 400X, and silver-positive neuronal cell bodies and neurites were estimated and averaged per 0.1 mm2. SSA was administered to C57B6 mice of both males and females via oral garage as a single bolus dose. Mice were sacrificed at predetermined time points and plasma and brain tissue samples were harvested for analysis by PPL labs (Redwood City, CA). SSA and its metabolite SA were measured simultaneously using oxopropanoyloxy benzoic acid as an internal standard solution<59>. To extract SSA/SA from brain, 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was added to 30–50 mg of cortical tissue, followed by homogenization and vortexing. After addition of 200 μl of the internal standard solution, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were transferred for injection. To measure SSA/SA in the plasma, 10 μl of plasma samples were mixed with 90 μl H2O and 100 μl of Internal Standard Solution, followed by centrifugation and injection. The HPLC was performed in C18 column, following a gradient program (10–90% acetonitrile in 6 min) with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The injection volume is ~ 5 μl. The mass spectrometry analyses were perform on 3200 Q TRAP system (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA) using MQL algorithm. High-binding black 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated with 2.5 μg/ml HT7 capture antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8. After incubating at 4°C overnight, plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, followed by TBST wash (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20). Plates were washed with TBST before the addition of 50 μl per well diluted PS19 mice brain lysates and h-tau441, diluted in a TBS assay buffer, pH 8. Assay plates containing samples and standards were incubated overnight at 4°C while shaking. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated Tau5 antibody was diluted into assay buffer before being added to the assay plate (50 μl per well) to co-incubate with PS19 mice brain lysates and htau441 standards for 1 h at room temperature while shaking. Plates were washed with TBST before being developed using alkaline phosphatase substrate (T2214; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Luminescence counts were measured using SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Log-transformed luminescence counts from individual samples were interpolated to concentration using a third-order polynomial fit to the respective standards (GraphPad Prism 5.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). PS19 mice tau levels were plotted after correction for dilution factor. Experimenters were blind to the genotypes or treatments of the mice for all behavioral analyses. The water maze consisted of a pool (122 cm in diameter) containing opaque water (20 ± 1°C) and a platform (14 cm in diameter) submerged 1.5 cm under the water. Hidden platform training (days 1–5) consisted of 10 sessions (two per day, 2 h apart), each with three trials. The mouse was placed into the pool at alternating drop locations for each trial. A trial ended when the mouse located the platform. The maximum trial time was 60 s per trial. Mice that failed to find the platform within 60 s trial were led to it and placed on it for 15 s. After the initial learning task, a reversal learning protocol (days R1–R4; two per day, 2 h apart) was conducted for the same mice. The hidden platform was moved to the opposite quadrant for reversal learning. For probe trial, 48 h after the final reversal training trial, mice were returned to the pool with a new drop location in the absence of hidden platform. Performance was measured with an EthoVision video-tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). Visible platform training, where the platform was cued with a mounted black-and-white striped mast, was conducted for four trials after completion of probe trials. The pre-established exclusion criterion is that mice that floated or did not swim would be excluded from analysis. Mice were placed in the center of a small Y-maze (arm length: 15 cm) and spontaneous alternation was recorded in a single continuous 6 min trial by a live observer. Each of the three arms was designated a letter A–C, and entries into the arms were recorded."
PMC4598295_6,"The percent of spontaneous alternation was calculated over the total number of entries possible  The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials. Mice were placed individually into brightly lit automated activity cages equipped with rows of infrared photocells interfaced with a computer (San Diego Instruments). After a 1-min adaptation period, open field activity was recorded for 20 min. Recorded beam breaks were used to calculate active times, path lengths, rearing times, and rearing events. After behavioral testing, the apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials. Experiments were performed at animal facility at Stanford University. Mice were housed at a standard temperature (22 ± 1 °C), in a reverse light-controlled environment (lights off from 8:30 am to 8:30 pm) with ad libitum access to food and water. Animals are group-housed with minimal enrichment such as shelter (paper towel tubes and nestlets). The experimenter remained blinded to the experimental groups throughout the entire study. A custom built dry maze was used, which is a 122-cm diameter circular platform with 40 escape holes (5 cm in diameter). The target escape tube is attached to one of these holes; all other holes except the target escape hole are left open. High overhead lighting (~750 lux) and air turbulence created by fans are used as aversive stimuli to encourage the animals to seek out the target escape hole. All aversive stimuli are turned off when the mouse enters the target escape hole. Visual cues are provided around the maze for navigation. The subjects are monitored by a video tracking system directly above maze, and the parameters are measured using the computer software Ethovision. Subjects are given four trials to find the target escape hole with a 2-min inter-trial-interval. Each trial is 90 s long. Animals that could not find the escape hole were led by the experimenter and allowed to enter the target escape hole. After each trial, the apparatus was cleaned with 1% Virkon to eliminate odor cues. After 2 days of training and 3 days of learning, mice are tested in a probe trial. During the probe, the escape tube is removed from the maze and the mice are allowed to explore the maze. Time in each quadrant is recorded and memory is assessed by the time spent in the target quadrant versus the other three quadrants. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism v.5 (GraphPad) or STATA12 (StataCorp LP). Differences between means were assessed with paired or unpaired Student’s t test, one-way or two-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc testing of all pairwise comparisons among genotypes (with Tukey-Kramer correction or Dunnett’s test for one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for two-way ANOVA), or by mixed effects model, as indicated. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to quantify the linear relationship between two variables. The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was applied to all data sets, and in cases where the data did not demonstrate a normal distribution, non-parametric tests were used to analyze statistical differences. The Mann-Whitney test was used for unpaired t-tests, the Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used for paired comparisons, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for ANOVAs. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model fit using STATA12 were used to compare learning curves in MWM and fixed location dry maze; random intercepts and linear time slopes for each mouse were taken into account for the correlation among repeated observations. Outliers are pre-established as data outside of mean ± 2SD. All samples or animals were included for statistical analysis unless otherwise noted in pre-established criteria. rhetorical Figure 1 (a) ESI-MS/MS tandem mass spectra of Lys-acetylated peptide IPAKAcTPPAPK (residues 171–180) with a Protein Pilot confidence score of 99 obtained after trypsin digestion of immunoprecipitated Tau from AD brains.

WT, wild-type. Tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases in which tau fibrils accumulate. Recent evidence supports soluble tau species as the major toxic species. How soluble tau accumulates and how it causes neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we identified tau acetylation at K174 as an early change in AD brains and as a critical determinant in tau homeostasis and toxicity in mice. An acetyl-mimicking mutant (K174Q) slows down tau turnover and induces cognitive deficits in vivo. The acetyltransferase p300-induced tau acetylation is inhibited by a prescription drug salsalate/salicylate, which enhances tau turnover and reduces tau levels. In the PS19 transgenic mouse model of FTD, administering salsalate after disease onset inhibited p300 activity, lowered ac-K174 and total tau levels, rescued tau-induced memory deficits and prevented hippocampal atrophy."

PMC5719408_0,"Microtubule-associated proteins regulate microtubule dynamics, bundle actin filaments, and cross-link actin filaments with microtubules. In addition, aberrant interaction of the microtubule-associated protein Tau with filamentous actin is connected to synaptic impairment in Alzheimer’s disease. Here we provide insight into the nature of interaction between Tau and actin filaments. We show that Tau uses several short helical segments to bind in a dynamic, multivalent process to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. Although a single Tau helix is sufficient to bind to filamentous actin, at least two, flexibly linked helices are required for actin bundling. In agreement with a structural model of Tau repeat sequences in complex with actin filaments, phosphorylation at serine 262 attenuates binding of Tau to filamentous actin. Taken together the data demonstrate that bundling of filamentous actin and cross-linking of the cellular cytoskeleton depend on the metamorphic and multivalent nature of microtubule-associated proteins. The microtubule associated protein Tau also interacts with filamentous actin. Here the authors combine biophysical experiments and NMR studies to characterize the structural changes that occur in Tau upon binding to filamentous actin and show that phosphorylation of serine 262 attenuates actin binding of Tau.

Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) bind to stabilize and promote assembly of microtubules<1>, <2>. In addition, MAPs bundle actin filaments and cross-link the cellular cytoskeleton formed by microtubules and actin filaments (Fig. <1>a)<3>–<10>. The interaction of MAPs with actin is important for neurite outgrowth<11>, <12>. Representative MAPs are MAP1a, MAP1b, MAP2a, MAP2b, MAP2c, MAP4, and Tau, and isoforms of these proteins, which are often generated by alternative splicing<2>. Tau occurs in six different isoforms in the human central nervous system<13>, <14>. The Tau isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal inserts and have either three or four imperfect repeats in their C-terminal half<15>. The imperfect repeats are important for binding to both microtubules and actin. In addition, short fragments of the microtubule-binding domain of Tau promote actin bundling<16>. Proteins from the MAP2 family also bind to actin filaments through their repeat domain<8>. Because a single repeat interacts with both monomeric and filamentous actin, but does not bundle actin filaments, more than one microtubule-binding repeat is believed to be required for bundling of filamentous actin (F-actin)<17>. Little is known, however, about the molecular nature of the Tau/F-actin complex, about the involved binding sites, the mechanism of F-actin bundling and the MAP-driven process of cross-linking of microtubules and actin filaments. rhetorical Fig. 1 Tau interacts with and bundles filamentous actin. a Schematic representation of the importance of MAPs for the cellular cytoskeleton.

Little is known, however, about the molecular nature of the Tau/F-actin complex, about the involved binding sites, the mechanism of F-actin bundling and the MAP-driven process of cross-linking of microtubules and actin filaments. Misfolding and aberrant accumulation of Tau is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)<18>, <19>. Occurrence of Tau deposits correlates with the loss of cognitive functions in AD, suggesting a connection between Tau and synaptic transmission<20>. Because Tau directly interacts with actin and regulate its stability<3>, <4>, <21>, <22>, the interaction of Tau with actin might influence synaptic plasticity. This is particularly the case for the interaction with filamentous actin, which plays an important role in dendritic spine morphology and postsynaptic reorganizations<23>. In agreement with the disease relevance of the Tau/actin interaction, actin-rich paracrystalline inclusions, so-called Hirano bodies, are found in brain histopathological samples of AD and related tauopathies<24>, <25>. In addition, acetylation of Tau modulates actin polymerization and enhances synaptic dysfunction<26>.A molecular understanding of the interaction of MAPs with filamentous actin is complicated by the dynamic structure of microtubule-associated proteins<15>, <27>. MAPs such as Tau belong to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins, which do not fold into a stable three-dimensional structure<28>. In addition, intrinsically disordered proteins often contain multiple binding sites with each binding site only providing low affinity for a target protein. In case of F-actin, the high molecular weight of actin filaments further complicates structural analysis of the complex between actin filaments and MAPs. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical methods, we here dissect the regions in both Tau and F-actin that are important for complex formation. We then provide high-resolution information about the structural changes that occur when Tau binds to F-actin and show that conformational changes in specific regions, which are separated by flexible linkers, are responsible for bundling of actin filaments as well as for cross-linking of actin filaments with microtubules. Our results thus clarify the nature of interaction between actin and MAPs and the actin/microtubule crosstalk. The ability of Tau to bundle F-actin was studied using electron microscopy (EM). The diameter of single actin filaments was approximately 7 nm, in agreement with previous studies<29>, <30>. Addition of an equimolar concentration of Tau caused bundling of F-actin (Fig."
PMC5719408_1," <1b>), although some single filaments remained  Actin bundles ranged between 20 and 150 nm in diameter. Next, Tau/F-actin co-sedimentation was performed. The same sample, which was used for EM, was exposed to two sequential steps of centrifugation, in which single-actin filaments and actin bundles were collected separately. Subsequently, aliquots from supernatant (SN), filament (PF), and bundle (PB) fractions were loaded in a 4–20% gradient gel (Fig. <1c>). Quantification of the intensity of different bands indicated that ~63% of Tau remained in the supernatant. In addition, ~8% of Tau molecules were bound to single filaments, while ~29% of Tau was found together with actin bundles. The data demonstrate that Tau bundles actin filaments.In order to gain insight into the affinity of the Tau/F-actin-interaction, the change in fluorescence of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-labeled F-actin upon addition of Tau was followed<31>. 0.2 μM of NBD-labeled and phalloidin-stabilized F-actin were mixed with increasing amounts of Tau (Fig. <1d> and Supplementary Fig. <1>). A fit to the experimental data using a single-binding site model resulted in a dissociation constant of 60 ± 10 nM. Other stoichiometries, however, cannot be excluded. The derived dissociation constant is lower than a previously reported value of 241 ± 43 nM<7>. This is likely due of differences in ionic strength, because previous studies used phosphate buffer<7>, while we chose general actin assembly buffer.In order to identify residues in Tau that bind to F-actin, we used NMR spectroscopy. F-actin and 15N-labeled Tau were mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio and a two-dimensional (2D) 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment was recorded. Comparison with a reference spectrum of Tau alone showed that addition of F-actin into the Tau pool decreased the signal intensity of several Tau residues (Fig. <1e> and Supplementary Fig. <2>). Very little chemical shift changes were observed, indicating that the binding process is intermediate to slow on the NMR time scale. According to the resonance assignment of Tau<27>, cross-peaks from residues such as S262, N265, and T319 were strongly attenuated. Other residues including T175 and T217 were less affected, and S46 and S64 were not perturbed. Figure <1f> highlights the sequence specific intensity ratio of all non-overlapping cross-peaks of Tau in the presence and absence of F-actin. High (I
bound/I
free) values are expected for residues that do not directly bind to F-actin. In contrast, residues, which are bound to F-actin, should have low (I
bound/I
free) values, because their resonances would—due to the high molecular weight of the complex—be attenuated. The analysis reveals that the proline-rich regions P1–P2 and the four pseudo-repeats contribute to the Tau/F-actin interaction. The strongest NMR signal attenuation was observed for K254-V287, K294-K331, and E342-D358 (Fig. <1f>), suggesting that these Tau residues have the highest affinity toward F-actin. Consistent with this hypothesis, the cross-peaks of these residues were attenuated by F-actin also at higher ionic strength (Supplementary Fig. <3>). Sequence analysis showed that K254-V287, K294-K331, and E342-D358 comprise some of the most hydrophobic parts of the Tau sequence (Supplementary Fig. <3a>)<27>. In order to gain insight into how Tau regulates the polymerization and structure of F-actin, we sought to obtain information about the Tau-binding site on F-actin. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy showed that several actin-binding proteins bind to a hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of G-actin<32>. One of these binding partners is cofilin, a 21 kDa eukaryotic protein, which binds to F-actin with a K
d < 0.05 µM<33> and results in disassembly of F-actin<34>, <35>. Cryo-electron microscopy further showed that the binding site of cofilin on F-actin is highly similar to its binding site on G-actin (Fig. <2a>)<32>. To test if the binding site of Tau on F-actin overlaps with that of cofilin, we added a 10-fold excess of cofilin to a solution containing 15N-labeled Tau and 1.5-fold excess (with respect to Tau) of F-actin. For the resulting mixture, a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was recorded. After addition of cofilin, Tau’s NMR resonance intensities and positions were similar to those in the absence of F-actin (Fig. <2b>), indicating that (i) Tau is no longer bound to F-actin and (ii) cofilin does not bind to Tau. Subsequently, we repeated the actin/Tau co-sedimentation assay in the presence of cofilin. In agreement with the NMR data, addition of cofilin decreased the amount of Tau that co-sedimented with F-actin (Fig. <2c>). The observation that cofilin, but no Tau, co-precipitates with actin filaments (Fig. <2c>) also indicates that actin filaments were not disassembled by cofilin. rhetorical Fig. 2 Tau binds to the hydrophobic pocket of actin. a 3D structure of F-actin (pink) in complex with cofilin (light blue) (PDB id: 3J0S). b Influence of a 10-fold excess of cofilin on 1H-15N cross-peak intensities of Tau in presence of F-actin (Tau/F-actin molar ratio of 1:1.5).

For comparison, the attenuation of Tau signals by diamagnetic F-actin is shown (black bars) In order to gain insight into how Tau regulates the polymerization and structure of F-actin, we sought to obtain information about the Tau-binding site on F-actin. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy showed that several actin-binding proteins bind to a hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of G-actin<32>. One of these binding partners is cofilin, a 21 kDa eukaryotic protein, which binds to F-actin with a K
d < 0.05 µM<33> and results in disassembly of F-actin<34>, <35>. Cryo-electron microscopy further showed that the binding site of cofilin on F-actin is highly similar to its binding site on G-actin (Fig. <2a>)<32>. To test if the binding site of Tau on F-actin overlaps with that of cofilin, we added a 10-fold excess of cofilin to a solution containing 15N-labeled Tau and 1.5-fold excess (with respect to Tau) of F-actin. For the resulting mixture, a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was recorded. After addition of cofilin, Tau’s NMR resonance intensities and positions were similar to those in the absence of F-actin (Fig. <2b>), indicating that (i) Tau is no longer bound to F-actin and (ii) cofilin does not bind to Tau. Subsequently, we repeated the actin/Tau co-sedimentation assay in the presence of cofilin. In agreement with the NMR data, addition of cofilin decreased the amount of Tau that co-sedimented with F-actin (Fig. <2c>). The observation that cofilin, but no Tau, co-precipitates with actin filaments (Fig. <2c>) also indicates that actin filaments were not disassembled by cofilin. To further support binding of Tau to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin, we used the effect of paramagnetic centers on NMR resonances. Particularly powerful are paramagnetic nitroxide tags such as (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL), because the attachment of MTSSL to a cysteine in the protein causes enhanced relaxation of nearby (less than ~25 Å from the paramagnetic center) protons<36>. Although actin contains five cysteine residues, a number of studies has shown that the C-terminal C374, which is in close proximity to actin’s hydrophobic pocket (Fig."
PMC5719408_2," <2d>), is most solvent exposed (Supplementary Fig  <4a, b>) and incorporates more than 70% of spin labels during spin labeling reactions<37>–<41>. We thus labeled G-actin primarily at C374 with MTSSL, followed by polymerization of the MTSSL-tagged protein into F-actin. Subsequently, 15N-labeled Tau protein was added to reach a molar ratio of 1:2 (F-actin in excess) and a 1H-15N HSQC of Tau was recorded. Comparison with the spectrum recorded in the presence of diamagnetic F-actin revealed residue-specific paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) (Fig. <2e>). The PRE profile contained seven peaks corresponding to Tau residues L243-A246, K259-K267, V275-L284, S289-S293, S305-V313, S320-H330, and K375-F378 (Fig. <2e>, Supplementary Fig. <4c>).Observation of PRE broadening at the chemical shift of unbound Tau demonstrates that the Tau molecule exchanges between the F-actin-bound and free state. Because of the simultaneous observation of line broadening upon addition of diamagnetic F-actin (Fig. <1f>; Supplementary Fig. <2>), the exchange process is intermediate on the NMR chemical shift time scale. In addition to residue-specific PRE effects within and close to the repeat domain, a gradually increasing PRE effect was observed from approximately residue 170 toward the N terminus. Because this region showed less sequence-specific variation, we suggest that the broadening effect is the result of unspecific binding of the N-terminal half of Tau to the surface of F-actin. In addition, there might be contributions from paramagnetic broadening, when individual actin filaments come together in bundles, as well as from cysteine residues other than C374, which might have been labeled by MTSL at low levels. In contrast to the gradually increasing PRE effect in the N-terminal half of the protein, very little PRE effect was observed for residues 400 to 441 at the C terminus of Tau. The combined data—(i) competition of binding of Tau to F-actin by cofilin, which interacts with actin’s hydrophobic pocket, and (ii) residue-specific PRE effects in the repeat domain of Tau by preferential MTSSL-labeling of C374 in proximity to the hydrophobic pocket—suggest that Tau binds to the solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket that is located between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. Truncation of Tau by caspases and endopeptidases has been suggested to constitute an important pathogenic step in AD<42>, <43>. Many of the released fragments comprise part of the repeat domain of Tau and were found to form insoluble aggregates more rapidly<44>. Supported by these findings, several studies have used an artificial fragment of Tau, K18, which comprises all four repeats of the largest Tau isoform (residues Gln244–Glu372 plus initial Met243) (Supplementary Fig. <5a>), in order to gain insight into pathogenic processes in AD. We therefore tested whether K18 is able to bind to and bundle filamentous actin. Indeed, K18 bound with a Kd of 110 ± 1 nM to F-actin (Supplementary Fig. <1>). The lower affinity when compared to full-length Tau is in agreement with the contribution of regions outside of the repeat domain to the F-actin interaction (Figs. <1>f and <2b, e>; Supplementary Fig. <2>). In addition, K18 was capable of bundling F-actin (Supplementary Fig. <5b>). The above data suggest that Tau does not bind as a single rigid entity to F-actin. Instead, short hydrophobic Tau segments, which are separated from each other by flexible residues, bind dynamically to actin’s hydrophobic pocket (Fig. <2>). To gain insight into the structure, which these segments adopt in complex with F-actin, we used the peptide Tau(254–290), which bundles filaments (Fig. <3a>). NMR Nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) measurements that are sensitive for three-dimensional structure were subsequently performed. Because the peptide cannot be directly observed by solution-state NMR in complex with the megadalton-sized F-actin, we took advantage of the lower affinity and high off-rates of the peptides from the F-actin surface. This approach is called transfer NOE and has been widely used to determine the structure of small ligands in complex with high molecular weight binding partners<45>. In addition, we recently showed that the transfer NOE effect can be used to analyze structural changes that occur upon binding of Tau peptides to microtubules<46>. rhetorical Fig. 3 Tau(254–290) adopts helical structure upon binding to filamentous actin. a Electron micrograph demonstrating bundling of F-actin in presence of Tau(254–290). b Amide–amide region from 2D NOE spectra of Tau(254–290) in the presence (blue) and absence (red) of F-actin. c Ten lowest-energy conformers of F-actin bound Tau(254–290).

Side chains of selected residues are shown. f Sequence alignment of cofilin with residues 268–254 of Tau The above data suggest that Tau does not bind as a single rigid entity to F-actin. Instead, short hydrophobic Tau segments, which are separated from each other by flexible residues, bind dynamically to actin’s hydrophobic pocket (Fig. <2>). To gain insight into the structure, which these segments adopt in complex with F-actin, we used the peptide Tau(254–290), which bundles filaments (Fig. <3a>). NMR Nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) measurements that are sensitive for three-dimensional structure were subsequently performed. Because the peptide cannot be directly observed by solution-state NMR in complex with the megadalton-sized F-actin, we took advantage of the lower affinity and high off-rates of the peptides from the F-actin surface. This approach is called transfer NOE and has been widely used to determine the structure of small ligands in complex with high molecular weight binding partners<45>. In addition, we recently showed that the transfer NOE effect can be used to analyze structural changes that occur upon binding of Tau peptides to microtubules<46>. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments with five different mixing times ranging from 50 up to 250 ms were recorded for Tau(254–290) in the presence of F-actin. Analysis of NOE signal intensities as a function of mixing time suggested that spin diffusion did not significantly contribute to the observed NOE intensities (Supplementary Fig. <6a>). Figure <3b> shows part of the amide-amide region of a NOESY spectrum of Tau(254–290) in the absence (red) and presence (blue) of F-actin. Because of the binding of the peptide to F-actin, additional NOE cross-peaks were observed (Fig. <3b>; Supplementary Fig. <7>). The NOE peaks, which were observed only in the presence of F-actin, provide experimental restraints for the structure of Tau(254–290) in complex with F-actin.The NOE cross-peaks were sequence-specifically assigned using 2D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra (Supplementary Table <1>). On the basis of the resonance assignment, several medium-range, but no long-range contacts were identified (Supplementary Fig. <7>). To obtain insight into the conformation that is responsible for the observed medium-range contacts, we analyzed cross-peaks that are characteristic for regular secondary structure (Supplementary Figs. <6b> and <7>). The analysis showed that the N- and C terminus of Tau(254–290) remain unstructured in complex with F-actin. In contrast, medium-range NOE cross-peaks, which are specific for secondary structure, were observed for residues ~260 to ~268 and residues ~277 to ~283. The corresponding residues in full-length Tau experienced PRE broadening (Fig. <2e>; Supplementary Figure 4c).Subsequently, experimental NOE contacts were used to calculate structural models of Tau(254–290) in complex with F-actin. To minimize NOE contributions from unbound molecules, intra-residual and sequential NOE contacts were excluded from the calculations."
PMC5719408_3,"Thus, a total of 182 restraints went into the structure calculation, with 1 8 and 6.0 Å as lower and upper distance limits, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <6d>). The use of such broad distance limits is required, because an accurate calibration of NOE intensities is not possible. The 10 lowest-energy conformations are presented in Fig. <3c, d>. Analysis of secondary structure in the lowest energy conformation using STRIDE<47>, identifies α-helix for residues 261–268 and 3–10 helix for residues 277–280. In some of the other conformers of Tau(254–290), however, residues 261–265 were identified not as α-helix but as 3–10 helix, while residues 277–283 were assigned to α-helix. The analysis suggests that the experimental NOE data witness the formation of helical structure in these regions upon binding to F-actin, but the number of detected restraints is not sufficient to define a unique conformation. In addition, the relative orientation of the two helical regions (residues 261–268 and 277–280) is not defined due to the lack of long-range contacts. Instead, the presence of a proline residue followed by three glycines in between the two helical regions suggests that the intervening residues remain flexible. To derive a structural model for the Tau/F-actin binding site, we integrated the information that was obtained in the current work (Figs. <1>–<3>) with the 3D structure of cofilin-decorated F-actin (Fig. <2a>). To this end, the lowest energy conformation of Tau(254–290) was docked to the solvent-exposed, hydrophobic pocket of actin within the actin filament structure using the software Haddock<48>. Haddock clustered 192 complex structures in four clusters, representing 96.0% of the water-refined Haddock models. Within the highest scoring cluster (Supplementary Fig. <8>), the N-terminal helical region of Tau(254–290) was bound to the hydrophobic pocket of F-actin (Fig. <3e>).The docking model of the Tau(254–290)/F-actin complex was compared with the 3D structure of cofilin-decorated F-actin (Fig. <3e>). The comparison showed that the helical region of Tau(254–290) is positioned in the binding pocket in a similar way as the recognition helix of cofilin (blue). In this model, L266 of Tau(254–290) is 4 Å away from I345 of F-actin, while the HE atom of the cofilin residue M115 is 3.1 Å separated from the HG2 atom of actin’s I341. In addition, I260 of Tau(254–290) was found in a similar location as I124 from cofilin. In agreement with the structural similarity, the involved sequences from cofilin and Tau can be aligned (Fig. <3f>). Optimal sequence alignment was achieved, when the sequence of Tau was inverted (Fig. <3f>), suggesting an inverted orientation of its recognition helix when compared to cofilin (Fig. <3e>; Supplementary Fig. <9>). Although a three-residue gap is present in the alignment (Fig. <3f>), this gap appears to be compensated by a more extended structure of Tau (black in Fig. <3e>) when compared to the α-helix conformation of residues S119-A123 of F-actin bound cofilin (blue in Fig. <3e>).The docking model (Fig. <3e>) suggests an important role of the Tau residue L266 for binding to F-actin. We therefore prepared a mutant version of Tau(254–290), in which L266 was replaced by a glutamate, i.e., Tau(254–290)-L266E. We then used saturation transfer difference (STD)<49> experiments to probe the influence of the mutation on binding of Tau(254–290) to F-actin. When compared to the wild-type peptide, Tau(254–290)-L266E showed a decreased STD signal (Supplementary Figure <10c–e>), indicating that the mutation attenuated F-actin binding. Moreover, no additional cross-peaks were observed in the NOESY spectrum of Tau(254–290)-L266E in the presence of F-actin (Supplementary Fig. <10a, b>), i.e., no transfer NOE effect occurred. In agreement with a decrease in affinity of Tau(254–290)-L266E for binding to F-actin (Supplementary Fig. <1>), the mutant peptide was less efficient in promoting F-actin bundling (Supplementary Fig. <10f>). Two helical regions, which are separated from each other by flexible residues, are formed in Tau(254–290) upon binding to F-actin (Fig. <3c, d>). The two helices might be formed simultaneously, when a single molecule binds to F-actin, potentially folding in a cooperative manner. Alternatively, individual Tau(254–290) molecules can bind to F-actin either through residues ~260 to ~268 or through residues ~277 to ~283, while the other region will not be bound. Because of the ensemble nature of NMR measurements, the structures shown in Fig. <3> do not distinguish between these two mechanisms. In addition, other segments of Tau (Fig. <2b, e>) are likely to change conformation upon binding to F-actin. To gain insight into these different mechanisms, we prepared the peptides Tau(292–319) and Tau(254–268).Tau(292–319) comprises the residues of repeat R2 and R3, which experience strong signal attenuation upon addition of F-actin to full-length Tau (Fig. <1e, f>). In agreement with the ability of Tau(292–319) to bind to F-actin, the peptide promotes bundling of actin filaments (Supplementary Fig. <5c>). NOE experiments of Tau(292–319) in the absence and presence of F-actin revealed NOEs specific for the Tau(292–319)/F-actin complex (Supplementary Fig. <11>). Sequential assignment of Tau(292–319) (Supplementary Table <2>) showed that the F-actin specific NOEs are medium-range (Supplementary Figs. <11> and <12>), which were subsequently submitted to structure calculation. Supplementary Figures <12a–c> illustrate the resulting lowest energy conformations. Analysis of secondary structure using STRIDE<47> indicated that there is quite some variation in the location and identity of helical regions across the 20 lowest energy structures (Supplementary Figure <12a, b>). In most structures a 3–10 helix was identified for residues 315–318, although in the lowest energy structure residues 315–318 are in α-helical conformation (Supplementary Figure <12c>). The transfer-NOE data thus point to the formation of helical structure in Tau(292–319) upon binding to F-actin, but the number of detected restraints was not sufficient to define a unique conformation.To address the importance of having multiple helical regions separated by flexible linkers for binding to and bundling of F-actin, we used the peptide Tau(254–268). Tau(254–268) contains the residues, which form the helix in the N-terminal half of Tau(254–290) (Fig. <3c>), but not the C-terminal helical region (Fig. <3d>). Sequential resonance assignment of the peptide (Supplementary Table <3>), followed by NOE analysis (Supplementary Fig. <13>) and structure calculations (Supplementary Fig. <14>) showed that the short peptide folds into an α-helix (residues 259–265) in complex with F-actin that is similar to the one found in Tau(254–290) (Supplementary Fig. <14b>). In contrast to Tau(254–290), however, Tau(254–268) was not able to bundle F-actin (Supplementary Fig. <5d>). Thus, two Tau interaction sites have to be present, in order to bundle F-actin filaments. Tau protein is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, acetylation and several other modifications<26>, <50>–<52>. An important class of kinases that phosphorylate Tau at S262 and the other KXGS motifs in the repeat domain are the microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs)<53>–<55>. We therefore phosphorylated full-length Tau by MARK2. The downfield chemical shift of phosphorylated residues (Fig. <4a>) is in agreement with previous reports and confirms phosphorylation at S262, S293, S305, S324, S356, and S416<54>. Subsequently, 1H-15N HSQC spectra of MARK2-phosphorylated Tau were performed in the absence and presence of F-actin (Figs. <4b, c>). In contrast to the non-phosphorylated protein, little attenuation of NMR signals in vicinity of the phosphorylation sites was detected (Fig. <4b–d>). Residues such as S262 and S356 largely retained the NMR signal intensity in presence of F-actin (Fig. <4b>)."
PMC5719408_4,"However, residues in the proline-rich region, as well as V275-L284, which do not contain MARK2-phosphorylation sites, experienced similar F-actin induced signal attenuation when compared to non-phosphorylated Tau (Fig  <4d>). rhetorical Fig. 4 MARK2 phosphorylation decreases Tau’s affinity for F-actin. a

An important class of kinases that phosphorylate Tau at S262 and the other KXGS motifs in the repeat domain are the microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs)<53>–<55>. We therefore phosphorylated full-length Tau by MARK2. The downfield chemical shift of phosphorylated residues (Fig. <4a>) is in agreement with previous reports and confirms phosphorylation at S262, S293, S305, S324, S356, and S416<54>.

In contrast to the non-phosphorylated protein, little attenuation of NMR signals in vicinity of the phosphorylation sites was detected (Fig. <4b–d>). Residues such as S262 and S356 largely retained the NMR signal intensity in presence of F-actin (Fig. <4b>). However, residues in the proline-rich region, as well as V275-L284, which do not contain MARK2-phosphorylation sites, experienced similar F-actin induced signal attenuation when compared to non-phosphorylated Tau (Fig. <4d>). The NMR experiments demonstrate that MARK2-phosphorylation of Tau attenuates its binding to F-actin. Consistent with a reduced affinity, MARK2-phosphorylated Tau failed in bundling actin filaments (Fig. <4e>). In addition, attachment of a phosphate group to S262 in the peptide Tau(254–284) decreased the affinity of the peptide for F-actin (Supplementary Fig. <1>) and lowered the amount of Tau(254–284)-promoted actin bundles (Fig. <4f>). In the NMR-based docking model with F-actin, S262 might share a hydrogen bond with Y143 of actin (Fig. <3e>). Thus, phosphorylation within one of the seven interaction motifs of Tau (e.g. S262 in the helical segment formed by residues ~260 to ~268; Figs. <2> and <3c>) weakens the interaction of this motif with F-actin, in agreement with the structural studies (Fig. <3>). Tau and other microtubule-associated proteins, such as MAP2, not only bind to microtubules but also to filamentous actin, which results in cross-linking and bundling of actin filaments (Fig. <1a>)<3>–<10>. The interaction of Tau with actin is important for neurite outgrowth and synaptic dysfunction<11>, <12>, <22>. Pathogenic forms of Tau have been connected to the formation of actin-rich rods<56>, which were found to induce neurodegeneration in Drosophila neurons<22>. In addition, Tau-induced neurotoxicity is associated with increased F-actin levels<22>, and Tau-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton can cause plasma membrane blebbing<57>. In agreement with previous findings, we show that Tau binds with high-affinity to filamentous actin, resulting in F-actin bundling (Fig. <1b>). Both the proline-rich region and the microtubule-binding repeats contribute to the interaction (Figs. <1e, f>). Interaction with the proline-rich region is primarily of electrostatic nature<58>. In contrast, short hydrophobic residue stretches in the repeat domain (Supplementary Fig. <3a>) bind to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomain 1 and 3 of actin (Fig. <2>). This hydrophobic pocket is solvent-accessible on the surface of actin filaments<59>–<61>. The F-actin-interacting Tau residues are separated from each other by flexible linkers, which enable a high degree of dynamics and multivalency in the Tau/F-actin interaction.We further showed that the F-actin-interacting residues in the repeat domain of Tau, fold into short helices upon binding to filamentous actin (Fig. <3> and Supplementary Figs. <12> and <14>). Folding of local regions of Tau into helical structure is consistent with the formation of α-helices in actin-binding proteins, in which the actin-interacting region is intrinsically disordered prior to binding to actin<59>. The Tau regions that fold into helical structure include part of 275VQIINK280 (Fig. <3d>), a hexapeptide that is important for aberrant aggregation of Tau into paired helical filaments<62>. The hexapeptide populates extended structure in solution<27>, is found in cross-β structure in amyloid fibrils<63>, but folds into helical structure in complex with F-actin (Fig. <3d>). In addition, the N-terminal halves of each of Tau’s four 18-residue aminoacid repeats<64> bind to F-actin’s hydrophobic pocket and fold into helical structure (Fig. <3c>; Supplementary Figs. <12> and <14>). Consistent with the compatibility of these regions for helical conformation, Tau residues 253–260, 315–322, and 345–354 populate helical structure in the presence of detergent and upon binding to membranes<65>. Docking of experimentally determined Tau helices to the F-actin surface together with sequence alignment showed that the overall position of the interacting Tau and cofilin helices is well conserved, but the directionality of their polypeptide chain is inverted (Fig. <3e, f>). The directionality of the Tau(259–267)-helix is similar to that of the actin-interacting helix of toxofilin (Supplementary Fig. <9>), an actin-binding protein that is secreted into host cells during invasion<60>. Taken together the data show that Tau utilizes a structural mechanism for binding to F-actin that is used by actin-binding proteins.Binding of Tau and MAP2 to filamentous actin results in actin cross-linking and filament bundling<5>, <6>, <14>, <22>, <40>–<43>. At the same time, binding to F-actin can be retained, but the cross-linking activity disrupted. For example, a C-terminal fragment and a peptide corresponding to the second microtubule-binding repeat bind actin, but are incapable of mediating actin cross-linking<5>, <17>. These findings suggest that multiple domains of Tau might be required for actin cross-linking. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that a single Tau helix is sufficient for binding to F-actin, but at least two helices, which are separated by a flexible linker, are required for cross-linking activity (Supplementary Figs. <5>, <13> and <14>). On this basis, we developed a model, in which two helical regions in Tau are bound to two different actin filaments (Fig. <5a>). Because Tau contains seven actin-binding segments (Fig. <2e>), up to seven actin filaments could be linked together by a single Tau molecule. Steric constraints are minimized by the presence of flexible linkers between the seven actin-binding segments. In addition, the excess positive charge, which is present in the repeat domain of Tau, will decrease electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged filament surfaces. Because of the high sequence conservation in the repeat domain between Tau and other microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2c (Fig. <5b>), our data suggest that the described mechanism for actin cross-linking is more widely applicable. rhetorical Fig. 5 Model of Tau-driven actin bundling F-actin/microtubule network formation. a Schematic representation of cross-linking of actin filaments by helices of Tau, which are separated by flexible linkers.

On this basis, we developed a model, in which two helical regions in Tau are bound to two different actin filaments (Fig. <5a>). Because Tau contains seven actin-binding segments (Fig. <2e>), up to seven actin filaments could be linked together by a single Tau molecule. Steric constraints are minimized by the presence of flexible linkers between the seven actin-binding segments. In addition, the excess positive charge, which is present in the repeat domain of Tau, will decrease electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged filament surfaces. Because of the high sequence conservation in the repeat domain between Tau and other microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2c (Fig. <5b>), our data suggest that the described mechanism for actin cross-linking is more widely applicable. The interaction between actin filaments and microtubules is important for cellular processes including cell division, vesicle and organelle transport, axonal growth and migration<66>. Tau mediates interactions between microtubules and actin in neuronal growth cones, where Tau-mediated cytoskeletal interactions promote morphological changes. Moreover the tight connection between microtubules and actin drives the guided extension of axons during neuronal development as well as the formation and activity of synapses in mature neurons<67>. However the molecular mechanisms regulating this cytoskeletal crosstalk are poorly understood. Tau colocalizes with actin in differentiating PC12 cells<68>, N2a cells<69> and in the postsynaptic compartments of mature neurons<70>. Tau has also been found on dynamic microtubules in the actin rich growth cone areas of developing neurons<71>. These data support a role for Tau as regulator of microtubules and actin and suggests its potential role as linker between the both cytoskeletons. Consistent with these findings in cells, Tau binds in vitro simultaneously to microtubules and actin filaments<7>. We previously showed that the Tau residues 168–185, 224–237, 245–253, 269–284, 300–313, and 375–398 bind to microtubules at the interface between tubulin heterodimers (Fig. <5b>)<72>. Thus, when both F-actin and microtubules are present, they would compete for binding to residues 245–246, 275–284, and 305–313, while Tau residues 259–267, 289–297, and 320–330 will preferentially interact with F-actin (Fig. <5b>). Notably, the conformations that are induced in Tau upon binding to F-actin and microtubules are very different, because F-actin interaction is connected to helix formation (Fig. <3>), while short Tau regions fold into a hairpin-like structure in complex with microtubules<46>. Thus, the availability of multiple Tau sites for binding to microtubules and F-actin together with Tau residues, which are dedicated for binding to only F-actin or microtubules (Fig. <5b>), suggests a model in which microtubules and actin filaments are cross-linked by Tau in a multivalent, dynamic manner (Fig. <5c>), in agreement with experimentally observed cross-linking of microtubules and actin filaments by Tau<7>.Tau undergoes several post-translational modifications that influence its function, aggregation and toxicity<73>. An important post-translational modification is phosphorylation, because Tau is hyperphosphorylated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease<74>. Phosphorylation of serine residues at KXGS motifs in the repeat domain of Tau, such as S262, strongly reduce the affinity of Tau for microtubules<75>."
PMC5719408_6,"In addition, phosphorylation by endogenous protein kinases inhibits the ability of Tau and MAP2 to cross-link and bundle actin filaments<5>, <6>  Consistent with these data, we showed that phosphorylation of Tau by MARK2 reduces the affinity of Tau for F-actin (Fig. <4d>) and prevents F-actin bundling (Fig. <4e>). In addition, specific phosphorylation at S262 decreased the F-actin affinity of Tau(254–284) (Supplementary Fig. <1>) and decreased the peptides bundling activity (Fig. <4f>). The KXGS motif, which contains S262, is located in one of the F-actin interacting helices of Tau (Fig. <3c>). The side chain of S262 points towards actin’s hydrophobic binding pocket (Fig. <3e>), providing a structural explanation for the lower affinity of S262-phosphorylated Tau(254–284). While our as well as previous biophysical studies demonstrated that phosphorylation at the KXGS motifs decreases the affinity of Tau for both microtubules and F-actin, cellular studies showed that phosphorylation of the KXGS motifs cause MAP2 and Tau to localize to the actin cytoskeleton<9>. In addition, phosphorylated Tau is recruited to actin-cofilin rods, which might lead to neuropil threads<56>. Thus, phosphorylation of Tau at KXGS motifs fosters the interaction with actin-containing structures, but attenuates the direct interaction of Tau with microtubules and F-actin. Both findings together suggest that localization of phosphorylated Tau to actin-containing structures might be mediated by additional actin-binding proteins. Future studies should be targeted toward identification of these proteins. In addition to phosphorylation, acetylation of Tau at K281, a residues that is located in an F-actin interacting helix of Tau (Fig. <3d>), affects the interaction of Tau with actin and modulate Tau-mediated toxicity<26>.In summary, we provided insight into the interaction between actin filaments and microtubule-associated proteins and the crosstalk between the cytoskeletal networks formed by actin filaments and microtubules. We identified Tau residues that are important for complex formation and provided high-resolution information about the structural changes that occur in Tau upon binding to filamentous actin. We showed that Tau utilizes a structural mechanism for binding to actin filaments, which is used by many actin-binding proteins, but allows a highly dynamic and multivalent interaction with both actin filaments and microtubules. The multivalent interaction of Tau with F-actin and microtubules results in cross-linking of the cellular cytoskeleton. Our results also help in dissecting an important pathogenic mechanism in AD. Human Tau (2N4R) was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (MERCK Millipore) using the vector pNG2 as described<13>. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Mes, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM DTT, pH 6.8) and supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were disrupted using a French pressure cell and subsequently boiled for 20 min. The soluble extract was isolated by centrifugation and the supernatant was dialyzed twice against FPLC buffer (20 mM Mes, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, pH 6.8), and loaded onto a FPLC SP-Sepharose column. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of elution buffer (20 mM Mes, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, pH 6.8). Tau breakdown products were separated in a second chromatography step by using a Superdex G200 column (GE Healthcare) with the separation buffer (137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT). Protein samples uniformly enriched in 15N were prepared by growing E. coli bacteria in minimal medium containing 1 g l−1 of 15NH4Cl.Synthetic peptides were purchased from EZBiolab USA or synthesized in house on ABI 433A (Applied Biosystems) and Liberty 1 (CEM) machines. Peptides were synthesized with acetyl and amide protection groups at the N- and C terminus, respectively. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the pure product was lyophilized.Non-muscle human actin (catalog no. APHL99) as well as human cofilin (catalog no. CF01) were bought from Cytoskeleton, Inc. Hundred micrograms of cofilin powder were resuspended in 20 μl of distilled water to have a final buffer of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 5% sucrose and 1% dextran. The sample was then dialyzed against General Actin Buffer (GAB; 5 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT) or NMR buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 6.8, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% (v/v) D2O) to be used for electron microscopy or NMR experiments, respectively. In case of actin, lyophilized actin was reconstituted to 10 mg ml−1 by adding 100 μl of distilled water to be in the following buffer: GAB with 5% (w/v) sucrose and 1% (w/v) dextran. Subsequently, the sample was spun at 18,400 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was kept, and actin was polymerized by incubating 0.4 mg ml−1 G-actin in GAB and supplemented with polymerization buffer (1/10th the volume; 100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 500 mM KCl, 10 mM ATP) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g during 1 h at 4 °C. Filaments were collected at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube. The pellet was then resuspended in GAB or NMR Buffer as required.For labeling actin protein with MTSSL ((1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate, Toronto Research Chemicals), DTT was removed from the sample by using a 2 ml Zeba desalting column previously equilibrated with GAB at pH 6.8. Free sulfhydryl groups were then modified by incubating the sample overnight at 0 °C with a 20-fold molar excess of MTSSL. Unreacted MTSSL was removed with another 2 ml Zeba desalting column. Subsequently, MTSSL-labeled actin was polymerized as described above, in order to have MTSSL-labeled F-actin with the MTSSL molecule covalently bound to Cys374. NBD-conjugated actin from α-skeletal muscle was bought from Hypermol (Bielefeld, Germany). In this experiment, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-labeled G-actin was polymerized starting from 0.4 mg ml−1 of the conjugated actin supplemented with 10-fold excess of phalloidin (catalog no. P2141, Sigma-Aldrich) to provide stable filaments. Subsequently, 0.25 µM of labeled F-actin was incubated with increasing amounts of Tau or Tau fragments. The change of fluorescence intensity from NBD was followed in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Excitation and emission were set at 480 and 530 nm, respectively, and experiments were carried out at 25 °C in GAB. As reported by Hertzog, M. et al.<31> the normalized decrease in fluorescence (equation <1>) was analyzed and fitted by using equation <2>.1
2with Samples were bound to a glow discharged carbon foil covered copper grid. After washing of the grids using ddH2O, the samples were stained using 1% uranyl acetate. The samples were evaluated at room temperature using a CM 120 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, and The Netherlands) and a TemCam F416 CMOS camera (TVIPS, Gauting, Germany). Mixtures of F-actin with Tau (1:1) or Tau peptides (1:10 molar ratio) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. In case of the shorter peptide Tau(254–268), a 1:30 ratio was used. Centrifugation was performed in two steps. First, a spin rate of 5000 × g was used during 15 min to collect bundles of F-actin (PB) at the bottom of the tube. Secondly, the remaining sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g during 1 h collecting actin filaments (PF). The final supernatant (SN) was also kept for later usage. Pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of GAB. A volume of 25 μl of sample were taken for EM while the remaining 55 μl were loaded in a 4–20% gradient SDS gel, which was colored with Bromophenol Blue and denatured with SDS and heat. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance800 and 900 MHz NMR spectrometers at 278 K to reduce solvent exchange. 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra consisted of 64 scans, spectral windows of 12 ppm in the proton and 25 ppm in the nitrogen dimension."
PMC5719408_7,"2D NOESY experiments were acquired using 88 scans, 12 ppm spectral width and a time domain of 512 and 2048 points in the first and second dimension, respectively  To generate buildup curves, mixing times of 50, 80, 100, 150, and 250 ms were used.For HSQC-based competition experiments, 20 μM of 15N-labeled Tau were mixed with 30 μM F-actin in NMR buffer supplemented with 0.2 mM ATP and 0.2 mM CaCl2 (sample 2). Similarly 20 μM of 15N-labeled Tau was prepared in absence of F-actin as reference (sample 1). Finally, a 10-fold excess of cofilin, previously dialyzed in NMR buffer overnight, was added to sample 2. Competition was monitored by reading out the variation in signal broadening in 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Tau.For NOESY experiments, 27 μM of F-actin were mixed with 800 μM of Tau peptide in NMR buffer supplemented with 0.2 mM ATP and 0.2 mM CaCl2. A reference experiment was performed in similar conditions only with 800 μM peptide. For resonance assignment, a 2D TOCSY experiment with a mixing time of 75 ms was performed. All data were processed using NMRPipe<76> and analyzed using Sparky<77>. Distance restraints were obtained from cross-peaks observed in 2D 1H-1H NOESY spectra acquired with 100 ms mixing time. A total of 200 conformers were calculated using the standard simulated annealing schedule with 10,000 torsion angle dynamics steps per conformer using CYANA 3.97<78>. Subsequently, structures and distance restraints derived from CYANA were transformed to the XPLOR-NIH input file format. Final structures were refined in XPLOR-NIH using a restrained simulated annealing (SA) protocol<81> . During simulated annealing, the temperature was lowered from 500 K down to 100 K. To minimize the influence of calibration of NOE intensities, only medium-range NOE contacts were used with lower and upper limits set to 1.8 and 6.0 Å, respectively. Statistical knowledge-based potentials for 2D and 3D torsion angle correlations were implemented into the SA protocol and their non-dimensional force constant was ramped during the refinement from 0.002 to 10. A total of 400 structures were calculated and the 20 lowest-energy conformers were selected for analysis using the protein structure validation software suite (PSVS)<79>. Visualization was performed using PYMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC) and MOLMOL<80>. The same protocol for structure calculation and analysis was followed for all three peptides. Structures of Tau(254–268), Tau(254–290), and Tau(292–319), when bound to F-actin, were deposited in the ProteinDataBank (PDB id: 5NVB, 5N5A, and 5N5B). Additional relevant data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Microtubule-associated proteins regulate microtubule dynamics, bundle actin filaments, and cross-link actin filaments with microtubules. In addition, aberrant interaction of the microtubule-associated protein Tau with filamentous actin is connected to synaptic impairment in Alzheimer’s disease. Here we provide insight into the nature of interaction between Tau and actin filaments. We show that Tau uses several short helical segments to bind in a dynamic, multivalent process to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. Although a single Tau helix is sufficient to bind to filamentous actin, at least two, flexibly linked helices are required for actin bundling. In agreement with a structural model of Tau repeat sequences in complex with actin filaments, phosphorylation at serine 262 attenuates binding of Tau to filamentous actin. Taken together the data demonstrate that bundling of filamentous actin and cross-linking of the cellular cytoskeleton depend on the metamorphic and multivalent nature of microtubule-associated proteins. The microtubule associated protein Tau also interacts with filamentous actin. Here the authors combine biophysical experiments and NMR studies to characterize the structural changes that occur in Tau upon binding to filamentous actin and show that phosphorylation of serine 262 attenuates actin binding of Tau. ."
PMC5588676_0,"The pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by dystrophic neurites (DNs) surrounding extracellular Aβ-plaques, microgliosis, astrogliosis, intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. We have previously shown that inhibition of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) lowers Aβ production and tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that Aβ-overexpressing Tg PS1/APPsw, Tg APPsw mice, and tau overexpressing Tg Tau P301S mice exhibit a pathological activation of Syk compared to wild-type littermates. Syk activation is occurring in a subset of microglia and is age-dependently increased in Aβ-plaque-associated dystrophic neurites of Tg PS1/APPsw and Tg APPsw mice. In Tg Tau P301S mice, a pure model of tauopathy, activated Syk occurs in neurons that show an accumulation of misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, the tau pathology is exacerbated in neurons that display high levels of Syk activation supporting a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathological species in vivo. Importantly, human AD brain sections show both pathological Syk activation in DNs around Aβ deposits and in neurons immunopositive for pathological tau species recapitulating the data obtained in transgenic mouse models of AD. Additionally, we show that Syk overexpression leads to increased tau accumulation and promotes tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes in human neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, further supporting a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathogenic species. Collectively, our data show that Syk activation occurs following Aβ deposition and the formation of tau pathological species. Given that we have previously shown that Syk activation also promotes Aβ formation and tau hyperphosphorylation, our data suggest that AD pathological lesions may be self-propagating via a Syk dependent mechanism highlighting Syk as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. Funding for these studies was provided in part by the Department of Veterans Affairs VA Merit 1I01BX002572-(FC). We are thankful to the Roskamp Foundation for providing additional funding which helped to make this study possible. We are grateful to Dr. Peter Davies (Litwin-Zucker Center for Research on Alzheimer’s disease, Feinstein Institute, Manhasset, NY, USA) for kindly providing the PHF-1, CP13, DA9, RZ3 and MC1 antibodies. We are also thankful to Dr. Lester Binder (Department of Translational Science & Molecular Medicine, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, Grand Rapids, MI, USA) for providing the TOC1 antibody. Finally, we are grateful to Dr. Ann McKee (Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease and CTE Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA) for providing tissue sections from an AD patient and a non-demented control. The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that accounts for the majority of all cases of dementia. AD pathological hallmarks include extracellular aggregates of Aβ, intracellular tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, as well as neuroinflammation. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) involved in many essential cellular processes including stabilization of the microtubule network, thereby providing a functional basis for intracellular transport [<10>]. Misfolding and pathological post-translational modifications including tau hyperphosphorylation contribute to its oligomerization and accumulation that ultimately leads to neuronal death [<10>]. In addition, tau mutations that cause familial forms of dementia associated with the formation of tau aggregates have been identified suggesting that pathological tau species may play a key role in AD.Tau and Aβ have been proposed to synergistically contribute to the pathobiology of AD [<25>]. Through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by α, β and γ-secretases different variants of Aβ and soluble APP forms (α, β) are generated [<41>]. A variety of post-translational modifications and the nature of the Aβ variants define their susceptibility to aggregation and neurotoxicity [<41>, <42>]. Several mutations in the APP and presenilin (PSEN1/2) genes (members of the γ-secretase complex) have been identified and cause familial forms of AD (FAD) [<36>]. These mutations either render APP more susceptible to cleavage by the β-secretase (BACE-1) or the γ-secretase resulting in increased Aβ production or lead to the production of longer forms of Aβ that are more prone to aggregation and accumulation resulting in early onset AD (EOAD). In contrast, the etiology of sporadic or late onset AD (LOAD) accounts for more than 99% of all AD cases and remains unknown [<24>].Many studies have suggested the importance of neuroinflammation caused by Aβ in AD and that a therapeutic strategy can only be successful if it counteracts the neurotoxicity caused by inflammation [<24>, <29>]. Aβ fibrils have been shown to trigger an inflammatory response in primary microglial and monocytic cells via an activation of the tyrosine kinases Lyn (Lck/Yes novel tyrosine kinase) and Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) [<3>, <23>]. Importantly, Syk inhibition appears to prevent Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro [<3>]. A subsequent study also showed that Syk is the mediator of the Aβ-induced cytokine production including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) by activated microglia [<4>] suggesting that Syk is a key kinase responsible for the proinflammatory activity of Aβ.Many different sites of tau hyperphosphorylation have been identified in AD and various kinases have been the subject of investigations regarding their possible involvement in tau pathogenesis. Syk and Src family kinases have been shown to phosphorylate tau directly at Y18 [<20>, <25>]. Tau tyrosine phosphorylation is considered an early pathological change in AD [<5>, <20>]. Syk has also been shown to phosphorylate microtubules which could have an effect on microtubule polymerization or the interaction of signaling molecules with the microtubule network [<6>]. Moreover, pharmacological Syk inhibition has been found to stabilize microtubules through dephosphorylation of microtubules and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) [<44>].We have previously shown that Syk regulates the activation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), one of the main tau kinase that phosphorylates tau at multiple sites present in neurofibrillary tangles [<28>]. In addition, we have shown that Syk also regulates Aβ production and proposed that Syk could be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of AD as pharmacological inhibition of Syk appears to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ production both in vitro and in vivo [<28>].Syk is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) that mediates inflammatory responses [<8>]. PTKs like Syk are part of receptor-mediated signal transduction cascades that require their intracellular association with integral membrane receptors including toll-like receptors (TLRs [<11>]) and Fc receptors (FcγR [<14>], FcεRI [<21>]). Recruitment and activation of Syk is also mediated by activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) [<18>]. Interestingly, several variants of TREM2 are associated with an increased risk to develop AD and have been shown to alter AD pathology including Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation and synaptic loss in AD mouse models [<17>]. Syk becomes active through autophosphorylation and several Syk autophosphorylation sites have been identified in vitro: Y130, Y290, Y317, Y346, Y358, and Y525/526. The Y525/526 phosphorylation site is the main site involved in receptor-mediated Syk activation and signal propagation [<30>]. Although our previous work suggests that Syk could represent a therapeutic target for AD, the cellular localization and the activity pattern of Syk in the brains of transgenic mouse models of AD and AD pathological specimens remains to be determined."
PMC5588676_1,"We therefore investigated in this study whether Syk activation occurs in the brains of different mouse models of AD and in human AD brain by monitoring the Y525/526 Syk autophosphorylation site and analyzing its association with AD pathological hallmarks We investigated two different AD mouse models that overexpress APP and one mouse model of pure tauopathy that overexpresses human tau with the P301S mutation. In our study, we employed transgenic APPsw (Tg 2576) mice overexpressing the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL) of APP695 under the control of the hamster prion protein promoter [<13>]. These mice have elevated levels of Aβ and typically develop Aβ plaques at the age of 11 months [<15>]. We also analyzed transgenic PS1/APPsw mice which carry the APP KM670/671NL (Swedish) and the PSEN1 M146L mutations. In these mice, the human PSEN1 M146 L transgene is driven by the PDGF-β promoter. These double transgenic mice develop cortical and hippocampal amyloid deposits at 6 months of age; much earlier than the single transgenic APPsw (Tg2576). Additionally, the total Aβ burden is increased in these double transgenic mice compared to the single Tg 2576 transgenic mice [<12>]. Aβ deposits are associated with dystrophic neurites that occur at 12 months of age in Tg PS1/APPsw mice [<9>]. Furthermore, these mice display an increase in Aβ plaque-associated microglia and astrocytes at 6 months of age. However, increased microglial activity has been found to occur at 12 months [<9>]. In addition, we analyzed whether Syk activation occurs in the brain of transgenic Tau P301S PS19 mice that overexpress human tau with the P301S mutation. The P301S mutation in the tau gene on chromosome 17 has been associated with autosomal dominantly inherited frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism (FTDP-17) [<1>, <22>, <38>]. The expression of the P301S mutated tau is fivefold higher in Tg Tau P301S mice than the endogenous mouse protein and is driven by the mouse prion protein promoter [<43>]. Interestingly, these mice progressively develop neurodegeneration and display intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation that closely mimic neurofibrillary tangles.In this study, we show by high-resolution confocal microscopy that Syk activation is increased in a subset of activated microglia and in dystrophic neurites around Aβ plaques of Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice. Interestingly, pSyk is also age-dependently increased in neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice. The degree of colocalization between Syk and tau is largely dependent on the tau epitope investigated and differs between various phospho-tau epitopes and tau oligomers/conformers. The level of Syk activation, as measured by fluorescence intensity, correlates with the amount of pathological tau species detected. In addition, we show that Syk overexpression in human neuronal like cells (SH-SY5Y) results in increased total tau and tau phosphorylation levels at multiple epitopes. Taken together, our results show that β-amyloid and tau pathological species both activate Syk in vivo and conversely, that Syk is involved in microglial activation, plays a role in the pathogenesis of dystrophic neurites (DNs) and contributes to the formation of pathological tau species therefore exacerbating AD pathological lesions. Interestingly, human AD brain sections exhibit the same pattern of Syk activation as the mouse models of β-amyloidosis and tauopathy combined. Human AD brain sections show an increase in pSyk (phosphorylated Syk at Y525/526) levels in DNs around β − amyloid plaques and in neurons immunopositive for hyperphosphorylated tau (Y18) and pathological tau conformers (MC1), whereas brain sections from non-demented controls do not show any pSyk increase. Altogether, these data suggest a crucial role of Syk in the pathobiology of AD and highlight Syk as a promising therapeutic target in AD. Tg PS1/APPsw, Tg APPsw, Tg Tau P301S and wild-type mice were generated and maintained in a C57BL/6 genetic background as previously described [<28>]. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions in ventilated racks in the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) accredited vivarium of the Roskamp Institute. All experiments involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Roskamp Institute before implementation and were conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All mice were humanely euthanatized and their brains were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h. The method of euthanasia used follow the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. Briefly, mice were rendered unconscious through inhalation of 5% isoflurane in oxygen using a vaporizer and a gas chamber. While under anesthesia, after verifying the absence of reflexes, mice were euthanatized by exsanguination (blood was withdrawn from cardiac puncture).Subsequently, the hemispheres were processed in a Sakura Tissue-Tek VIP (Leica Biosystems Inc., IL, USA) vacuum infiltration processor. Brains were then embedded in paraffin with the Sakura Tissue-Tek (Leica Biosystems Inc., IL, USA) and stored at 4 °C for 2 days for subsequent cutting with a Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica Biosystems Inc., IL, USA). All brains were cut at a thickness of 12 μm. Sagittal slices were mounted on glass slides and dried for 48 h at 37 °C for subsequent immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging. Paraffin sections were washed in two baths of histoclear (National Diagnostics, USA) and progressively rehydrated with ethanol gradients and phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). Brain sections were subjected to antigen retrieval for 7 min in citric acid buffer (pH 6) at 100 °C. All sections were treated with 0.05% Sudan Black in 70% ethanol to quench autofluorescence. Sections were then blocked in PBS containing 10% donkey serum (Abcam, MA, USA) for 1 h. Sections were incubated in PBS containing 1% donkey serum and the respective panel of primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following antibodies were used: CP13 (anti(α)-phospho-tau (pTau) S202, 1:200, Dr. Peter Davies’ Lab), MC1 (α-conformational tau, 1:200, Dr. Peter Davies’ Lab), TOC1 (1:200, Dr. Lester Binder’s Lab), PHF-1 (α-pTau S396/404, 1:200, Dr. Peter Davies’ Lab), 9G3 (α-pTau Y18, 1:200, MediMabs Inc., QC, Canada), DA9 (α-total-tau (tTau), 1:200, Dr. Peter Davies’ Lab), α-BACE1 (1:200 Cell Signaling, MA, USA), α-sAPPβ with Swedish mutation (1:100 Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co, Ltd., Japan), α-Iba1 (1:300, Abcam, MA, USA), α-GFAP (1:5000, Aves Labs, OR, USA), α-pSyk (Y525/526, 1:200, Cell Signaling, MA, USA). In addition to the α-pSyk (Y525/526, 1:200, Cell Signaling, MA, USA), we used the α-pSyk (Y525/526, 1:100, Abgent, CA, USA) and obtained similar results. After three washing steps in PBS for 5 min, sections were incubated in a solution containing PBS, 1% donkey serum and the respective panel of secondary antibodies for 1 h in the dark at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The following secondary antibodies were used: donkey α-rabbit, α-goat, α-mouse conjugated to Alexa 488, 568 and 647, respectively (1:500, Life technologies). After three washing steps in PBS for 5 min, sections were mounted in Fluoroshield with or without DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). All images were acquired using the confocal microscope LSM 800 (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany), the ZEN Blue 2.1 (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) software and a 20× or 63× objective. The acquisition settings were kept the same for all genotypes within the same experiment.For qualitative analysis of the pSyk burden in Tg PS1/APPsw and Tg APPsw mice compared to age-matched WT littermates (n = 6 for each genotype, equal amount of male and female), 116 ± 13.5 (avg. ± SEM) weeks of age were stained and analyzed as described above (Fig. <1>). rhetorical Fig. 1 pSyk is increased in activated microglia and non-glial cells associated with Aβ-plaques in Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice."

For qualitative analysis of the pSyk burden in Tg Tau P301S mice compared to WT littermates, hippocampi and cortices of 16 male and female mice ranging from 8 to 56 weeks of age were stained and analyzed as described above.For the quantitative analysis of the pSyk burden (Fig. <3>), 140 randomly-selected microscopic fields of four non-consecutive brain slices (containing the hippocampus) from six animals per genotype (equal number of male and female) were acquired. The area covered with the pSyk immunopositive staining was quantified with Fiji [<34>] in microscopic fields containing Aβ plaques as well as in microscopic fields not containing Aβ deposits. The PS1/APPsw, APPsw and WT mice of the younger cohort were on average 45 ± 0.3 (avg. ± SEM) weeks old. The average age of the mice of the older cohort was 116 ± 13.5 weeks (±SEM). The pSyk burden of the transgenic mice was normalized to the level of pSyk burden quantified in wild-type littermates of the respective age-group. As a negative control, primary antibodies were omitted to determine background and autofluorescence (not shown).For the quantitative analysis of the colocalization of pSyk and different tau epitopes (Fig. <8>) between 400 and 570 cortical fields (50,000 μm2 per field) from four male Tg Tau P301S animals (average age 47 ± 3.1 (SEM) weeks) were analyzed for each tau epitope. To quantify the percentage of the immunopositive neurons a total of 2546 microscopic fields and 21,800 neurons were counted using the Zen Blue 2.1 software (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany).The fluorescence intensities (Figs. <9>, <10>, <11>, <12> and <13>) of 30 to 40 neurons immunopositive for pSyk, pTau or both (colocalized) were determined for each tau epitope (total of 90 neurons per epitope) using Zen Blue 2.1 (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). The male Tg Tau P301S mice (n = 4) used for quantification were on average 47 ± 3.1 weeks old (avg. ± SEM).In addition, the different immunostainings mentioned above were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections (10 μm, dorsolateral frontal cortex) from a 67-year-old, male patient with AD (Braak VI) and a 102-year-old, male non-demented control that were provided by Dr. Ann McKee (Boston University, MA, USA). Institutional review board approval for brain donation was obtained through the Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Center (BUADC, Boston, MA, USA). SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (VA, USA). SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), GlutaMAX and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone. A human cDNA ORF Clone of the human SYK gene (NM_003177, transcript variant 1) was purchased from OriGene Technologies (MD, USA). The cDNA fragment encoding human SYK was amplified by PCR using PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent Genomics, CA, USA) and subcloned into the p3xFLAG-Myc-CMV™-26 Expression Vector (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) to generate the pCMV-SYK-Flag plasmid. The entire reading frame of the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in advanced DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For stable transfection, SH-SY5Y cells were grown in 6-wells cell culture plates until reaching 70-80% confluence and transfected with 3 μg of empty pCMV vector (control cells) or pCMV-SYK-Flag plasmids per well using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). After 48 h, the medium surrounding transfected cells was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.2 mg/ml of G418 for selection. After 14 days of selection, G418 resistant cells were trypsinized and expanded. The expression efficiency of SYK was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against SYK (4D10 Syk antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA) and the Flag tag (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 24-well-plates for 24 h and subsequently lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent (MPER, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) containing Halt protease & phosphatase single use inhibitor/EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and 1 mM PMSF. Proteins of cell lysates were separated by 10% tris-glycine-SDS-PAGE using 1 mm Criterion TGX gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) and electro-transferred onto 0.2 μm PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked in TBS containing 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 h and were hybridized with the primary antibody (αSyk (4D10, 1:1000, Santa Cruz, TX, USA), αpTau S396/404 (PHF-1, 1:1000, Dr. Peter Davies’ Lab), αtTau (DA9, 1:1000, Dr. Peter Davies’ Lab), αpTau Y18 (9G3, 1:1000, MediMabs Inc., QC, Canada,) overnight at 4 °C."
PMC5588676_3,"Subsequently, the membranes were incubated for 1 h in HRP-conjugated αmouse secondary antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling, MA, USA)  Western blots were visualized using chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto Maxium Sensitity Substrate, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Signals were quantified using ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) and densitometric analyses were performed using Quantity One (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) image analysis software. The data were analyzed and plotted with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was used to test for Gaussian distribution. Statistical significance was determined by either Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test or the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test. All data are presented as mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM) and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To investigate whether pathological Syk activation occurs in the brain of AD mouse models, we analyzed the brains of 116-week-old wild-type, Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice using high-resolution confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence. All transgenic mice (Fig. <1b>-<e>) exhibit an increased Iba-1 and GFAP reactivity compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. <1a>). Moreover,wild-type some of the activated amoeboid microglia that are observed in transgenic mice are also strongly positive for pSyk (Fig. <1b>-<d>). By contrast, we did not detect any pSyk immunoreactivity in astrocytes (Fig. <1>). In addition, we observed that pSyk immunoreactivity is upregulated near Aβ plaques but neither colocalizes with microglia nor astrocytes suggesting that it could be of neuronal origin. (Fig. <1e>). We further investigated the cellular origin of these pSyk accumulations by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy (Fig. <2>). rhetorical Fig. 2 pSyk is increased in dystrophic neurites of Aβ-overexpressing mice.

The scale bars represent 10 μm To investigate whether pathological Syk activation occurs in the brain of AD mouse models, we analyzed the brains of 116-week-old wild-type, Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice using high-resolution confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence.

We further investigated the cellular origin of these pSyk accumulations by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy (Fig. <2>). To further characterize the cellular origin of pSyk accumulations near Aβ plaques, we tested different markers of dystrophic neurites (BACE-1 and sAPPβ) [<31>] and found a strong colocalization between pSyk and sAPPβ (Fig. <2a>) associated with Aβ deposits. The sAPPβ staining clearly reveals dystrophic swellings of neurites (Fig. <2a>) which are a known hallmark of AD. Most of the dystrophic neurites are positive for pSyk (Fig. <2a>). Additionally, we found a strong colocalization between sAPPβ and BACE-1 (Fig. <2b>) which are often used as markers of dystrophic neurites. Both sAPPβ and BACE-1 exhibit circular accumulations near Aβ plaques (Fig. <2b>), highly reminiscent of the pattern observed for activated Syk.In conclusion, activated Syk is not only found in microglia but also in neurons near Aβ deposits, particularly in dystrophic neurites of Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice supporting a possible role of Syk activation in the formation of dystrophic neurites. Dystrophic neurites are characterized by an accumulation of BACE-1 and sAPPβ [<31>] and our previous work [<28>] has shown that Syk regulates BACE-1 expression and sAPPβ levels suggesting that Syk upregulation in dystrophic neurites could contribute to the accumulation of BACE-1 and sAPPβ. We also quantified the pSyk burden observed in the cortex of Tg APPsw, Tg PS1/APPsw and wild-type (WT) littermates (Figs. <1> and <2>). Two different age-groups were investigated: younger animals, 45 weeks of age and older animals 116 weeks of age in average. In 45-week-old Tg APPsw mice, we did not observe significant β-amyloidosis (only three Aβ plaques were found in the cohort of mice analyzed) (data not shown) showing that, at that age, the Aβ pathology is almost inexistent in these mice. We differentiated between microscopic fields containing Aβ deposits and microscopic fields not containing Aβ deposits for the quantification of the pSyk burden in Tg PS1/APPsw and older Tg APPsw mice. 45-week-old Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice do not show any significant difference in pSyk burden in fields without Aβ deposits compared to WT mice. The pSyk burden of 45-week-old Tg APPsw mice is identical to that of the WT mice (100 ± 6.76% compared to 80.85 ± 11.77%; Fig. <3a>). The pSyk burden in fields not containing Aβ plaques in Tg PS1/APPsw mice is not statistically significantly elevated (153.48 ± 18.47%), compared to the WT littermates. As expected, 45-week-old Tg PS1/APPsw mice exhibited a significantly higher pSyk burden in fields containing Aβ plaques (410.19 ± 46.46%) compared to WT and Tg APPsw mice. rhetorical Fig. 3 Cortical pSyk burden is age-dependently increased in Aβ-overexpressing mice, particularly in microscopic fields containing Aβ deposits, compared to wild-type littermates. Cortical pSyk burden (area covered) of immunofluorescence images (Fig. <1>) was quantified in 45 ± 0.3-week-old (avg. ± SEM) (a) and 116 ± 13.5-week-old (avg. ± SEM) (b) Tg APPsw (n = 6) and Tg PS1/APPsw mice (n = 6), compared and normalized to wild-type littermates (n = 6). Microscopic fields containing Aβ deposits were distinguished from microscopic fields not containing Aβ deposits as described in the materials and methods section. Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test revealed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in pSyk in fields containing Aβ deposits in younger Tg PS1/APPsw animals compared to age-matched wild-type littermates (a). pSyk burden in older Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw mice was statistically significantly increased in cortical microscopic fields containing Aβ deposits compared to age-matched wild-type littermates (p < 0.001). Older Tg PS1/APPsw mice also exhibited a statistically significant pSyk burden increase in microscopic fields not containing Aβ deposits (p < 0.001), whereas the pSyk burden in Tg APPsw in microscopic fields not containing Aβ deposits was not statistically different from wild-type littermates (P > 0.05). Six animals per genotype were analyzed. Error bars represent SEM We also quantified the pSyk burden observed in the cortex of Tg APPsw, Tg PS1/APPsw and wild-type (WT) littermates (Figs. <1> and <2>). Two different age-groups were investigated: younger animals, 45 weeks of age and older animals 116 weeks of age in average.

The analysis of the pSyk burden in the cortex of older animals (average age: 116 weeks) revealed large differences between genotypes. The pSyk burden of Tg APPsw (216.32 ± 45.23%) mice in microscopic fields without plaques is not significantly increased compared to WT mice (100 ± 7.78%) (Fig. <3b>). In contrast, microscopic fields of older Tg APPsw mice containing Aβ deposits exhibit a strong increase in pSyk burden (799.95 ± 130.19%) compared to age-matched WT mice. Tg PS1/APPsw mice also exhibit a statistically significant increase in pSyk burden in microscopic fields that do not contain Aβ deposits (458.1 ± 109.68) compared to age-matched WT controls. In addition, a much greater pSyk burden is found in Tg PS1/APPsw in microscopic fields containing Aβ deposits. In these fields, the pSyk burden is increased by 1157.31 ± 129.68% compared to WT littermates (Fig. <3b>).In conclusion, our data show that the pSyk burden is highly associated with Aβ plaques and increases with age in Tg PS1/APPsw and Tg APPsw mice whereas no activation of Syk is observed in the brain of WT littermates. The upregulation of Syk activation observed in the brains of Tg APPsw and Tg PS1/APPsw is mainly attributable to pSyk accumulations in dystrophic neurites that are associated with Aβ plaques and increase with age and Aβ burden. Having shown that Aβ-overexpressing mouse models of AD exhibit an increased Syk activation in microglia and dystrophic neurites, we investigated whether Syk activation also occurs in Tg Tau P301S mice (a pure model of tauopathy) using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.

Interestingly, the onset of abnormal Syk activation occurs earlier (16 weeks of age) in the cortex than in the hippocampus (Fig. <7b> compared to Fig. <6d>). In conclusion, both pSyk and tau pathology in Tg Tau P301S mice increase with age but the progression is different in the hippocampus and the cortex. Many cortical neurons exhibit a colocalization of pSyk and pTau (S202) (Fig. <7b>-<c>, <e>) but as mentioned earlier, there are also neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk or pTau.We further quantified the number of neurons that are singly pSyk immunopositive, singly immunopositive for tau pathogenic species and neurons immunopositive for both pSyk and tau pathogenic species in the cortex of 47-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <8>). We calculated the percentages of neurons singly immunopositive for either pSyk, pathogenic tau species or neurons immunopositive for both. The sum of all cortical neurons counted was considered 100% including neurons positive for pSyk and the respective tau epitope and neurons immunopositive for both. For all the tau epitopes tested, we found that only a small fraction of the neurons is singly immunopositive for pSyk (9.7 ± 4.4% (pTau, Y18); 2.5 ± 1.2% (pTau, S202); 9.2 ± 1.6% (MC1 pathogenic tau conformers); 9.6 ± 6.3% (pTau, S396/404); 4.8 ± 2.0% (TOC1 (tau oligomers)). Interestingly, a larger percentage of neurons is immunoreactive for both pSyk and tau pathogenic species (44.7 ± 8.6% (MC1); 39.7 ± 12.4% pTau Y18; 22.5 ± 18.6% (PHF-1, pTau S396/404); 12.4 ± 8.1% (TOC1, tau oligomers) but only 5.7 ± 2.2% for pTau (S202)). The neurons singly immunopositive for tau complement these observations with relative values of 46.1 ± 8.2% (MC1), 50.6 ± 16.3% (Y18), 67.9 ± 24.9% (S396/404), 82.8 ± 10.1% (TOC1), and 91.8 ± 3.2% (S202) (Fig. <8>). The differences in relative colocalization between pSyk and specific tau pathologic species suggest that specific pathogenic forms of tau may have a different impact on Syk activation or either that Syk activation may contribute to the formation of specific tau pathogenic species (Fig. <8>)."
PMC5588676_6,"We therefore subsequently measured the fluorescent intensities of pSyk and of the different tau epitopes to determine whether the level of Syk activation correlates with the amount of specific tau pathogenic species  In general, we found that neurons that exhibit a high level of pSyk immunoreactivity also demonstrate a higher level of tau pathogenic species whereas neurons that are weakly immunopositive for pSyk show less tau pathology (Figs. <9>, <10>, <11>, <12> and <13>). In addition, neurons that are singly immunopositive for tau pathogenic species (including hyperphosphorylated tau and misfolded tau) show also less intense tau pathologies, as measured by fluorescent intensities, than neurons that are displaying both pSyk and tau pathology, further supporting a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathogenic species. For instance, the level of pathogenic tau conformers (MC1) is significantly increased in neurons that are also strongly immunopositive for pSyk compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for MC1 (Fig. <9d>, p < 0.05). Interestingly, the level of pSyk is also significantly increased in neurons that display an accumulation of MC1 pathogenic conformers compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk (Fig. <9e>, p < 0.01). These data suggest that pathogenic tau conformers and Syk activation may promote each other. We found that tau phosphorylation at Y18 is significantly increased in neurons that are also immunopositive for pSyk (Fig. <10d>, p < 0.05) which is consistent with previous data showing that in vitro Syk can phosphorylates tau at Y18. We have previously shown that Syk positively regulates GSK-3β activity in vitro. It is therefore consistent with our observation that the GSK-3β-dependent phospho-tau epitope (S396/404, PHF-1) is also increased in neurons that display Syk activation (Fig. <11d>, p < 0.0001). The pSyk level, however, is not statistically significantly increased in neurons that are immunopositive for both PHF-1 and pSyk compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk suggesting that PHF-1 phosphorylated tau species do not induce Syk activation (Fig. <11e>). Similar observations were obtained for tau oligomers (Fig. <12>, TOC1) and tau species phosphorylated at S202 (Fig. <13>, CP13). Altogether, these data suggest that only certain pathogenic forms of tau (MC1, Y18) promote Syk activation, whereas Syk activation appears to directly induce tau phosphorylation at Y18 and to indirectly regulate tau phosphorylation at multiple epitopes (S396/404, S202) as well as tau misfolding (MC1, TOC1). rhetorical Fig. 8 The degree of colocalization of pSyk and tau differs for various tau epitopes. Sections from Tg Tau P301S mice (n = 4, 47 ± 3.1-week-old) were stained with antibodies against pTau (S202, S396/404, Y18), tau oligomers (TOC1) or tau conformers (MC1) and pSyk (Y525/526, green). The cortices were divided in ROIs (each at a size of 50,000μm2) and neurons singly immunopositive for pSyk, singly immunoreactive for the respective tau epitope and the neurons immunopositive for both pSyk and the respective tau epitope (colocalized) were counted and the percentages of each neuronal fraction calculated using Zen Blue 2.1 (Zeiss) and Excel (MS Office), respectively. In average, 509 cortical fields were analyzed for each epitope (total of 21,800 neurons counted). The percentage of neurons singly immunopositive for pSyk was at a similar level for all tau epitopes investigated (pSyk only). MC1 and pTau Y18 show the highest colocalization with pSyk whereas the incidence of neurons immunopositive for both pSyk and TOC1 or pTau S202 was much lower (colocalized fraction). The error bars represent SEM Having shown that Aβ-overexpressing mouse models of AD exhibit an increased Syk activation in microglia and dystrophic neurites, we investigated whether Syk activation also occurs in Tg Tau P301S mice (a pure model of tauopathy) using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Hippocampal neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice exhibit a high level of tau hyperphosphorylation (Fig. <4b>) as well as an accumulation of pathogenic tau conformers (MC1, not shown) compared to WT littermates (Fig. <4a>). Most importantly, pathological tau species clearly colocalize with pSyk (Y525/526) in hippocampal neurons (Fig. <4b>). The pSyk burden is particularly prominent in hippocampal neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <4b>) whereas WT littermates do not exhibit any pSyk immunoreactivity in the hippocampus (Fig. <4a>). Cortical neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice also exhibit an increased level of tau hyperphosphorylation (Fig. <5b>) compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. <5a>). We observed a colocalization between pSyk and pTau (S202) immunoreactivities in cortical neurons. Interestingly, we also observed neurons that are singly immunopositive for tau or for pSyk. We addressed this observation by performing additional analyses (Figs. <8>, <9>, <10>, <11>, <12>, <13>, <14> and <15>). We also analyzed the temporal changes of pSyk and tau levels in hippocampi and cortices of Tg Tau P301S mice between the age of 8 and 56 weeks (Figs. <6> and <7>). WT mice do not exhibit any detectable tau phosphorylation (Fig. <6f>) or tau oligomerization at any age (not shown). We then focused on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and found an age-dependent increase of tau phosphorylation (Fig. <6>, S202, left panels) in Tg Tau P301S mice. Tau phosphorylation at S202 in the dentate gyrus was already detectable in 8-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice, however, pSyk immunoreactivity was not observed. Neurons immunopositive for pSyk (Y525/526) and pTau (S202) or tau conformers (MC1, not shown) were observed in the dentate gyrus of 42-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <6d>). The neuronal pSyk burden also increases with age in Tg Tau P301S mice and is mainly restricted to the neuronal cell body (Fig. <6>). Interestingly, microglia and neurites did not exhibit activated Syk in the hippocampus of Tau P301S mice (Fig. <6>). Abnormal Syk activation seems to follow tau hyperphosphorylation (S202) in the hippocampus of Tg P301S mice (Fig. <6>), as well as the formation of MC1-tau pathological conformers (data not shown here but MC1 and pSyk colocalization were quantified below). Cortical neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice also show an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation and pSyk with age (Fig. <7>). Interestingly, the onset of abnormal Syk activation occurs earlier (16 weeks of age) in the cortex than in the hippocampus (Fig. <7b> compared to Fig. <6d>). In conclusion, both pSyk and tau pathology in Tg Tau P301S mice increase with age but the progression is different in the hippocampus and the cortex. Many cortical neurons exhibit a colocalization of pSyk and pTau (S202) (Fig. <7b>-<c>, <e>) but as mentioned earlier, there are also neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk or pTau.We further quantified the number of neurons that are singly pSyk immunopositive, singly immunopositive for tau pathogenic species and neurons immunopositive for both pSyk and tau pathogenic species in the cortex of 47-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <8>). We calculated the percentages of neurons singly immunopositive for either pSyk, pathogenic tau species or neurons immunopositive for both. The sum of all cortical neurons counted was considered 100% including neurons positive for pSyk and the respective tau epitope and neurons immunopositive for both. For all the tau epitopes tested, we found that only a small fraction of the neurons is singly immunopositive for pSyk (9.7 ± 4.4% (pTau, Y18); 2.5 ± 1.2% (pTau, S202); 9.2 ± 1.6% (MC1 pathogenic tau conformers); 9.6 ± 6.3% (pTau, S396/404); 4.8 ± 2.0% (TOC1 (tau oligomers)). Interestingly, a larger percentage of neurons is immunoreactive for both pSyk and tau pathogenic species (44.7 ± 8.6% (MC1); 39.7 ± 12.4% pTau Y18; 22.5 ± 18.6% (PHF-1, pTau S396/404); 12.4 ± 8.1% (TOC1, tau oligomers) but only 5.7 ± 2.2% for pTau (S202)).

Altogether, these data suggest that only certain pathogenic forms of tau (MC1, Y18) promote Syk activation, whereas Syk activation appears to directly induce tau phosphorylation at Y18 and to indirectly regulate tau phosphorylation at multiple epitopes (S396/404, S202) as well as tau misfolding (MC1, TOC1). rhetorical Fig. 11 Syk activation (pSyk (Y525/526) influences the level of tau phosphorylation at S396/404. Sections from Tg Tau P301S (n = 4, 47 ± 3.1-week-old) were stained with antibodies against phosphorylated tau (S396/404, purple) and pSyk (Y525/526, green). Fluorescent intensities of pTau (pS396/404) and pSyk were measured using Zen Blue 2.1 (Zeiss). Three different neuronal fractions were differentiated: a neurons singly immunopositive for pS396/404 tau, (b) neurons singly immunopositive for pSyk and (c) neurons immunopositive for both (colocalized). d Fluorescent intensities of pS396/404 tau were compared between neurons singly immunopositive for pS396/404 (purple) and the neurons exhibiting a colocalization of pS396/404 and pSyk (purple-green-striped). Two-tailed Mann–Whitney test revealed a significant increase (p < 0.0001) of pS396/404 fluorescent intensity in the neurons exhibiting a colocalization compared to neurons singly immunopositive for pS396/404 tau. e Fluorescent intensities of pSyk were compared between singly pSyk immunopositive neurons (green) and neurons exhibiting a colocalization of pSyk and pS396/404 tau (purple-green-striped). Two-tailed Mann–Whitney test revealed no significant change of pSyk fluorescent intensity in neurons exhibiting a colocalization compared to singly pSyk immunopositive neurons. The scale bar represents 10 μm. The error bars represent SEM Having shown that Aβ-overexpressing mouse models of AD exhibit an increased Syk activation in microglia and dystrophic neurites, we investigated whether Syk activation also occurs in Tg Tau P301S mice (a pure model of tauopathy) using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Hippocampal neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice exhibit a high level of tau hyperphosphorylation (Fig. <4b>) as well as an accumulation of pathogenic tau conformers (MC1, not shown) compared to WT littermates (Fig. <4a>). Most importantly, pathological tau species clearly colocalize with pSyk (Y525/526) in hippocampal neurons (Fig. <4b>). The pSyk burden is particularly prominent in hippocampal neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <4b>) whereas WT littermates do not exhibit any pSyk immunoreactivity in the hippocampus (Fig. <4a>). Cortical neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice also exhibit an increased level of tau hyperphosphorylation (Fig. <5b>) compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. <5a>). We observed a colocalization between pSyk and pTau (S202) immunoreactivities in cortical neurons. Interestingly, we also observed neurons that are singly immunopositive for tau or for pSyk. We addressed this observation by performing additional analyses (Figs. <8>, <9>, <10>, <11>, <12>, <13>, <14> and <15>). We also analyzed the temporal changes of pSyk and tau levels in hippocampi and cortices of Tg Tau P301S mice between the age of 8 and 56 weeks (Figs. <6> and <7>). WT mice do not exhibit any detectable tau phosphorylation (Fig. <6f>) or tau oligomerization at any age (not shown). We then focused on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and found an age-dependent increase of tau phosphorylation (Fig. <6>, S202, left panels) in Tg Tau P301S mice. Tau phosphorylation at S202 in the dentate gyrus was already detectable in 8-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice, however, pSyk immunoreactivity was not observed. Neurons immunopositive for pSyk (Y525/526) and pTau (S202) or tau conformers (MC1, not shown) were observed in the dentate gyrus of 42-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <6d>). The neuronal pSyk burden also increases with age in Tg Tau P301S mice and is mainly restricted to the neuronal cell body (Fig. <6>). Interestingly, microglia and neurites did not exhibit activated Syk in the hippocampus of Tau P301S mice (Fig. <6>). Abnormal Syk activation seems to follow tau hyperphosphorylation (S202) in the hippocampus of Tg P301S mice (Fig. <6>), as well as the formation of MC1-tau pathological conformers (data not shown here but MC1 and pSyk colocalization were quantified below)."
PMC5588676_10,"Cortical neurons of Tg Tau P301S mice also show an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation and pSyk with age (Fig  <7>). Interestingly, the onset of abnormal Syk activation occurs earlier (16 weeks of age) in the cortex than in the hippocampus (Fig. <7b> compared to Fig. <6d>). In conclusion, both pSyk and tau pathology in Tg Tau P301S mice increase with age but the progression is different in the hippocampus and the cortex. Many cortical neurons exhibit a colocalization of pSyk and pTau (S202) (Fig. <7b>-<c>, <e>) but as mentioned earlier, there are also neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk or pTau.We further quantified the number of neurons that are singly pSyk immunopositive, singly immunopositive for tau pathogenic species and neurons immunopositive for both pSyk and tau pathogenic species in the cortex of 47-week-old Tg Tau P301S mice (Fig. <8>). We calculated the percentages of neurons singly immunopositive for either pSyk, pathogenic tau species or neurons immunopositive for both. The sum of all cortical neurons counted was considered 100% including neurons positive for pSyk and the respective tau epitope and neurons immunopositive for both. For all the tau epitopes tested, we found that only a small fraction of the neurons is singly immunopositive for pSyk (9.7 ± 4.4% (pTau, Y18); 2.5 ± 1.2% (pTau, S202); 9.2 ± 1.6% (MC1 pathogenic tau conformers); 9.6 ± 6.3% (pTau, S396/404); 4.8 ± 2.0% (TOC1 (tau oligomers)). Interestingly, a larger percentage of neurons is immunoreactive for both pSyk and tau pathogenic species (44.7 ± 8.6% (MC1); 39.7 ± 12.4% pTau Y18; 22.5 ± 18.6% (PHF-1, pTau S396/404); 12.4 ± 8.1% (TOC1, tau oligomers) but only 5.7 ± 2.2% for pTau (S202)). The neurons singly immunopositive for tau complement these observations with relative values of 46.1 ± 8.2% (MC1), 50.6 ± 16.3% (Y18), 67.9 ± 24.9% (S396/404), 82.8 ± 10.1% (TOC1), and 91.8 ± 3.2% (S202) (Fig. <8>). The differences in relative colocalization between pSyk and specific tau pathologic species suggest that specific pathogenic forms of tau may have a different impact on Syk activation or either that Syk activation may contribute to the formation of specific tau pathogenic species (Fig. <8>). We therefore subsequently measured the fluorescent intensities of pSyk and of the different tau epitopes to determine whether the level of Syk activation correlates with the amount of specific tau pathogenic species. In general, we found that neurons that exhibit a high level of pSyk immunoreactivity also demonstrate a higher level of tau pathogenic species whereas neurons that are weakly immunopositive for pSyk show less tau pathology (Figs. <9>, <10>, <11>, <12> and <13>). In addition, neurons that are singly immunopositive for tau pathogenic species (including hyperphosphorylated tau and misfolded tau) show also less intense tau pathologies, as measured by fluorescent intensities, than neurons that are displaying both pSyk and tau pathology, further supporting a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathogenic species. For instance, the level of pathogenic tau conformers (MC1) is significantly increased in neurons that are also strongly immunopositive for pSyk compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for MC1 (Fig. <9d>, p < 0.05). Interestingly, the level of pSyk is also significantly increased in neurons that display an accumulation of MC1 pathogenic conformers compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk (Fig. <9e>, p < 0.01). These data suggest that pathogenic tau conformers and Syk activation may promote each other. We found that tau phosphorylation at Y18 is significantly increased in neurons that are also immunopositive for pSyk (Fig. <10d>, p < 0.05) which is consistent with previous data showing that in vitro Syk can phosphorylates tau at Y18. We have previously shown that Syk positively regulates GSK-3β activity in vitro. It is therefore consistent with our observation that the GSK-3β-dependent phospho-tau epitope (S396/404, PHF-1) is also increased in neurons that display Syk activation (Fig. <11d>, p < 0.0001). The pSyk level, however, is not statistically significantly increased in neurons that are immunopositive for both PHF-1 and pSyk compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk suggesting that PHF-1 phosphorylated tau species do not induce Syk activation (Fig. <11e>).

Interestingly, the level of pSyk is also significantly increased in neurons that display an accumulation of MC1 pathogenic conformers compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk (Fig. <9e>, p < 0.01).

It is therefore consistent with our observation that the GSK-3β-dependent phospho-tau epitope (S396/404, PHF-1) is also increased in neurons that display Syk activation (Fig. <11d>, p < 0.0001). The pSyk level, however, is not statistically significantly increased in neurons that are immunopositive for both PHF-1 and pSyk compared to neurons that are singly immunopositive for pSyk suggesting that PHF-1 phosphorylated tau species do not induce Syk activation (Fig. <11e>). Similar observations were obtained for tau oligomers (Fig. <12>, TOC1) and tau species phosphorylated at S202 (Fig. <13>, CP13). Altogether, these data suggest that only certain pathogenic forms of tau (MC1, Y18) promote Syk activation, whereas Syk activation appears to directly induce tau phosphorylation at Y18 and to indirectly regulate tau phosphorylation at multiple epitopes (S396/404, S202) as well as tau misfolding (MC1, TOC1). To further investigate the impact of Syk on tau, we generated human neuronal-like (SH-SY5Y) cells overexpressing Syk (Syk-OX). Syk-OX SH-SY5Y cells show an approximate 17-fold increase in Syk expression compared to control SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. <14b>, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, Syk upregulation in SH-SY5Y cells leads to a significant increase (1.7-fold) in phosphorylated tau at Y18 (Fig. <14c>, p < 0.01) and at S396/404 (Fig. <14d>, 3-fold, p < 0.0001) compared to control cells. Total tau levels are also significantly increased following Syk overexpression (Fig. <14e>, 4.2-fold, p < 0.0001). We analyzed the possible impact of Syk overexpression on Tau mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR and found that Syk overexpression does not affect Tau transcription (data not shown) suggesting that Syk may regulate tau degradation or tau protein translation. In summary, these results show that the accumulation of tau pathogenic species can trigger Syk activation, as shown in Tg Tau P301S mice (Figs. <8>, <9>, <10>, <11>, <12> and <13>), whereas Syk itself appears to regulate total tau levels and tau phosphorylation at multiple epitopes (Fig. <14>) therefore influencing the development of the tau pathology. rhetorical Fig. 14 Syk overexpression increases tau phosphorylation and total tau levels in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with either the empty plasmid as a control or with the same plasmid carrying the Syk sequence for overexpression (Syk OX).

Western-blots chemiluminescent signals were quantified and results were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

The error bars represent SEM To further investigate the impact of Syk on tau, we generated human neuronal-like (SH-SY5Y) cells overexpressing Syk (Syk-OX). Syk-OX SH-SY5Y cells show an approximate 17-fold increase in Syk expression compared to control SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. <14b>, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, Syk upregulation in SH-SY5Y cells leads to a significant increase (1.7-fold) in phosphorylated tau at Y18 (Fig. <14c>, p < 0.01) and at S396/404 (Fig. <14d>, 3-fold, p < 0.0001) compared to control cells. Total tau levels are also significantly increased following Syk overexpression (Fig. <14e>, 4.2-fold, p < 0.0001). We analyzed the possible impact of Syk overexpression on Tau mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR and found that Syk overexpression does not affect Tau transcription (data not shown) suggesting that Syk may regulate tau degradation or tau protein translation. In summary, these results show that the accumulation of tau pathogenic species can trigger Syk activation, as shown in Tg Tau P301S mice (Figs. <8>, <9>, <10>, <11>, <12> and <13>), whereas Syk itself appears to regulate total tau levels and tau phosphorylation at multiple epitopes (Fig. <14>) therefore influencing the development of the tau pathology. We also performed different immunostainings against Aβ, pSyk, GFAP, Iba-1, tau pathogenic conformers (MC1) and phosphorylated tau at Y18 using brain sections from human AD and non-demented controls. We found an increase in Syk activation in DNs surrounding Aβ deposits as well as in neurons displaying an accumulation of phosphorylated Tau at Y18 and elevated levels of MC1 pathogenic tau conformers in AD brain sections whereas only weak immunoreactivity for pSyk was observed in brain sections from a non-demented control (Figs. <15>, <16> and <17>).

PMC5588676_14,"These data complement our observation in AD mouse models and reveal an association between Syk activation and typical AD pathological lesions in the human brain  Further studies will be required using a larger sample of AD pathological specimen to further clarify the role of Syk activation in AD brains. Our previous studies have shown that tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ production and neuroinflammation are reduced following Syk inhibition [<28>]. These data prompted us to investigate the level of Syk activation in different mouse models of AD and in brain sections from a non-demented control and an AD patient. We found that Syk activation occurs in three different mouse models of AD, overexpressing Aβ or tau, showing that Syk activation is triggered by both Aβ deposits and tau pathological species. Most importantly, we made similar observations in human AD brain sections.Recent late phase clinical trials targeting the major pathological hallmarks of AD, mainly extracellular Aβ plaques or intra-neuronal tau aggregates, have been unsuccessful so far and have failed to prevent cognitive decline and brain atrophy in AD patients [<7>, <19>, <37>, <39>]. As PET scan imaging of AD patients reveals that Aβ deposits and pathological tau accumulation occur during the prodromal phase of AD [<26>], it has been suggested that therapies that are targeting Aβ or pathological tau accumulation must be implemented decades before the appearance of the symptoms to be successful [<26>]. Hence, pharmacological intervention at downstream targets of Aβ and tau may represent a more promising therapeutic strategy for AD patients. However, therapeutic targets downstream of the Aβ and tau pathological lesions remain to be identified. Our work supports the view that Syk may be such a therapeutic target as it appears to be activated in vivo in response to β-amyloidosis and the formation of pathological tau species.In this study, we report a hyperactivation of Syk in the brains of three different AD mouse models versus wild-type/littermate controls and human AD compared to non-demented controls. In Tg PS1/APPsw, Tg APPsw mice, Syk activity is largely increased in activated microglia and in DNs around Aβ deposits. In addition, we observed an activation of Syk in DNs around Aβ deposits in an AD pathological specimen. In Tg Tau P301S mice and AD brain sections, Syk hyperactivation is colocalized with misfolded tau and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons.The strong increase in activated Syk observed in dystrophic neurites (DNs) surrounding Aβ deposits may suggest the involvement of Syk in the formation of these DNs that ultimately leads to the synaptic loss observed in AD [<32>]. DNs are characterized by an accumulation of BACE-1 and sAPPβ which implies a contribution of DNs to Aβ production and accumulation [<31>]. In fact, several in vivo studies have shown that BACE-1 immunopositive dystrophic neurites precede Aβ plaque formation in the brains of 3xTg-AD, 2xFAD and 5xFAD mice and therefore, represent an early pathological event in AD [<2>, <16>, <45>]. Our previous in vitro and in vivo data have shown that Syk regulates Aβ and sAPPβ production via a modulation of BACE-1 expression [<28>] and therefore support a causative role of Syk activation in the accumulation of BACE-1 and sAPPβ in DNs.The increased activation of Syk in activated microglia of Aβ-overexpressing mice further supports a role of Syk in microglial activation in vivo and suggests that Aβ accumulation can lead to an activation of Syk in microglia. Previous in vitro studies have shown that Aβ fibrils and oligomers can trigger a microglial inflammatory response mediated by Syk and leading to neurotoxicity [<3>, <4>, <23>].Recruitment and activation of Syk can also be mediated by activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) [<18>]. TREM2 is a type I transmembrane protein and part of the immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor superfamily. Since TREM2 does not have any cytoplasmic signaling motifs, an adaptor protein DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12, also known as TYROBP) is needed for TREM2 signal transduction. DAP12 interacts with the transmembrane domain of TREM2. The cytoplasmic domain of DAP12 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) that provides docking sites for Syk activation. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in the DAP12 or TREM2 genes cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD) whereas heterozygous carriers of these mutations show an elevated risk to develop AD [<27>]. Symptoms of NDH include multifocal bone cysts and presenile dementia. Interestingly, Syk activation (pSyk, Y525/526) is increased in NHD neurons compared to controls [<33>] and was found to be also present in microglia and macrophages but not in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes [<33>] supporting a role of Syk activation in the development of NHD dementia.Syk plays a key role in the activation of immune cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines. We have shown previously that activation of NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) which is known to play a regulatory role in neuroinflammation, is prevented following either pharmacological Syk inhibition or genetic knockdown of Syk [<28>]. Hence, this suggests a role of Syk in the regulation of neuroinflammation. In addition, Syk has been shown to mediate the neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity caused by Aβ [<3>, <23>]. Furthermore, the Aβ-induced cytokine production by microglia has been found to be mediated by Syk [<4>], suggesting that Syk is involved in the microglial proinflammatory response.The pathological analysis of Tg Tau P301S mice shows that Syk activation is associated with the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau and misfolded tau in the hippocampus and cortex while our previous work has shown that Syk inhibition can reduce tau phosphorylation at multiple AD relevant epitopes [<28>]. Interestingly, we show here that Syk upregulation in human neuronal like SH-SY5Y cells induces tau accumulation and tau phosphorylation further confirming a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathogenic species. Altogether, our data suggest that Syk activation may also promote tau hyperphosphorylation and misfolding in vivo as neurons that show higher levels of Syk activation also show more accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and tau pathogenic conformers. Pathological tau species accumulation clearly results in Syk activation in Tg Tau P301S mice while Syk activation appears to be a mediator of the formation of tau pathogenic species, thereby implying the existence of a positive feedback loop resulting in an enhanced progression of tau pathology. Given that Syk is also present in DNs which exhibit tau accumulation and tau phosphorylation [<35>, <40>], this further supports a pathological role of Syk in the formation of DNs and ultimately synaptical loss.Our previous in vivo and in vitro data show decreased tau phosphorylation at multiple epitopes (S396/404, S202, Y18) following Syk inhibition [<28>]. Interestingly, we show here that Syk overexpression in SH-SY5Y cells increases tau phosphorylation and total tau levels (Y18, S396/404, DA9). The increase in total tau levels following Syk upregulation is not caused by an increased transcription, as tau mRNA levels do not vary between Syk overexpressing and control cells (data not shown). Therefore, increased Syk levels may lead to an increased translation or decreased degradation of tau or a combination of both. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased tau levels following Syk overexpression or decreased tau following Syk inhibition remain to be further investigated and are currently being studied in our laboratory.In this study, we also provide evidence for an aberrant Syk activation in dystrophic neurites around Aβ deposits and in neurons immunopositive for pathological tau species in human AD brain sections further validating the data obtained with different transgenic mouse models of AD."
PMC5588676_15,"In conclusion, our data support a pathological role of Syk in the formation of Aβ deposits and misfolded tau and suggest additionally that reduction of Syk hyperactivity through pharmacological inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD  The pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by dystrophic neurites (DNs) surrounding extracellular Aβ-plaques, microgliosis, astrogliosis, intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. We have previously shown that inhibition of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) lowers Aβ production and tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that Aβ-overexpressing Tg PS1/APPsw, Tg APPsw mice, and tau overexpressing Tg Tau P301S mice exhibit a pathological activation of Syk compared to wild-type littermates. Syk activation is occurring in a subset of microglia and is age-dependently increased in Aβ-plaque-associated dystrophic neurites of Tg PS1/APPsw and Tg APPsw mice. In Tg Tau P301S mice, a pure model of tauopathy, activated Syk occurs in neurons that show an accumulation of misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, the tau pathology is exacerbated in neurons that display high levels of Syk activation supporting a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathological species in vivo. Importantly, human AD brain sections show both pathological Syk activation in DNs around Aβ deposits and in neurons immunopositive for pathological tau species recapitulating the data obtained in transgenic mouse models of AD. Additionally, we show that Syk overexpression leads to increased tau accumulation and promotes tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes in human neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, further supporting a role of Syk in the formation of tau pathogenic species. Collectively, our data show that Syk activation occurs following Aβ deposition and the formation of tau pathological species. Given that we have previously shown that Syk activation also promotes Aβ formation and tau hyperphosphorylation, our data suggest that AD pathological lesions may be self-propagating via a Syk dependent mechanism highlighting Syk as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. ."
PMC5242301_0,"The etiology of astrocyte dysfunction is not well understood even though neuronal defects have been extensively studied in a variety of neuronal degenerative diseases. Astrocyte defects could be triggered by the oxidative stress that occurs during physiological aging. Here, we provide evidence that intracellular or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) at physiological levels can cause hippocampal (neuronal) dysfunctions. Specifically, we demonstrate that astrocyte defects occur in the hippocampal area of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice with the SDHCV69E mutation. These mice are characterized by chronic oxidative stress. Even though both young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice overproduced MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS compared to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice, only young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice upregulated manganese and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Mn‐ and Cu/Zn‐SODs) activities to eliminate the MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS. In contrast, middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice accumulated both MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS and CM‐H2DCFDA‐detectable intracellular ROS. These ROS levels appeared to be in the physiological range as shown by normal thiol and glutathione disulfide/glutathione concentrations in both young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice relative to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, only middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice showed JNK/SAPK activation and Ca2+ overload, particularly in astrocytes. This led to decreasing levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100β in the hippocampal area. Significantly, there were no pathological features such as apoptosis, amyloidosis, and lactic acidosis in neurons and astrocytes. Our findings suggest that the age‐dependent physiologically relevant chronic oxidative stress caused astrocyte defects in mice with impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain functionality. We are very thankful to the member of Education and Research Support Center and Animal Care Center in Tokai University. We also thank Mr S. Asari, and Ms S. Iwamoto to assist the animal care and Western blot analyses. It has recently been reported that astrocyte defects such as astrogliosis, astroglial death and astrocytic beading (clasmatodendrosis) are pathophysiological phenotypes in neuronal degenerations, frontotemporal dementia, ischemic brain injury or status epilepticus. However, the causes and effects of these phenomena remain incompletely understood. In <1961>, Friede and Houten demonstrated that the experimental incubation of cerebellar tissue from rats in glucose or in glucose‐6‐phosphate in the presence of cyanide resulted in clasmatodendrosis of astrocytes and marked edematous changes, particularly in the neuroglia of the Purkinje layer (Friede et al. 1961). In addition, Hulse et al. (<2001>) demonstrated astrocytic beading (clasmatodendrosis) in hippocampal organ cultures. Astrocytes in the periventricular white matter exhibited clasmatodendrosis, defined as cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolation of astroglia, with disintegrating and beading of their dendrites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease patients (Tomimoto et al., <1997>; Sahlas et al., <2002>). Other reports demonstrated that astrocytes showed enlarged, irregular shapes and vacuolation. In addition, their processes appeared fragmented in frontotemporal dementia (FTD; Su et al., <2000>; Martin et al., <2001>). Furthermore, astrocytic clasmatodendrosis and death were caused after hypoxic–ischemic injury in developing brains of rats and humans (Gelot et al., <2009>). Ischemia and reperfusion cause acute oxidative stress and result in necrotic cell death and severe injury. It has also been reported that astrocytic clasmatodendrosis is closely associated with disseminated selective neuronal cell death and maturation of injury after ischemia. The thinned out astrocytic end‐feet with degenerated mitochondria, which are represented as degeneration of astrocytic processes (APs), is exhibited in neuropil (Ito et al., <2009>). We hypothesized that these astrocyte defects could be also by induced by chronic oxidative stress.We have previously investigated the short‐lived mev‐1 mutant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which was isolated based upon its hypersensitivity to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐generating chemical methyl viologen (Ishii et al., <1990>). In addition to its hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, mev‐1 mutants aged precociously under hyperoxia (Honda et al., <1993>; Hosokawa et al., <1994>; Adachi et al., <1998>). The mev‐1(kn‐1) mutation, which resulted in an amino acid substitution at the 71st position from glycine to glutamate (G71E), was identified as residing in the putative gene cyt‐1 [succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) cytochrome b large subunit in complex II, a human SDHC gene homologue] (Ishii et al., <1998>). These mutants showed elevated mitochondrial ROS that was caused by the compromised complex II leading to electron leakage from the electron transport system (Senoo‐Matsuda et al., <2001>).Recently, we established mev‐1‐mimic conditional transgenic mice (Tet‐mev‐1) with the equivalent mutation in SDHC using our modified Tet On/Off tetracycline system. Expression was uniquely controlled by both rTetR (recombinant tetracycline receptor)‐VP16 (reverse tetracycline‐dependent transcriptional activator) and TetR‐KRAB (tetracycline‐dependent transcriptional repressor; Ishii et al., <2011>). The mev‐1‐mimic mutation results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 69 (V69E; Ishii et al., <2005>; Ishii et al., <2013>). The Tet‐mev‐1 mice ubiquitously and competitively expressed the mev‐1‐mimic SDHCV69E mutation coding transgene at levels less than the endogenous SDHC gene in various tissues. It is important to note that this model elevated oxidative stress caused by the electron leakage from genetically impaired mitochondrial electron transport system in some predicted tissues with complex II activity, even though this was not a tissue‐specific conditional transgenic animal model. Tet‐mev‐1 conditional transgenic mice grew to normal size in 12 weeks after suffering of low birthweight and initial growth retardation. They had low fertility and recurrent miscarriages (Ishii et al., <2011>, <2014>). After normal development, male and female Tet‐mev‐1 mice showed accelerated corneal dysfunctions with age, that is, delayed epithelialization with keratitis, decreasing endothelial cells such as Fuch's corneal dystrophy, and thickened Descemet's membrane (Onouchi et al., <2012>). Also, male Tet‐mev‐1 mice developed lacrimal gland inflammation resulting in dry eyes (Uchino et al., <2012>). A number of pathophysiological phenotypes attributable to oxidative stress [e.g., elevated carbonylated protein and 8‐oxoguanine (8‐OHdG) levels] were significantly higher in 12‐month‐old Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice.In this report, we assessed the effects of age‐dependent oxidative stress in the hippocampus induced by genetically impaired mitochondrial electron transport. We also explored whether this physiologically relevant chronic oxidative stress could lead to age‐dependent brain dysfunction and astrocyte defects in mice. We first measured wild‐type and mutant SDHC protein levels in the hippocampal area. The SDHC protein level, including the SDHCV69E protein, was increased 1.7 times in doxycycline‐treated Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to wild‐type C57BL/6J mice under the same conditions. Rather than using Tet‐mev‐1 mice that were not treated with doxycycline, C57BL/6J mice with doxycycline treatment served as controls in all experiments. This eliminated the possibility of abnormal levels of oxidative stress in the control mice, which might have occurred in the Tet‐mev‐1 mice even when SDHCV69E was not induced. The SDHC level was experimentally identical in doxycycline‐treated and untreated C57BL/6J mice and untreated Tet‐mev‐1 mice. We also determined the ROS levels in submitochondrial particles of the hippocampal area in the mev‐1‐mimic mutant SDHCV69E
Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice. As expected, the ROS level was elevated by 1."

They were found to be equivalent in terms of β‐amyloid 1–42 accumulation in astrocytes by immunohistochemistry using β‐amyloid 1–42 antibody. There was no pathological abnormality such as amyloidosis in any age‐group (Fig. S2). As well, there was no detectable apoptotic cell death as measured by TUNEL staining in the hippocampal area of any of the age‐grouped mice (Fig. S3). In addition, the lactate accumulation level, which can be increased in rare neurodegenerative disorders such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke‐like episodes syndrome (Salsano et al., <2011>; Emmanuele et al., <2012>), was not different in the hippocampal area of Tet‐mev‐1 mice as compared to the age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice at each age (Fig. S4). These results indicate that there were no detectable pathological features (e.g., β‐amyloid 1–42 amyloidosis, apoptosis, and lactic acidosis) in the brain of young adult, middle‐aged, and senior‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice. This strongly suggests that the abnormalities we document below are not secondary consequences of, for example, lactic acidosis. Mitochondrial ROS levels were measured using MitoSOX Red on in vitro‐cultured tissue sections of the hippocampal area in the presence or absence of the semiquinone‐like inhibitor 2‐n‐heptyl‐4‐hydroxyquinoline‐N‐oxide (HQNO) for the measurement of production or accumulation levels of ROS, respectively.

From a statistical perspective, production levels were dramatically decreased in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice relative to young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice, excepting in the CA3 region (Fig. <1>B).

Mitochondrial ROS production levels in vitro with artificial (HQNO‐induced) ROS production were increased in the granule and pyramidal cells including cells of other areas present in the HQNO‐treated hippocampal sections of young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to those of the age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. <1>A). From a statistical perspective, production levels were dramatically decreased in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice relative to young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice, excepting in the CA3 region (Fig. <1>B). This result indicates that the mitochondrial ROS production was higher under conditions of cell proliferation and differentiation and was downregulated in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice, especially the DG region.However, somewhat surprisingly, there was no statistical difference in MitoSOX Red fluorescent intensities in the granule and pyramidal cells of young adult Tet‐mev‐1 vs. wild‐type C57BL/6J mice in the absence of HQNO, indicating equivalent mitochondrial ROS accumulation levels in vivo under the physiologically maintained SOD activity (Fig. <2>A,B). On the other hand, the middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice had statistically elevated accumulation levels in cells of pyramidal layer and the other areas of the CA3 and CA1 regions (Fig. <2>A,B). In the DG region of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice, the accumulation level was not statistically elevated in granule cells, but there was frequently more detected in cells of the other areas (Fig. <2>B). There are strongly fluorescent cells, and it seems to astrocytes with large cell body in the other areas (Fig. S5A,B).We then compared the ability to scavenge ROS in Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice at each age. We first measured manganese and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Mn‐ and Cu/Zn‐SOD) activities in Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice. Both Mn‐ and Cu/Zn‐SOD activities were approximately 1."

However, the Mn‐SOD activity in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice was approximately equal, decreasing to roughly half from that in each young adult (Fig. <3>A). In contrast, Cu/Zn‐SOD activity was not changed in wild‐type mice with age, but significantly decreased in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to that of young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice (Fig. <3>A). rhetorical Figure 3 Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and intracellular ROS levels.

There are strongly fluorescent cells, and it seems to astrocytes with large cell body in the other areas (Fig. S5A,B).We then compared the ability to scavenge ROS in Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice at each age. We first measured manganese and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Mn‐ and Cu/Zn‐SOD) activities in Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice. Both Mn‐ and Cu/Zn‐SOD activities were approximately 1.5‐fold higher in young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice than in the age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. <3>A). However, the Mn‐SOD activity in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice was approximately equal, decreasing to roughly half from that in each young adult (Fig. <3>A). In contrast, Cu/Zn‐SOD activity was not changed in wild‐type mice with age, but significantly decreased in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to that of young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice (Fig. <3>A).Next, total intracellular ROS levels were determined using 5‐(and‐6)‐chloromethyl‐2′,7′‐dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM‐H2DCFDA) on in vitro‐cultured tissue sections of the hippocampal area. Interestingly, the CM‐H2DCFDA chemical fluorescence, which detects primarily hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, was particularly strong in cells of the other areas, not granular and pyramidal layers, even though those shapes are like particle aggregates different from MitoSOX Red's fluorescence (Figs <3>B and S5C). The levels were statistically increased in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to the age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice, even though levels were lower than in young adult mice (Fig. <3>C). These CM‐H2DCFDA‐detectable intracellular ROS levels were similar to the accumulation levels of MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS dependent on mitochondrial electron transport activation. This result suggests that oxidative stress was induced in a physiological range by the impaired mitochondria of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice. Next, we analyzed the redox stability, and thiol and glutathione (GSH) levels to confirm that oxidative stress was in a physiological range. Thiols are effective nonenzymatic or enzymatic scavengers of hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, decreased thiol levels, particularly GSH, are an oxidative stress indicator (Chinta et al., <2007>; Danielson et al., <2011>). Total thiols and GSH levels increased in both animals with age, but there were no differences between Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. S6A,B). Therefore, although glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels were increased in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 and wild‐type C57BL/6J mice compared to young adults, the GSSG/GSH ratio of Tet‐mev‐1 mice was the same as wild‐type C57BL/6J mice in both ages (Fig. S6B,C). This result suggests that intracellular ROS, especially hydrogen peroxide, were effectively scavenged by nonenzymatic or enzymatic antioxidant abilities under these physiologically homeostatic conditions. Consequently, carbonylated protein ratios, an indicator of the oxidative stress on intracellular components, were normal for both young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to wild‐type C57BL/6J mice in each age (Fig. S7). In summary, these results indicate that despite more ROS generation in Tet‐mev‐1 mice, the resultant oxidative stress was controlled to physiologically normal levels in both aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice.We next looked in the hippocampal areas at levels of c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases/stress‐activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs), which control oxidative stress‐responsible signal transduction pathways (Zhu et al., <2004>). Phosphorylated forms of p46‐ and p54‐JNK/SAPKs (JNK1 and 2) were increased approximately twofold in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to same aged wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. <4>A,B). Specifically, the phosphorylated forms of p46‐ and p54‐JNK/SAPKs (JNK1 and 2) were detected by immunohistochemistry in cells of other areas excepting the granule and pyramidal cells (Figs <4>C and S8A). This suggests that the cells seem to astrocytes in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice are subjected to chronic oxidative stress, and it affects intracellular homeostatic adaptations with upregulated redox signal transductions under physiological controls. Additionally, Ca2+‐overloaded cells were detected with the rhodamine‐like Ca2+ fluorescence indicator Rhod‐2‐AM. Ca2+‐overloaded cells were markedly present among the cells of the other areas, not pyramidal layer of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice, especially the CA3 and CA1 regions (Figs <4>D and S8B)."

This agreed with the results of immunohistochemistry using each antibody on the paraffin sections of hippocampal area (Fig. <5>C).Furthermore, neuronal activity in the hippocampal area was evaluated by measuring the activation of CREB (cAMP response element‐binding protein) transcription factor. CREB is phosphorylated to play a key role in neuronal plasticity and long‐term spatial memory. It is important to note that long‐term spatial memory requires new protein syntheses in the hippocampus by the activation of CREB transcriptional factor (Silva et al., <1998>; Lonze & Ginty, <2002>). Basal and inductive phosphorylated CREB/total CREB levels were quantified in Western blot analysis using phosphorylated CREB (Ser133) and CREB antibodies.

However, in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice, the ratio dropped to approximately half as compared to C57BL/6J mice same as basal levels of phosphorylated CREB (Fig. <6>A,B). Not surprisingly, hippocampus‐dependent memory consolidation was disrupted in a long‐term memory test using a Morris water maze in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice, reflecting the decreasing of inductive phosphorylated CREB levels. The memory consolidation ability of young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice was not changed (Fig. <6>C).We then looked at some upstream regulators of phosphorylated CREB level using Western blot analysis (Bito et al., <1996>; Silva et al., <1998>). The levels of phosphorylated‐to‐total protein ratios of PKA (protein kinase A), CaMK (Ca2+/CaM‐dependent protein kinase) IV, and PP1 (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1) were statistically identical between young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice relative to wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. S11A–D). As well, the catalytic subunit (calcineurin A) of calcineurin [protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B)] level was also equally expressed in young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice relative to wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. S11A,E). In contrast, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C subunit and phosphorylated p38 MAPK levels were significantly decreased in young Tet‐mev‐1 adults relative to wild‐type C57BL/6J mice, and the levels were also significantly increased with age (Fig. <6>D). It has previously been reported that PP2A activity, which is required for p38‐mediated dephosphorylation, regulates PKA‐phosphorylated CREB transcriptional activity (Wadzinski et al., <1993>; Junttila et al., <2008>; Maalouf & Rho, <2008>; Fey et al., <2012>). Our results are consistent with these past results, which is that the basal phosphorylated CREB level is controlled by the phosphatase activity through p38 MAPK‐PP2A signal transduction. In this report, we focused on the brain functional changes in response to physiologically relevant chronic oxidative stress produced by genetically impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity as a function of age. The changes we detected occurred before mice developed pathological features such as amyloidosis, apoptosis, and lactic acidosis.First, we confirmed that mitochondrial ROS, mainly superoxide anion, and CM‐H2DCFDA‐detectable ROS (mainly hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) accumulated at higher levels in most of the granule and pyramidal cells and some cells of other areas, which seem to astrocytes with large cell body, of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice, even though the levels were lower than young adult mice. The increase in ROS in Tet‐mev‐1 mice was compensated by the animals’ intracellular antioxidant ability and/or redox signal transduction pathways. As a result, oxidative stress was kept in the physiological range as manifested by identical levels of thiol and disulfide GSH compared to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice. Consequently, all ages examined [young adult (4–8 months old), middle‐aged (10–14 months old), and senior‐aged (24–28 months old)] did not develop detectable pathological features such as amyloidosis, apoptosis, and lactic acidosis.Middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice accumulated intracellular ROS particularly in their astrocytes. They displayed diminished glial astrocyte intermediate filament protein (GFAP) and S100β. Those mice with astrocyte defects also showed Ca2+ overload and JNK/SAPK activation. JNK/SAPK is a member of the stress‐activated MAPK signal transduction pathway and has been linked to the cell death and redox signaling, so‐called cell death signaling. Based upon these results, we speculate that the intracellular oxidative stress, which is produced by genetically impaired mitochondrial ROS, might preferentially occur in astrocytes and accumulate as the antioxidant activity diminishes with age. In addition, Ca2+ overload serves as an oxidative stress marker in neuronal degenerative disease's pathophysiological phenotypes. For example, it has been reported that increasing Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ overload assist in promoting cell death with oxidative stress by ischemia–reperfusion (Kristian & Siesjo, <1998>)."
PMC5242301_5,"In addition, toxic forms of β‐amyloid induce Ca2+ influx into neurons by inducing membrane‐associated oxidative stress or by forming oligomeric membrane pores, thereby rendering neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis (Bezprozvanny & Mattson, <2008>)  Our results in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice suggest that Ca2+ overload could be an initial marker of pathophysiological changes. Therefore, the appearance of astrocyte defects with JNK/SAPK activation and Ca2+ overload might be an important age‐dependent physiological change in the central nervous system with impaired mitochondrial oxidative stress. These age‐dependent, oxidative stress‐sensitive physiological changes might disrupt the neuron‐astrocyte cross talk. For example, the exchange from glucose to pyruvate through lactate transport from astrocytes to neurons is required for activated neurons in memory consolidation (Suzuki et al., <2011>). We demonstrated that the genetically impaired mitochondrial ROS production, which ultimately resulted in chronic physiologically relevant oxidative stress, decreased basal and inductive phosphorylated CREB levels independent of cAMP‐ and Ca2+/CaM‐dependent signal transduction in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice.In general, it has been reported that a number of neurodegenerative diseases involve astrogliosis, which is clinically characterized as abnormal morphology and excessive proliferation of astrocytes (Sofroniew, <2009>). However, astrocyte loss has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, FTD, and hypoxic–ischemic injury (Kim et al., <2011>; Ryu et al., <2011a>,<b>; Misu et al., <2013>; Sakai et al., <2013>). This includes autophagic astroglial death defined by cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolation, beading and dissolution of their processes (clasmatodendrosis), and nuclear alterations resembling apoptosis.We propose that the effects of chronic physiologically relevant oxidative stress can lead to astrocyte defects. In turn, these might cause the age‐dependent CREB inactivation in neurons via age‐dependent polarity changes of p38 MAPK‐PP2A signal transduction. Young adults are able to adapt to oxidative stress with inactivating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals. In contrast, middle‐aged adults upregulate JNK/SAPK cell death signaling with Ca2+ overload in astrocytes. The resulting astrocyte defects could cause disrupted memory consolidation via diminished basal and inductive phosphorylated CREB with activating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals. As illustrated in the graphical summary (Fig. <7>), we could not specifically identify negative effects on neuron‐astrocyte cross talk. However, we demonstrated a number of molecular changes consistent with this, including JNK/SAPK activation in astrocytes, Ca2+ overload in astrocytes, CREB inactivation via activating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals in neuronal activity. This could have resulted in the observed disrupted memory consolidation. In addition, the memory consolidation defects we observed could be partially attributed to direct neuronal damage by chronic oxidative stress. We anticipate that Tet‐mev‐1 mice will continue to be a suitable model to clarify the effects of oxidative stress on neuron‐astrocyte cross talk as well as to study the effects of oxidative stress on specifically on neurons or astrocytes. rhetorical Figure 7 Graphical summary of the effects of chronic physiologically relevant oxidative stress from impaired mitochondria. The oxidative stress upregulates JNK/SAPK cell death signaling with Ca2+ overload in astrocytes. The resulting astrocyte defects could cause disrupted memory consolidation via diminished basal and inductive phosphorylated CREB with activating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals. Alternatively, or in addition, memory consolidation could be impacted by the effects of oxidative stress directly on neurons. In this report, we focused on the brain functional changes in response to physiologically relevant chronic oxidative stress produced by genetically impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity as a function of age. The changes we detected occurred before mice developed pathological features such as amyloidosis, apoptosis, and lactic acidosis.First, we confirmed that mitochondrial ROS, mainly superoxide anion, and CM‐H2DCFDA‐detectable ROS (mainly hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) accumulated at higher levels in most of the granule and pyramidal cells and some cells of other areas, which seem to astrocytes with large cell body, of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice compared to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice, even though the levels were lower than young adult mice.

Consequently, all ages examined [young adult (4–8 months old), middle‐aged (10–14 months old), and senior‐aged (24–28 months old)] did not develop detectable pathological features such as amyloidosis, apoptosis, and lactic acidosis.Middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice accumulated intracellular ROS particularly in their astrocytes. They displayed diminished glial astrocyte intermediate filament protein (GFAP) and S100β. Those mice with astrocyte defects also showed Ca2+ overload and JNK/SAPK activation. JNK/SAPK is a member of the stress‐activated MAPK signal transduction pathway and has been linked to the cell death and redox signaling, so‐called cell death signaling. Based upon these results, we speculate that the intracellular oxidative stress, which is produced by genetically impaired mitochondrial ROS, might preferentially occur in astrocytes and accumulate as the antioxidant activity diminishes with age. In addition, Ca2+ overload serves as an oxidative stress marker in neuronal degenerative disease's pathophysiological phenotypes. For example, it has been reported that increasing Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ overload assist in promoting cell death with oxidative stress by ischemia–reperfusion (Kristian & Siesjo, <1998>). In addition, toxic forms of β‐amyloid induce Ca2+ influx into neurons by inducing membrane‐associated oxidative stress or by forming oligomeric membrane pores, thereby rendering neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis (Bezprozvanny & Mattson, <2008>). Our results in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice suggest that Ca2+ overload could be an initial marker of pathophysiological changes. Therefore, the appearance of astrocyte defects with JNK/SAPK activation and Ca2+ overload might be an important age‐dependent physiological change in the central nervous system with impaired mitochondrial oxidative stress. These age‐dependent, oxidative stress‐sensitive physiological changes might disrupt the neuron‐astrocyte cross talk. For example, the exchange from glucose to pyruvate through lactate transport from astrocytes to neurons is required for activated neurons in memory consolidation (Suzuki et al., <2011>). We demonstrated that the genetically impaired mitochondrial ROS production, which ultimately resulted in chronic physiologically relevant oxidative stress, decreased basal and inductive phosphorylated CREB levels independent of cAMP‐ and Ca2+/CaM‐dependent signal transduction in middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice.In general, it has been reported that a number of neurodegenerative diseases involve astrogliosis, which is clinically characterized as abnormal morphology and excessive proliferation of astrocytes (Sofroniew, <2009>). However, astrocyte loss has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, FTD, and hypoxic–ischemic injury (Kim et al., <2011>; Ryu et al., <2011a>,<b>; Misu et al., <2013>; Sakai et al., <2013>). This includes autophagic astroglial death defined by cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolation, beading and dissolution of their processes (clasmatodendrosis), and nuclear alterations resembling apoptosis.We propose that the effects of chronic physiologically relevant oxidative stress can lead to astrocyte defects."
PMC5242301_6,"In turn, these might cause the age‐dependent CREB inactivation in neurons via age‐dependent polarity changes of p38 MAPK‐PP2A signal transduction  Young adults are able to adapt to oxidative stress with inactivating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals. In contrast, middle‐aged adults upregulate JNK/SAPK cell death signaling with Ca2+ overload in astrocytes. The resulting astrocyte defects could cause disrupted memory consolidation via diminished basal and inductive phosphorylated CREB with activating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals. As illustrated in the graphical summary (Fig. <7>), we could not specifically identify negative effects on neuron‐astrocyte cross talk. However, we demonstrated a number of molecular changes consistent with this, including JNK/SAPK activation in astrocytes, Ca2+ overload in astrocytes, CREB inactivation via activating p38 MAPK‐PP2A signals in neuronal activity. This could have resulted in the observed disrupted memory consolidation. In addition, the memory consolidation defects we observed could be partially attributed to direct neuronal damage by chronic oxidative stress. We anticipate that Tet‐mev‐1 mice will continue to be a suitable model to clarify the effects of oxidative stress on neuron‐astrocyte cross talk as well as to study the effects of oxidative stress on specifically on neurons or astrocytes. Both wild‐type C57BL/6J as controls and C57BL/6J background Tet‐mev‐1 conditional transgenic mice were treated with doxycycline hyclate (0.1 mg mL−1 doxycycline with 0.01 mg mL−1 saccharine for fertile and pregnant mice or 0.4 mg mL−1 doxycycline with 0.05 mg mL−1 saccharine for experimental mice after weaning in drinking water) throughout prenatal development to adulthood. Young adult (4–8 months old) and middle‐aged (10–14 months old) mice were used for all studies. All animals were maintained on a 12‐h light/dark cycle under a specific‐pathogen free (SPF) condition: 22 ± 1 °C, approximately 40% humidity, 12/12‐h light/dark cycle, a standard diet CE2 (9.3% water, 25.8% crude protein, 4.5% crude fat, 4.5% crude fiber, 6.7% crude ash; CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and sterile water with doxycycline and saccharine ad libitum. All protocols complied with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of Tokai University and were approved by the Tokai University Animal Care Committees. The brains were removed and placed in ice‐cold Hank's solution (NISSUI Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan), which was continuously bubbled with 95% O2 + 5% CO2 for over 30 min after deaeration. Coronal slices of 250 μm thickness were cut with a vibratome (LEICA VT 1000 S; Leica Microsystems, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred into a mesh‐bottom holding chamber containing Hank's solution bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 + 5% CO2, leaving the final pH at 7.4. The slices were kept at 37 °C until the onset of the experiments. Mitochondrial ROS production was monitored at 37 °C by using the oxidation‐sensitive red fluorescence dye MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes: M36008), which is mitochondrially targeted probe and sensitive to mitochondrial ROS, mainly superoxide anion by the electron leakage from mitochondria. The dye (50 μg) was freshly dissolved each day in 13 μL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The slices were loaded with 5 μm MitoSOX Red including Hank's medium for 10 min at 37 °C, some of which were pretreated with 10 μL semiquinone‐like inhibitor HQNO, which inhibits electron transport (Van Ark & Berden, <1977>; Christenson et al., <2008>) (2 mg mL−1) for 30 min at 37 °C. HQNO treatment leads to electron leakage from the electron transport chain. This results in artificial mitochondrial ROS production (as detected with MitoSOX Red). After loading, the slices were washed three times and then left in Hank's solution.Intracellular ROS production was monitored at 37 °C by using the oxidation‐sensitive dye 5‐(and‐6)‐chloromethyl‐2′,7′‐dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM‐H2DCFDA) which is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (HO˙; Molecular Probes: C6827). CM‐H2DCFDA is a nonfluorescent dye until the acetate groups are removed by intracellular esterases and oxidation occurs within the cell. The dye (50 μg) was freshly dissolved each day in 10 μL DMSO. The slices were loaded with 10 μm CM‐H2DCFDA in the dark (30 min; 37 °C; 0.02% [w/v] Pluronic F127). After loading, the slices were washed 5 times and then left in Hank's solution. Five millimolar probenecid was added to every solution used after loading to inhibit organic anion transporters that remove fluorescent dyes from the cytoplasm in a temperature‐dependent way.Intracellular overloaded Ca2+ levels were monitored at 37 °C by using the rhodamine‐like fluorescent indicator Rhod‐2‐AM, 1‐[2‐Amino‐5‐(3‐dimethylamino‐6‐dimethylammonio‐9‐xanthenyl)phenoxy]‐2‐(2‐amino‐5‐methylphenoxy)ethane‐N,N,N′,N′‐tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester, chloride (Dojindo: R002, 341‐05821). This indicator's dissociation constant (K
d
 = 1.0 μmol L−1) is higher than the physiological range of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, <200 nmol L−1, and less than extracellular fluid Ca2+ concentration, about 1 mmol L−1 (Minta et al., <1989>). The dye (50 μg) was freshly dissolved each day in 100 μL DMSO. The slices were loaded with 4.5 μm Rhod‐2 in the dark (30 min; 37 °C; 0.02% [w/v] Pluronic F127). After loading, the slices were washed five times and then left in Hank's solution.Slices were submerged and mounted by a cover glass in 35‐mm tissue culture dishes, excited at 510 nm for MitoSOX Red, 488 ± 5 nm for CM‐H2DCFDA, or 553 nm for Rhod‐2 and viewed under the Biorevo BZ‐9000 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). The emitted light (580 nm for MitoSOX Red, 535 ± 25 nm for CM‐H2DCFDA, or 567 nm for Rhod‐2) was detected and the system was controlled with the BZ Analyzer II software (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). The image frame rate and exposure time were held constant for all experiments. Three layers in the hippocampal region, CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG), were analyzed by a line profile quantification analysis of BZ Analyzer II software. Autofluorescence correction in each examined region of every individual hippocampal slice was made by point‐by‐point subtraction of the respective average intensity values of identical experiments performed on unloaded slices. Forty micrograms of total protein extract solubilized by boiling after the addition of 2 × SDS‐PAGE sample buffer [0.125 m Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 10% 2‐mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, and 0.004% bromophenol blue]/lane was resolved using 10–20% SDS‐PAGE gradient gel and analyzed by Western blot. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) Clear Blot P membrane (ATTO Corp, Tokyo, Japan) using a semi‐dry blotting machine AE‐6677 (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). To block nonspecific protein binding, membranes were treated for 2–8 h at 20–25 °C with 5% bovine serum albumin (#BAH64; Equitech‐Bio, Inc., Kerrville, TX, USA) and 0.1% Tween‐20 in TBS [0.02 m TRIZMA BASE, 0.137 m NaCl (pH 7.6)].

Actin was used as an internal control protein for loading normalization of the quantification analysis. Horseradish peroxidase‐coupled specific secondary antibodies, anti‐rabbit IgG, HRP‐linked antibody (#7074; Cell Signaling Technology), or polyclonal rabbit anti‐goat immunoglobulins/HRP antibody (P0449; Dako) were incubated in TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature in each condition. The detection system used was ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, UK). The chemiluminescence signals were visualized under LAS3000 mini (FUJIFILM Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative densitometric analysis was done using Multi Gauge Ver3.0 (FUJIFILM Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The segments of mouse brain were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) under physiological pressure and embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using phospho‐SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody (#9251S; Cell Signaling Technology), anti‐GFAP antibody (Z0334; Dako), anti‐S100 beta antibody [EP1576Y] (ab52642; Abcam), and anti‐beta amyloid 1–42 antibody (ab14220; Abcam). The deparaffinized and dehydrated sections were incubated for 5 min at 120 °C in Dako Target Retrieval Solution (pH 9.0; S2367; Dako), treated with in 3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water (dH2O), and incubated with phospho‐SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody diluted 1:100 in TBS [0.02 m TRIZMA BASE, 0.137 m NaCl (pH 7.6)], anti‐GFAP antibody (Z0334; Dako) diluted 1:500 in TBS, anti‐S100 beta antibody [EP1576Y] diluted 1:500 in TBS, and anti‐beta amyloid 1–42 antibody (ab14220; Abcam) diluted 1:500 in TBS in each reaction after blocking nonspecific protein binding in TBS containing 5% goat serum for 10 min. Sections were treated with Histofine® Simple Stain™ Mouse MAX PO (R) (414341F; Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) after washing in TBS and treated in diaminobenzidine and hematoxylin nuclear staining. The mouse hippocampal area protein extracts were prepared by a Teflon homogenizer in a volume of isolation buffer [210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mm EDTA] that was fivefold greater than the tissue weight. Mitochondria and cytosolic fraction proteins were isolated by differential centrifugation. The nuclear fraction and unbroken cells were first removed from total protein lysate of hippocampal area by centrifugating at 800 g for 30 min. The mitochondrial fraction of hippocampal area was then obtained by centrifugating at 21 000 g for 30 min. Finally, mitochondrial fraction protein was suspended in Tris–EDTA buffer [50 mm Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mm EDTA]. Biochemical analyses were performed using (i) a SOD Assay kit‐WST (S311; Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) for SOD activity measurements; (ii) 2‐methyl‐6‐p‐methoxyphenylethynyl‐imidazopyrazinone (MPEC) chemical luminescent probe (ATTO Corp, Tokyo, Japan) for the measurement of ROS level in submitochondrial particles in vitro; (iii) Lactate Pro™ with Lactate Pro™ Test Strip (Arkray, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) for the measurement of lactate level in the cytosolic fraction of hippocampal area; (iv) SensoLyteR 520 Thiol Quantification Kit *Fluorimetric* (AnaSpec, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) for the quantification analysis of total thiols level; and (v) GSSG/GSH Quantification Kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) for the GSSG/GSH ratio quantification analysis. Morris water maze testing was performed using young adult (4–8 months old) and middle‐aged (10–14 months old) female mice with the experimenter blind to genotype. Mice were handled for 5 min each for five consecutive days before beginning experiments. The arena consisted of a circular pool (diameter of 170 cm) filled with water that was temperature‐regulated (24–30 °C) and made opaque with nontoxic white tempera paint. A circle, plexiglass platform (diameter of 15 cm) was submerged 1 cm below the surface of the water and four local cues were provided to allow spatial map generation. Mice were trained swimming and escaping on the platform for 1–2 weeks. Learning occurred at a total of 15 trials over 5 days, with one session every 2 h three times per day or a total of six trials over 2 days, with one session every 2 h per day more than 1 week later after last training trial. Start locations (four local cues for the spatial map) were pseudo‐randomized so that each start location was used once per session and the sequence of start locations in any session was never used twice. Tracking and analysis of animal movement was done using the SMART Video Tracking System Version 2.5 (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). One‐way anova and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were used to analyze the difference between probe trials in the Morris water maze for pairwise comparisons. Planned comparisons, using a two‐tailed, unpaired Student's t‐test, were used to analyze differences of the time spent in the target quadrant (TQ) in the Morris water maze between two groups. Statistically, measurements of biochemical assay and Western blot were analyzed by one‐way anova, Bonferroni post hoc comparisons, and a two‐tailed, unpaired Student's t‐test.

The etiology of astrocyte dysfunction is not well understood even though neuronal defects have been extensively studied in a variety of neuronal degenerative diseases. Astrocyte defects could be triggered by the oxidative stress that occurs during physiological aging. Here, we provide evidence that intracellular or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) at physiological levels can cause hippocampal (neuronal) dysfunctions. Specifically, we demonstrate that astrocyte defects occur in the hippocampal area of middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice with the SDHCV69E mutation. These mice are characterized by chronic oxidative stress. Even though both young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice overproduced MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS compared to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice, only young adult Tet‐mev‐1 mice upregulated manganese and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Mn‐ and Cu/Zn‐SODs) activities to eliminate the MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS. In contrast, middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice accumulated both MitoSOX Red‐detectable mitochondrial ROS and CM‐H2DCFDA‐detectable intracellular ROS."
PMC5242301_8,"These ROS levels appeared to be in the physiological range as shown by normal thiol and glutathione disulfide/glutathione concentrations in both young adult and middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice relative to age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6J mice  Furthermore, only middle‐aged Tet‐mev‐1 mice showed JNK/SAPK activation and Ca2+ overload, particularly in astrocytes. This led to decreasing levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100β in the hippocampal area. Significantly, there were no pathological features such as apoptosis, amyloidosis, and lactic acidosis in neurons and astrocytes. Our findings suggest that the age‐dependent physiologically relevant chronic oxidative stress caused astrocyte defects in mice with impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain functionality. ."
PMC2709912_0,"Some of the tryptophan catabolites produced through the kynurenine pathway (KP), and more particularly the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA), are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that the KP is over activated in AD brain and that QA accumulates in amyloid plaques and within dystrophic neurons. We hypothesized that QA in pathophysiological concentrations affects tau phosphorylation. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that QA is co-localized with hyperphosphorylated tau (HPT) within cortical neurons in AD brain. We then investigated in vitro the effects of QA at various pathophysiological concentrations on tau phosphorylation in primary cultures of human neurons. Using western blot, we found that QA treatment increased the phosphorylation of tau at serine 199/202, threonine 231 and serine 396/404 in a dose dependent manner. Increased accumulation of phosphorylated tau was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. This increase in tau phosphorylation was paralleled by a substantial decrease in the total protein phosphatase activity. A substantial decrease in PP2A expression and modest decrease in PP1 expression were observed in neuronal cultures treated with QA. These data clearly demonstrate that QA can induce tau phosphorylation at residues present in the PHF in the AD brain. To induce tau phosphorylation, QA appears to act through NMDA receptor activation similar to other agonists, glutamate and NMDA. The QA effect was abrogated by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Using PCR arrays, we found that QA significantly induces 10 genes in human neurons all known to be associated with AD pathology. Of these 10 genes, 6 belong to pathways involved in tau phosphorylation and 4 of them in neuroprotection. Altogether these results indicate a likely role of QA in the AD pathology through promotion of tau phosphorylation. Understanding the mechanism of the neurotoxic effects of QA is essential in developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD.

The kynurenine pathway (KP) (<Figure 1>) is a major route of L-tryptophan catabolism, resulting in the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and other neuroactive intermediates<[1]>. Within the CNS, KP metabolites can have either neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects. Among them, quinolinic acid (QA) is perhaps the most important in terms of biological activity. Stone and Perkins were the first to demonstrated QA ability to selectively activate neurons expressing NMDA receptors<[2]>. QA neurotoxicity was then shown by Schwarcz<[3]>. QA leads acutely to human neuronal death and chronically to dysfunction by at least five mechanisms<[4]> and is known to be involved in several major neuroinflammatory diseases<[4]>, <[5]>, <[6]> including Alzheimer's disease (AD)<[7]>. rhetorical Figure 1 The kynurenine pathway (KP) (<Figure 1>) is a major route of L-tryptophan catabolism, resulting in the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and other neuroactive intermediates<[1]>.

NFTs are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF)<[8]>, <[9]> of which the microtubule associated protein tau in an abnormally hyperphosphorylated state, represents the major protein component<[10]>, <[11]>. The phosphorylation state of tau determines its biological activity<[12]>. Physiologically, tau promotes the assembly and maintenance of the microtubule structures. Abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (HPT) has less affinity for binding with microtubules. HPT also sequesters normal tau and other microtubule-associated proteins (MAP1 and MAP2) and causes disassembly of microtubules<[13]>.We have previously shown that the KP is activated in AD brain, leading to an increase in QA production<[14]>. We also found that in the hippocampus of AD patients, QA immunoreactivity is detected in cortical microglia, astrocytes and neurons. Of particular interest is the high immunoreactivity of QA in the perimeter of senile plaques and NFTs<[15]>. Human neurons do not produce QA but they can take it up<[16]>, <[17]>. The presence of a strong QA immunoreactivity in vacuoles of hippocampal and entorhinal neurons<[15]> is more likely the consequence of an uptake mechanism rather than synthesis of QA. Neuronal uptake of QA is likely to be part of a scavenging process in which activated microglia and/or infiltrating macrophages release high concentration of QA<[16]>, <[17]>. In vitro, chronic exposure of rat corticostriatal cultures to nanomolar QA concentrations leads to ultrastructural changes in neurons<[18]>. Moreover, both low level chronic (350 nM) and high level acute (1 µM) exposures of human primary neurons to QA are neurotoxic<[19]>. Indeed, chronic exposure of human neurons to QA causes significant structural changes including dendritic beading, microtubular disruption and a decrease in organelles. Altogether, the activation of the KP and the over-production of QA in AD brain, and the co-localization of QA with the histopathological lesions, particularly the QA accumulation in dystrophic neurons with the NFTs led us to hypothesize that QA is directly involved in the hyperphosphorylation of tau.We found that QA accumulates in neurons and co-localizes with tau in cortical sections from AD patients. In addition, in vitro treatment of human foetal neurons with pathophysiological concentrations of QA significantly increased tau phosphorylation at multiple phosphorylation sites. Our data also show a decrease in the expression and activity of serine/threonine protein phosphatase(s), as the mechanism for tau hyperphosphorylation. We also found that QA induces at least ten neuronal genes, with some of them known to be strongly associated with Alzheimer pathology. This study provides a new insight into the mechanism of QA neurotoxicity and its important role in the pathogenesis of AD.

On a CO2 Leica microtome, blocks were sectioned at 45 µm into 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.01% azide. Serial sections were labelled for QA (mAb, developed by Chemicon for our group) and tau (AT8, AT180, Pierce Endogen). Free floating sections were washed three times for 15 minutes each in 50% ethanol then placed in blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% azide, 0.01% TritonX) for 20 minutes, then incubated in 1° antibody for 24 hrs at 4°C. Sections were washed three times for 15 minutes each in 0.1 M Tris and incubated in species-specific biotinylated antibody for 1 hr, washed and placed in streptavidin-Alexa 647 or 594 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) diluted 1∶100 in 0.1 M Tris with 0.01% TritonX for 1 hr. For double-immunostaining, the sections were washed for one hour, incubated in blocking buffer, then transferred to the second primary antibody solution. For viewing, sections were mounted on gelatinized glass slides, cover-slipped in gelatine/glycerol and examined with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Optical sections were taken through the sections at 2 µm intervals and reconstructed using Zeiss Axiovision software and ImageJ (NIH; Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2008). For Western blots, cells were cultured in Matrigel coated 12-well plates at a density of 1×106 cells per well in supplemented Neurobasal medium supplemented (as described above). Neurons were incubated with various concentrations of QA (ranging from 50 to 1200 nM) for 72 hours. Control cultures were kept in the medium alone. Okadaic acid (100 nM) was used as positive control for tau phosphorylation. In a separate experiment, neurons were cultured with 500 nM each of NMDA receptor agonists (QA, glutamate, NMDA) and antagonists (memantine, AP-5 and MK-801) for 72 hrs. Cells were lysed in 500 µl of RIFA buffer, (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sod. deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 nM NaF, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin and 5 µg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16000 g for 10 minutes. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the modified Lowry method and stored at −20°C until used. 20 µg lysate protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 10% from Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA USA) in sample buffer. Protein was transferred onto PVDF membranes; the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS for one hour and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used are described in <Table 1>. After incubation, the membranes were rinsed several times, washed with TBS-tween three times (10 minutes each), and then two times with TBS only. The membranes were then incubated with the secondary antibody for 4 hours at RT, washed as before and developed either with ECL or Chemidox, (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. Blots were quantified using the Quantity One 4.6.1 software from Biorad and ImageJ (NIH; Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min and the absorbance measured at 405 nm. PP2A activity was indirectly measured by using 10 nM OA in the phosphatase assay buffer and calculating the OA-inhibited activity. PP2A was immunoprecipitated according the protocol provided by Upstate, New York. Briefly, 4 µg of anti-PP2A (Clone 1D6) (Upstate, New York) was incubated with 100 µl Protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham/Pharmacia) for 4 hours at 4°C on a rotor. The beads were washed with 750 µl TBS 3 times and 2 times with the phosphates lysis buffer. The beads with absorbed anti-PP2A were incubated with 400 µg lysate protein in a total volume of 500 µl overnight at 4°C. Unbound proteins were separated, and the beads were washed (by a brief pulse in table-top centrifuge) with 750 µl of TBS 3 times. For phosphatase activity, 20 µl beads were pelleted and resuspended in 200 µl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MnCl2 and 10 mM pNPP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min with occasional mixing. At the end of incubation, the beads were centrifuged and the clear supernatant was collected into the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate and the absorbance measured at 405 nm. To measure the amount of immunoprecipated PP2A, 20 µl of beads were boiled in 4× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blots as described earlier.

Profiler™ PCR Array profiles the expression of 84 key genes representative of 18 different signal transduction pathways. Using real-time PCR, we analysed the expression of a focused panel of genes related to any of the 18 signal transduction pathways involved in the response of human primary neurons to QA 150 nM for 24 h. In order to validate the relevance of QA in the mechanism of tau phosphorylation in the human disease, AD and control tissue were labelled for QA and tau (AT8, AT180). We confirmed that QA is found within cortical neurons in AD and, to a substantially lesser degree, in cortical neurons of elderly controls (<Figure 2>). QA is present intrasomally in punctate structures resembling vesicles and co-localizes with tau-positive fibrillary structures (see also supplementary <Figure S3>). QA is also seen throughout the parenchyma and enriched within plaques in vesicular structures within microglial processes. rhetorical Figure 2 QA (red; Alexa 647) and tau (AT8; green; Alexa 594) immunolabelling in control and AD cingulate cortex (a–e) and hippocampus (f–g). a) Neuritic plaque in the cingulate cortex of a late-stage AD showing the AT8-positive neurites surrounding by QA-positive cells.

QA 500 and 1200 nM significantly increased not only the level of total tau (<Figure 3A>), but also tau phosphorylation at the Tau-8 and Tau-180 epitopes (<Figure 3B and C>, respectively), as shown by the increase in the staining intensity. Cultures treated with 1200 nM QA had less DAPI-stained neurons and a lower intensity of red staining, compared to control culture and cells treated with 500 nM QA, suggesting that QA 1200 nM is neurotoxic. rhetorical Figure 3 Primary cultures of human neurons were immunostained for tau phosphorylation with three different antibodies: Line A, staining of total tau using mAb Tau 5 (Abcam); line B, staining of phosphorylated tau using mAb Tau 180 (Innogenetics); and line C, staining of phosphorylated tau using mAb Tau 8 (Innogenetics). The left column corresponds to untreated neurons, the middle column to QA 500 nM treated cells and the right column to QA 1200 nM treated cells. The histograms represent the semi-quantification of the immunostaining intensity. Intensity has been quantified using ImageJ 10.2. This experiment has been performed in triplicate with primary cultures of neurons prepared from three different brains. Three individual microscopic fields were analysed for each treatment and the SEM for the data was determined to be <5%. QA 500 and 1200 nM significantly increased not only the level of total tau (<Figure 3A>), but also tau phosphorylation at the Tau-8 and Tau-180 epitopes (<Figure 3B and C>, respectively), as shown by the increase in the staining intensity. Cultures treated with 1200 nM QA had less DAPI-stained neurons and a lower intensity of red staining, compared to control culture and cells treated with 500 nM QA, suggesting that QA 1200 nM is neurotoxic.To further elucidate the effect of QA on tau phosphorylation, human foetal neuronal cultures were treated with four different concentrations of QA for 72 hours and Western blot analyses were performed using four different phosphorylation specific antibodies. Details of the experiment are given in the <Materials and Methods> and in the figure legend. The results are shown in <Figure 4>. Okadaic acid (100 nM) was used as positive control. At this concentration okadaic acid increased tau phosphorylation with all the four antibodies studied. Phosphorylation of threonine 181 (AT270) was increased by 20%, serine 199/202 (AT8) by 450%, threonine 231(AT180) by 400% and serine 396/404 (PHF-1) by 70% over the control levels by OA. QA increased phosphorylation of serine 199/202 and threonine 231 in a dose dependent manner over the basal level of phosphorylation in the control cultures (<Figure 4>). The effect on threonine 181 and serine 396/404 was not dose dependent. Phosphorylation of threonine 181 was slightly (20%) increased by the relatively higher concentrations of QA used, whereas, phosphorylation of serine 396/404 was increased substantially by QA at concentrations of 350 nM or higher. Control cultures showed a substantially higher level of phosphorylation of T181, compared to the other sites tested (<Figure 4>), and both QA and OA resulted in a minimal increase in the phosphorylation of this site over the control level. An interesting observation was the presence of a higher molecular weight band (∼165 kDa) detected with the antibody AT270 (pT181), which may represent aggregated tau (<Figure 5>). rhetorical Figure 4 Primary human foetal neurons were cultured at a density of 1×106 cells per well in a 12-well plate in the absence or presence various concentrations of QA."

An interesting observation was the presence of a higher molecular weight band (∼165 kDa) detected with the antibody AT270 (pT181), which may represent aggregated tau (<Figure 5>). In order to investigate if the increased phosphorylation of tau was due to a decrease in the phosphatase activity of neurons, we investigated the effect of QA on phosphatase activity using pNPP as a substrate. We observed an apparent increase in total phosphatase activity at 100 nm QA, but a dose dependent decrease thereafter at higher concentrations used (<Figure 6A>). Since PP2A is the major phosphatase activity, we indirectly measured PP2A activity in the presence of 10 nM OA, and calculated the OA-inhibited (PP2A) activity. QA inhibited OA-inhibited phosphatase activity in a dose dependent manner (<Figure 6B>). To confirm these results, we immunoprecipated PP2A from the lysate onto protein A agarose beads and measured the phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitated PP2A towards pNPP. All concentrations of QA tested decreased phosphatase activity by approximately 30%. The decrease was, however, not dose dependent (<Figure 6C>). To confirm these results, and to investigate if this apparent change in phosphatase activity was due to a change in protein expression, we measured the expression levels of PP1, PP2A, PP2B and PP5 by Western blot analyses in the lysate of neurons treated with various concentrations of QA. The results are shown in <Figure 7>. As shown in <Figure 7A>, QA treatment decreased the expression of PP1 in a dose dependent manner. QA at a relatively lower concentration of 400 nM decreased PP1 expression to the same extent as achieved by 100 nM OA. A similar dose-dependent decrease in the expression of PP2A (<Figure 7B and 7C>) and PP5 (<Figure 7E>) was also observed with QA acid treatment. PP2B expression on the other hand was increased by all concentrations of QA tested (<Figure 7D>). Maximum increase (∼200% of control) was observed with 200 nM QA. OA treatment also increased PP2B expression. rhetorical Figure 6 Neuronal cultures were treated with the concentrations of QA shown, for 72 hours.

PP2B expression on the other hand was increased by all concentrations of QA tested (<Figure 7D>). Maximum increase (∼200% of control) was observed with 200 nM QA. OA treatment also increased PP2B expression.These results strongly support the hypothesis that the excitotoxin QA induces tau phosphorylation by inhibiting the activity and/or expression of multiple serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A and PP5). Our data also suggest that the apparent observed increase in total phosphatase activity in the neuronal lysate treated with relatively lower concentrations of QA (up to 200 nM) may be due to an increase in PP2B expression and/or activity. Since QA is an NMDA receptor agonist, we investigated the effect of other NMDA receptor agonists (glutamate and NMDA) on tau phosphorylation and tested whether the NMDA receptor antagonists can abrogate QA-induced tau phosphorylation. The results are shown in <Figure 8>. NMDA receptor agonists, glutamate and NMDA at equimolar concentrations (500 nM) increased tau phosphorylation at serine 199/202 (AT8) and threonine 231 (AT-180), similar to QA. Phosphorylation of tau at the AT8 site by QA was inhibited by memantine (500 nM) but not by AP-5 or MK-801. The combination of all the three antagonists (cocktail) inhibited tau phosphorylation to some degree but not to the extent of inhibition by memantine alone. Phosphorylation at the AT-180 site was inhibited by memantine and MK-801 but not by AP-5. The antagonist cocktail was less effective in inhibiting phosphorylation of threonine 231 than memantine or MK-801 alone. These results suggest that QA-induced tau phosphorylation involve NMDA receptor activation and inhibiting the NMDA receptors by an antagonist inhibits the effect of QA on tau phosphorylation. rhetorical Figure 8 Primary cultures of human neurons were treated with 500 nM each of three NMDA receptor agonists (QA, glutamate and NMDA) and three antagonists (memantine, MK-801 and AP-5).

Genes Increase Genebank Functions Link with AD’s pathology BRCA1 (Breast cancer 1) 2.64 NM_007294 Cell cycle control. BRCA1 is a regulator of cell cycle BRCA1 is found strongly expressed in all Alzheimer’s brain specifically in neurofibrillary tangles. BRCA1 is also linked with prevalence for Alzheimer’s disease [52] . MYC (c-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene) 2.16 NM_002467 Multifunctional nuclear phosphoprotein involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation.

WNT1 (Wingless-type MMTV integration site family 1) 2.45 NM_005430 Implicated in oncogenesis, migration, adhesion and in several developmental processes, WNT1 interferes with PP2A activity leading to tau protein hyperphosphorylation.

WISP1(WNT1 inducible signalling pathway protein 1) 2.39 NM_003882 Involved in developmental processes and cell proliferation WISP1 attenuates p53-mediated apoptosis through activation of the Akt kinase. It is neuroprotective as WISP1 phosphorylates GSK-3β and maintains β-catenin to enhance neuronal survival and suppress microglial activation in AD pathogenesis [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] . CDK5 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 5) 3.71 NM_014207 Cdk5 is an atypical cyclin-dependent kinase localized in the brain CDK5 is involved in the regulation of tau phosphorylation [58] .

Polymorphism of these genes is associated with Alzheimer's disease. IL1-α induces tau phosphorylation in human astrocytes [59] . NOS2A (Nitric oxide synthase 2A) 4.29 NM_000625 Commonly known as iNOS, it is inducible by LPS and inflammatory cytokines. NOS2A/iNOS protein level is significantly increased in AD patients leading to oxidative stress. NO triggers tau hyperphosphorylation in hippocampal neurons. iNOS immunoreactive profiles were detected associated with senile plaques and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles [ 60 ] , [ 61 ] . C/EBPB (CCAAT/ enhancer binding proteinβ) 2.38 NM_005194 The C/EBP is implicated in cellular injury and regeneration in neuron. C/EBP has been reported to be up regulated in AD.

Leptin dysregulation is associated with enhanced susceptibility of neurons to damage and it has been found to be neuroprotective in neurodegenerative brain regions [66] . We investigated the expression of genes related to several signalling pathways in neuronal cultures treated with QA for 24 hours. Of the 84 genes tested, QA induced the expression of 10 genes (<Figure 9> and <Table 2>) by more than two-fold over the control cultures. All these 10 genes are linked with AD pathology and 6 are known to be involved in tau phosphorylation. Details of the over-expressed genes and their reported roles in AD pathology, tau phosphorylation and neuroprotection are given in <Table 2>. We previously found that QA accumulates in AD brain and interestingly was seen in dystrophic hippocampal neurons <[15]>. We confirm this here and show co-localization with HPT in cortical and hippocampal neurons. QA is also seen in non-neuronal cells (microglia), which is likely to be the source for neuronal uptake. The present study was designed to assess the potential effect of QA on tau phosphorylation. In accord with our hypothesis, we demonstrated that QA increases tau phosphorylation and so is likely to be a critical factor involved in NFTs formation and subsequent neuronal death. Ultimately, QA accumulation could lead to a worsening of AD neuropathogenesis.Tau is a phosphoprotein that can be phosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine residues. Hyperphosphorylated tau is assembled into paired helical filaments (PHF) leading to the formation of NFTs<[11]>. At least thirty serine/threonine phosphorylation sites have been identified in abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau from AD brain<[20]>. Mechanisms of tau hyperphosphorylation are still not fully understood. Tau hyperphosphorylation results in the disruption and disassembly of the microtubules and subsequently in neuronal death and memory loss<[21]>. The neuronal disruption of microtubules by hyperphosphorylated tau, which accumulates as PHF in NFTs, is one of the key features of AD<[8]>, <[22]>.Several neuroinflammatory mediators are able to activate the KP leading to the production of QA by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages<[4]>. Microglial activation is known to occur early in transgenic models of tauopathies and immuno-suppression attenuates tau pathology<[23]>, providing a potential corroborating link between microglial products and tangle formation. Interestingly, other excitotoxins such as kainic acid are also able to increase formation of PHF protein<[24]>. QA is an NMDA receptor agonist and represents a potent endogenous excitotoxin. Increases in QA concentration are known to be associated with several neurodegenerative diseases<[4]>, <[7]>, <[25]>. We previously reported the presence of QA in close proximity to NFTs and we also observed that QA accumulates in vacuoles within the cytoplasm of dystrophic neurons. We showed here that QA and NFTs are often co-localized in the brain of AD patients<[15]>, <[26]>. We found that in vitro human primary neurons can take up exogenous QA (see supplementary <Figure S1>) but can only catabolize a limited amount<[16]>. This is likely to be due to a rapid saturation of the catabolising enzyme for QA, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) (EC 2.4.2.19) (<Figure 1>) (see supplementary <Figure S2>). We demonstrated that neuronal QPRTase activity begins to be saturated at QA concentrations≥300 nM. Neurons can take up and catabolise QA to produce more NAD+
<[27]>, which would provide more energy to the cell and improve DNA repair<[28]>."
PMC2709912_6,"The excessive accumulation of QA is likely to induce a cytotoxic cascade within neurons<[15]>, <[26]> Taken together these observations led us to investigate whether elevated concentrations of QA may contribute to AD neuropathology by leading to tau hyperphosphorylation. We found that in vitro QA treatment of human primary foetal neurons led to a substantial increase of tau phosphorylation at multiple positions. Sites S199/202, T231 and S396/404 are more sensitive to phosphorylation induced by QA treatment. T181 showed a higher degree of phosphorylation in the control cultures and phosphorylation at this site was not substantially increased by QA treatment. However, QA treatment increased the appearance of a high molecular band (∼165 kDa) detected with antibody AT270, which recognizes pT181. This suggests that QA-induced phosphorylation at this site may increase the aggregation of tau. It has been suggested that phosphorylation of tau at S199, S202, T205, T212, S235, S262 and S404 is required for the sequestration of normal tau, whereas further phosphorylation at positions T231 and S396 is needed for self-assembly. Phosphorylation at T181 and T217 are also suggested to be involved in self-assembly<[29]>. Whether other serine or threonine residues that are usually phosphorylated in ADP-tau are also phosphorylated by QA treatment remains to be investigated.The alternative splicing of the tau gene produces six isoforms of tau in adult brain. The six isoforms of tau differ from each other by the presence or absence of one or two inserts in the N-terminal part and by the presence of either three or four repeats in the C-terminal region. Whereas all six isoforms are seen in adult brain, only the shortest isoform of tau is expressed in foetal brain <[20]>. Although we tested the effect of QA on foetal tau phosphorylation, our results can be extrapolated to adult tau for two reasons. Firstly, about one third of total tau in adult brain is the shortest (foetal) isoform (0N/3R)<[20]>; and secondly, most of the phosphorylation sites in PHF-tau are also phosphorylated in foetal brain tau<[30]>, <[31]>, <[32]>. In the AD brain, tau can be hyperphosphorylated by either an increase in the activities of one or more serine/threonine kinases or reduced activity of a phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl protein phosphatase(s). The role of the kinases in tau hyperphosphorylation has been well studied but increase in activity of any one of these kinases has never been reproducibly shown in AD brain. Phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl protein phosphatases are among the major regulators of the phosphorylation of tau<[33]>, <[34]>, <[35]>. Impairment of protein phosphatases not only directly affects the dephosphorylation of tau but may also up-regulate the activity of some protein kinases, which are phosphorylation dependent<[35]>, <[36]>, <[37]>
<[38]>
<[39]>
<[40]>.The major serine/threonine phosphatases in the brain are PP1, PP2A and PP2B<[41]>, <[42]>, <[43]>, <[44]>. Although quantitatively PP2B is the most abundantly expressed in the brain, it represents, due to specific activity, a small proportion of total brain phosphatases activity; PP1 and PP2A together account for over 90% of the total mammalian brain protein phosphatase activity, and any alteration in the activity of these two phosphatases may significantly affect the phosphorylation state of tau. A decrease of about 20% in the activities of PP1 and PP2A has been reported in AD brain<[45]>, <[46]>. The observed increase in QA-induced phosphorylation of tau could be due to a decrease in the expression or activity of the major tau phosphatases. We measured total and OA-inhibited (PP2A) phosphatase activity in QA-treated neuronal lysate. We also measured the activity of immunoprecipitated PP2A from QA-treated neuronal lysate. We observed a biphasic effect on total phosphatase activity, using pNPP as substrate. The activity was increased at 100 nM QA but higher concentrations decreased the activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, PP2A activity (measured indirectly as OA-inhibited phosphatase activity and directly by immunoprecipitating PP2A and measuring its activity) was markedly decreased in a dose dependent manner.We measured the expression level of PP1, PP2A, PP2B and PP5. QA treatment decreased the expression of PP1, PP2A and PP5 in a dose dependent manner. These data suggest that the observed reduction in phosphatase activity and subsequent tau phosphorylation is due to a decrease in the expression of the major tau phosphatases. The expression of PP2B, on the other hand, was markedly increased. The observed increase in total phosphatase activity with lower concentrations of QA (100–200 nM) could be due to an increase in PP2B activity. Liu et al. <[44]> have reported that PP2A, PP1, PP5 and PP2B account for ∼71%, ∼11%, ∼10% and ∼7%, respectively, of the total tau phosphatase activity of human brain. Increased expression of PP2B could be a compensatory mechanism for the substantial decrease in PP2A and PP1 activities. Our results are in accordance with the published literature reporting the increased expression of PP2B in AD brain, which is characterized by tau hyperphosphorylation. Up-regulation of PP2B expression in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampus in AD brain has been previously reported<[47]>. An increase in the catalytic cleavage and subsequent increase in the activity of PP2B in AD brain has also been reported<[44]>.Since QA is an NMDA receptor agonist, we investigated whether other agonists had a similar effect on tau phosphorylation. Both glutamate and NMDA increased tau phosphorylation at sites similar to QA. An increase in tau phosphorylation by glutamate has been reported previously<[48]>. We also studied the effects of various NMDA receptor antagonists on QA-induced tau phosphorylation. Of the antagonists studied, only memantine almost completely reversed QA-induced tau phosphorylation. MK-801 inhibited tau phosphorylation at AT-180 site but not at AT8 site, whereas, AP-5 had no effect at either site. Inhibition of okadaic acid-induced tau phosphorylation to the control level by memantine but not by other antagonists (5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (DK) or with D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP) in organotypic cultures of rat hippocampal slices has been reported by Li et al.52 and this observation is consistent with our findings. In this study memantine also reversed the OA-induced decrease in PP-2A activity, increase in calcium, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and cyclin AMP-dependent PKA activities, the decrease and aggregation of MAP-2 and the phosphorylation and aggregation of neurofilament heavy/medium (NF-H/M) subunits and inhibited the neurodegeneration associated with these changes. Memantine is a low to moderate affinity non-competitive NMDA receptor channel blocker that leads to functional improvement and reduces care dependence in moderate to severe AD patients<[49]>, <[50]>. The NMDA receptor has been reported to be associated with PP-2A and stimulation of this receptor can lead to the dissociation of PP-2A from the complex and the reduction of PP-2A activity in cultured cells<[51]>. It has been suggested that, in addition to its activity as an NMDA receptor antagonist, the effects of memantine might involve modulation of PP-2A signalling, a property not shared by the other NMDA receptor antagonists<[48]>.Finally, we used PCR array to determine which of the genes associated with tau phosphorylation may be switched on by QA. We found that QA at the sub-physiological concentrations found in amyloid plaques<[26]> was able to activate 10 genes in primary human neurons (<Fig. 10>; <table 2>). Six of these genes e.g. CDK5, MYC, WNT1, IL1α, iNOS and BRCA1 are associated with intracellular pathways known to play a role in tau phosphorylation (<Table 2>). The other genes WISP1, LEP, C/EBPB and CSF2 are known to be associated with neuroprotective mechanisms and are logically activated in response to QA. rhetorical Figure 10 We previously found that QA accumulates in AD brain and interestingly was seen in dystrophic hippocampal neurons <[15]>."

We propose that a decrease in major tau phosphatases (PP2A, PP1 and PP5) is a mechanism for this increased in tau phosphorylation in neurons exposed to QA at pathophysiological concentrations. This study has identified a new mechanism involved in AD neurodegeneration and may open a new therapeutic avenue for treatment of AD. Some of the tryptophan catabolites produced through the kynurenine pathway (KP), and more particularly the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA), are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that the KP is over activated in AD brain and that QA accumulates in amyloid plaques and within dystrophic neurons. We hypothesized that QA in pathophysiological concentrations affects tau phosphorylation. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that QA is co-localized with hyperphosphorylated tau (HPT) within cortical neurons in AD brain. We then investigated in vitro the effects of QA at various pathophysiological concentrations on tau phosphorylation in primary cultures of human neurons. Using western blot, we found that QA treatment increased the phosphorylation of tau at serine 199/202, threonine 231 and serine 396/404 in a dose dependent manner. Increased accumulation of phosphorylated tau was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. This increase in tau phosphorylation was paralleled by a substantial decrease in the total protein phosphatase activity. A substantial decrease in PP2A expression and modest decrease in PP1 expression were observed in neuronal cultures treated with QA. These data clearly demonstrate that QA can induce tau phosphorylation at residues present in the PHF in the AD brain. To induce tau phosphorylation, QA appears to act through NMDA receptor activation similar to other agonists, glutamate and NMDA. The QA effect was abrogated by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Using PCR arrays, we found that QA significantly induces 10 genes in human neurons all known to be associated with AD pathology. Of these 10 genes, 6 belong to pathways involved in tau phosphorylation and 4 of them in neuroprotection. Altogether these results indicate a likely role of QA in the AD pathology through promotion of tau phosphorylation. Understanding the mechanism of the neurotoxic effects of QA is essential in developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD. ."
PMC5543054_0,"Dual-specificity tyrosine–phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is localized in the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. As a candidate gene responsible for learning defects associated with Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), DYRK1A has been implied to play pivotal roles in cell proliferation and brain development. MEF2D, a member of the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors, was proved to be in control of neuronal cell differentiation and development. Here we demonstrated that MEF2D could upregulate DYRK1A gene expression through specific activation of DYRK1A isoform 5 gene transcription. A MEF2D responsive element from −268 to −254 bp on promoter region of DYRK1A isoform 5 was identified and confirmed by luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The coordinated expression of DYRK1A and MEF2D in mouse brain development indicated a possibility of the cross-interaction of these two genes during neurodevelopment. The DYRK1A kinase activity was also affected by MEF2D’s transcriptional regulation of DYRK1A. Therefore, the molecular regulation of DYRK1A by MEF2D further supported their involvement in neurodevelopment. This study was supported by grants from NSFC (81371226) and the Outstanding Scientist of Shandong (JQ201421). Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21<1>. DS is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities in newborns, accounting about 10 per 10,000 live births<2>, <3>. DYRK1A, localized in the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21, is considered to be a strong candidate gene for intellectual disability related to DS. DYRK1A was first discovered as minibrain (mnb) gene and could cause an abnormal spacing of neuroblasts in the outer proliferation center of larval brain in Drosophila. These flies exhibit a specific and smaller size of optic lobes and central brain hemispheres. This phenotype indicates a possible function of DYRK1A in regulating neurogenesis<4>. The level of DYRK1A protein gradually decreased with postnatal growth<5>. Several mice models showed that Dyrk1a transgene could lead to neurodevelopmental delay, motor abnormalities, mental retardation, learning and memory deficit and reduced neuronal density<6>–<8>, which could also be observed in DS patients<9>–<11>. Overexpression of Dyrk1a might inhibit neural cell proliferation and promote premature neuronal differentiation in the developing cerebral cortex without affecting cell fate and layer positioning<12>, and cause the defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis as well<13>.As a transcription factor, MEF2D is initially identified to be critical for muscle cell differentiation<14>. Myocyte-specific enhance factor 2 (MEF2) family members are involved in control of not only muscle but also neuronal cell differentiation and neurodevelopment<15>. Research has revealed that MEF2 was selectively expressed in newly generated postmitotic neurons and was required for the survival of these neurons. Once activated, MEF2 regulated neuronal survival by stimulating MEF2-dependent gene transcription<16>. MEF2 transcription factors are also highly expressed in neurons and are critical determinants of neuronal differentiation and fate<17>. As a member of MEF2 family, MEF2D is concerned to be involved in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation and survival.Alternative splicing of DYRK1A mRNA generates more than five transcript variants differing either in the 5′ UTR or in the 3′ coding region<18>. Our recent study showed that DYRK1A isoform 3 gene transcription is regulated by RE1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST) in neurodevelopment in mice and DYRK1A dosage imbalance destabilizes REST protein and reduced its transcriptional activity, thus forming a negative feedback loop in regulation of DYRK1A transcription by REST<19>. We also found that DYRK1A is degraded by E3 ligase SCFβ-TRCP and is essential for cell cycle progression<20>, <21>. However, the molecular mechanism of DYRK1A transcription during neurodevelopment remained unknown. Here we further elucidate the molecular mechanism of DYRK1A gene transcription. Our data showed that DYRK1A isoform 5 transcription was up-regulated by MEF2D in brain glioblastoma T98G cells. A MEF2D responsive element was identified and functionally analysed in the DYRK1A promoter region between −268 to −254 bp. We also demonstrated that DYRK1A and MEF2D are coordinately expressed in mouse brain during neurodevelopment. The upregulation of DYRK1A by MEF2D increased DYRK1A kinase activity. These results indicated a novel regulatory mechanism for DYRK1A by MEF2D. Human DYRK1A gene has nine transcripts that encode for four consensus CDS (ensemble GRCh38.p7). Four consensus CDS of DYRK1A were selected for comparison and analysis (Fig. <1A>). DYRK1A isoform 1 (NCBI NM_001396.3) encodes the full length protein while isoform 5 (NCBI NM_130438.2) encodes a shorter protein different in 3′ coding region. We previously cloned and characterized the promoter for DYRK1A isoform 3<19>. The 5′ UTR and exon 1 for isoform 3 and isoform 5 are totally different. Therefore, we propose that there are at least two alternative promoters to regulate the different transcript variants of DYRK1A gene. To examine if MEF2D regulated DYRK1A gene transcription, RT-PCR was performed to analyze the transcription of three isoforms of DYRK1A and total DYRK1A in T98G cells transfected with MEF2D expression vector (Fig. <1B>). Total DYRK1A was amplified using a pair of primers spanning from exon 4 to exon 6 of isoform 1 to detect DYRK1A gene expression. The result showed that mRNA expression of total DYRK1A and DYRK1A isoform 5 was significantly elevated with MEF2D overexpression compared with control. MEF2D overexpression increased total DYRK1A expression to 2.3 ± 0.03 folds and DYRK1A isoform 5 expression to 2.7 ± 0.05 folds compared to controls (Fig. <1C>). Real time fluorescence PCR also showed that total DYRK1A and DYRK1A isoform 5 mRNA levels were markedly elevated by MEF2D overexpression to 145% ± 11.67 and 145% ± 3.67 of controls (Fig. <1D>). Endogenous MEF2D and DYRK1A isoform 5 were detected at protein levels in HEK293 and T98G cells to ensure they are expressed together physiologically (Fig. <1E>). These results demonstrated that DYRK1A gene expression could be up-regulated by MEF2D. MEF2D did not regulate the gene expression of DYRK1A isoform 2 and 3, indicating there is an alternative promoter for DYRK1A isoform 5. rhetorical Figure 1 MEF2D regulates DYRK1A gene transcription in T98G cells.

Previous research has revealed that truncated DYRK1A elevated its kinase activity and increased the ability to phosphorylate its substrate<23>. Transcription factor NFATc2 was a known substrate of DYRK1A and phosphorylation of NFATc2 by DYRK1A decreased NFATc2 protein expression<24>. To investigate if transcriptional regulation of DYRK1A isoform 5 by MEF2D affected DYRK1A kinase activity, T98G cells were co-transfected with MEF2D and NFATc2 expression vectors. We found that MEF2D overexpression markedly decreased NFATc2 expression to 46 ± 0.4% of control while elevated DYRK1A isoform 5 expression to 122 ± 0.1% of control (Fig. <6A>) at protein levels (Fig. <6A>). DYRK1A overexpression also greatly reduced NFATc2 protein expression to 41 ± 1.5% of control in T98G cells (Fig. <6C and D>). These results implied that the DYRK1A kinase activity might be increased by MEF2D (Fig. <6A and B>). These results showed that MEF2D not only regulates the DYRK1A gene transcription, but also its kinase activity. rhetorical Figure 6 MEF2D regulates DYRK1A kinase activity exemplified by NFATc2 protein expression.

These results implied that the DYRK1A kinase activity might be increased by MEF2D (Fig. <6A and B>). These results showed that MEF2D not only regulates the DYRK1A gene transcription, but also its kinase activity. Here our study showed that MEF2D could up-regulate the transcription of total DYRK1A and DYRK1A isoform 5 through binding to a specific DY-MRE at −268 bp to −254 bp at DYRK1A isoform 5 gene promoter region. As a transcription factor, MEF2D binds to sequence-specific DNA and regulates neuronal cell differentiation and development<25>–<27>. DYRK1A was also proved to play critical roles in regulating cell cycle exit and differentiation<28>–<31>. Our studies here elucidated the molecular mechanism of DYRK1A isoform 5 gene transcription by MEF2D, further supporting the significant roles of both of them in neurodevelopment.We previously identified an alternative promoter for DYRK1A isoform 3 that is regulated by REST in neurodevelopment<19>. Compared to the high GC content of isoform 3 promoter, the promoter identified here for isoform 5 did not contain a GC-rich element. Our results also showed distinct regulation of these two alternative promoters as MEF2D specifically regulates isoform 5 gene transcription while it has no effect on isoform 3 expression. Alternative usage of two promoters would contribute to the time- and tissue- specific expression of different DYRK1A variants. The exon 1 for the four isoforms of DYRK1A are all different, implying there may be four alternative promoters for each isoform. Future studies will be needed to characterize the promoters for DYRK1A isoform 1 and 2. There have been few studies on the context-dependent expression of DYRK1A different isoforms. Our and others’ studies showed the dosage of DYRK1A is critical to cellular functions as both overexpression and downexpression may lead to severe diseases, implicating the strict regulation of DYRK1A gene transcription is vital to cell fate and functions. It would be interesting to study the different activation of these two alternative promoters in different tissues and contexts.DYRK1A has more than five different isoforms that differ with each other from 5′ UTR and 3′ coding region."
PMC5543054_4,"Although encoding a 234aa shorter isoform which lacks the poly-His domain and having a different C-terminus comparing with the longest isoform 1, DYRK1A isoform 5 may still function similar as DYRK1A isoform 1/2 because it contains both nuclear localization signal and protein kinase domain  Previous research has revealed that Dyrk1a might be proteolyzed into the AD-like truncated forms, which lead to a significant increase of its kinase activity in vitro
<23>. They found that the proteolysis of Dyrk1A elevated its kinase activity and increased the ability to phosphorylate Tau in a site-specific manner. According to their results, Dyrk1a truncations molecular weights ranged from 37 kDa to 70 kDa. DYRK1A isoform 5 was 529aa, which might be detected as one of the DYRK1A truncations. It would be interesting to investigate the different kinase activities of different DYRK1A isoforms in the future study.It was reported that DYRK1A phosphorylated APP at Thr668 and increased Aβ production<32>. DYRK1A also phosphorylated Tau at Thr-212 in vitro, a residue that is phosphorylated in filamentous Tau from AD brain<33>. DYRK1A was also proved to phosphorylate Tau at Ser-202 and Ser-404 in both mammalian cells and DYRK1A transgenic mice, leading to disability of Tau to promote microtubule assembly<34>. Dyrk1A overexpression also leads to increase of 3R-tau expression and cognitive deficits in Ts65Dn Down syndrome mice<35>. As DYRK1A is involved in Aβ production and Tau phosphorylation in AD pathology, elevated expression of DYRK1A by MEF2D might contribute to AD pathogenesis<23>, <36>.In early chicken embryos, Dyrk1A is expressed before the onset of neurogenesis in neuroepithelia of the neural tube, neural crest and cranial placodes<22>. Dyrk1A is also proved to be specifically expressed in four sequential developments phases: transient expression in preneurogenic progenitors, cell cycle-regulated expression in neurogenic progenitors, transient expression in recently born neurons, and persistent expression in late differentiating neurons<37>. These results indicate that DYRK1A plays a pivotal role in mouse brain development. We have defined that MEF2D and DYRK1A are coordinately expressed in mouse brain during neurodevelopment. It elucidates a new regulating mechanism of DYRK1A in embryonic brain development and further enriches the evidence of DYRK1A participation in mouse brain neurogenesis. pCMV6-entry-MEF2D construct (RC208748, Origene Co., Beijing, China); pCMV6-entry-DYRK1A construct (RC213183, Origene Co., Beijing, China); NFATc2 expression vector (#11100, Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA); pGL3-basic vector (E1751, Promega, Madison, WI, USA); Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (CM15019, MACGENE, Beijing, China); penicillin and streptomycin (C0222, Beyotime); Fetal bovine serum (10099141, ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA); Opti-MEM (51985042, ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA); LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (11668019, ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA); Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit (17–371, Milllipore, Darmstadt, Germany); Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (DP304–02, TIANGEN, Beijing, China); Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (E1910, Promega, Wisconsin, USA); Odyssey EMSA Buffer Kit (ABIN2169587, Li-cor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA); HeLaScribe® Nuclear Extract, Gel Shift Assay Grade (E3521, Promega, Madison, WI, USA); TRI reagent (T9424,Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA); SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (QPK-201,Toyobo, Japan); MEF2D monoclonal antibody (610774, BD, San Jose, CA, USA); NFATc2 monoclonal Antibody (MA1–025, ThermoFisher, Waltham, USA); HA-probe antibody (Y-11, SC-805, santa cruz, California, USA); mouse (C56BL6, Shandong university, china); anti-flag monoclonal antibody (F1804, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA); β-actin monoclonal antibody (SAB1403520; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA); anti-DYRK1A antibody (ab156818, Abcam, Shanghai, China); IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Mouse IgG (925–32210, Licor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA); IRDye® 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (925–68070, Licor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA).

PMC5543054_5,"The association of endogenous MEF2D with DYRK1A promoter in nuclear extraction was confirmed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (#17–371, Millipore) following the manufacturer’s protocol The sense sequences of DYRK1A MRE, mutant DYRK1A MRE, consensus MEF2 and mutant MEF2 oligonucleotides were 5′-GACAATTGAATATATTTTATATATAGTTGATT-3′, 5′-GACAATTGAATATATTTCGGCCGTAGTTGATT-3′, 5′-CGGATCGCTCTAAAAATAACCCTGTCG-3′, and 5′-CGGATCGCTCGAAACGCGACCCTGTCG-3′, respectively  DYRK1A MRE (DY-MRE) and consensus MEF2 oligonucleotides were both end-labled with IRDye® 700 (Bioneer) to generate double-stranded probes. ChIP experiments were performed following protocols of the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit. HEK293 cells were cross-linked by formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) for 10 min at 37 °C, and then washed by cold PBS twice. The cells were lysed by 100μl 1% SDS lysis buffer and sheared by sonication. Proteins and DNA were pulled down with MEF2D monoclonal antibody (610774, BD, San Jose, CA, USA). Anti-RNA Polymerase II was used as a positive control and normal mouse IgG as a negative control. The primers for ChIP-PCR were: 5′-TTTTCCGTGGTAATAGGCA-3′ and 5′-CTTCAATAATCAAAATCAAC-3′. Products of ChIP-PCR were separated on a 2% agarose gel. Immunoprecipitation of ChIP proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-MEF2D. HEK293 cells were harvested in 48 hours after transfection. Dual luciferase assays were achieved following the protocol supplied by dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, E1910) as previously described<39>. All of the experiments were repeated more than three times. For immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real time RT-PCR, one representative picture is shown; quantifications are from more than three independent experiments. The values represent the means ± S.E. The data were evaluated for statistical significance with analysis of variance or Student’s t test analysis. All the P-values had been shown in figure legends. Differences were classified as significant at P < 0.05. Dual-specificity tyrosine–phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is localized in the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. As a candidate gene responsible for learning defects associated with Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), DYRK1A has been implied to play pivotal roles in cell proliferation and brain development. MEF2D, a member of the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors, was proved to be in control of neuronal cell differentiation and development. Here we demonstrated that MEF2D could upregulate DYRK1A gene expression through specific activation of DYRK1A isoform 5 gene transcription. A MEF2D responsive element from −268 to −254 bp on promoter region of DYRK1A isoform 5 was identified and confirmed by luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The coordinated expression of DYRK1A and MEF2D in mouse brain development indicated a possibility of the cross-interaction of these two genes during neurodevelopment. The DYRK1A kinase activity was also affected by MEF2D’s transcriptional regulation of DYRK1A. Therefore, the molecular regulation of DYRK1A by MEF2D further supported their involvement in neurodevelopment. ."
