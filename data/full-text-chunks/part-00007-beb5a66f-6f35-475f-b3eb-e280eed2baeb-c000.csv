PMC4311138_0,"Tau is the major microtubule-associated protein in neurons involved in microtubule stabilization in the axonal compartment. Changes in tau gene expression, alternative splicing and posttranslational modification regulate tau function and in tauopathies can result in tau mislocalization and dysfunction, causing tau aggregation and cell death. To uncover proteins involved in the development of tauopathies, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for tau-interacting proteins. We show that axotrophin/MARCH7, a RING-variant domain containing protein with similarity to E3 ubiquitin ligases interacts with tau. We defined the tau binding domain to amino acids 552–682 of axotrophin comprising the RING-variant domain. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization confirmed the specificity of the interaction. Intracellular localization of axotrophin is determined by an N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal nuclear export signal. In AD brain nuclear localization is lost and axotrophin is rather associated with neurofibrillary tangles. We find here that tau becomes mono-ubiquitinated by recombinant tau-interacting RING-variant domain, which diminishes its microtubule-binding. In vitro ubiquitination of four-repeat tau results in incorporation of up to four ubiquitin molecules compared to two molecules in three-repeat tau. In summary, we present a novel tau modification occurring preferentially on 4-repeat tau protein which modifies microtubule-binding and may impact on the pathogenesis of tauopathies. We search for tau-interacting proteins using a cytotrap yeast two-hybrid assay. MARCH7 was identified as a tau-binding protein and confirmed by several methods. Recombinant MARCH7 Ring-variant domain uses Ubc5 for E3 self-ubiquitinating activity. MARCH7 Ring-variant domain mono-ubiquitinates tau protein at multiple sites including the microtubule-binding domain. Mono-ubiquitination of tau protein diminishes its microtubule-binding.

We also thank S Rossner and T Bullmann for critically reading the manuscript. This work was supported, in part, by the   (HO2368/4-1) and by EU funds (EFRE) of the   (SAB, 100111005). Tau protein belongs to the family of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it is enriched in axons. Tau protein binds to microtubules and promotes their assembly and stabilization. Different tau isoforms generated by alternative splicing display variable microtubule binding capacities. In the human brain six isoforms of tau protein, that arise from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10, are found <[1]>. Exon 10 encodes a microtubule binding repeat in the C-terminus in addition to three microtubule binding repeats existing in all tau isoforms. Exons 2 and 3 encode N-terminal insertions. Over 30 potential phosphorylation sites are identified in the tau molecule. Most of these phosphorylation sites are located in the flanking regions around the microtubule binding repeats and affect microtubule binding <[2]>, <[3]>.Tau pathology is a defining feature in several neuropathological disorders called tauopathies <[4]>. They are characterized by tau aggregation into abnormal, beta-sheet containing filaments (PHFs) in neural cells and accompanied by a loss of axonal subcellular tau compartmentalization, by tau hyperphosphorylation and by changes in other posttranslational modifications. Whereas most tauopathies such as Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not linked to mutations, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the MAPT gene <[4]>.Tau protein in its natively unfolded form is hydrophilic, highly soluble and degraded in an ubiquitin independent manner by the core (20S) of proteasome <[5]>, <[6]>. The molecular incident responsible for triggering tau aggregation in sporadic tauopathies is unknown. The tau protein amino acid (aa) sequences most prone to convert into beta-sheet have been identified in the PHF6 and PHF6* sequence <[7]>. It is assumed that alterations in charge distribution in these amino acids may play a role in transition to a secondary structure.Recent studies implicate that in addition to the tau protein expression level and turnover aberrant posttranslational modifications of tau protein such as phosphorylation <[8]>, O-GlcNAc glycosylation <[9]> and oxidation <[10]> are involved in initiating tau aggregation. Protein–protein interaction that can induce secondary structure elements in natively unfolded proteins may also be a candidate for tau beta-sheet formation and tau aggregation. Further, deficiencies in the cytoplasmic chaperone system such as heat-shock protein function of hsp70/90 <[11]> and peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase activity of Pin1 have been implicated in tau pathology <[12]>, <[13]>.For a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind tau pathology we screened for tau protein interaction partners, which may affect tau conformation or posttranslational modification. Using a cytoplasmic interaction screen we identified axotrophin also named MARCH7 as tau-interacting protein. Axotrophin belongs to the family of membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins, although no transmembrane domains for axotrophin are recognizable <[14]>.Human axotrophin comprises a C4HC3-RING-variant domain in the C-terminal region similar to zinc binding RING domains of some ubiquitin ligases, also called E3 ligases <[15]>. Axotrophin is enriched in stem cells, neuronal cells and spermatids <[14]>, <[16]>, <[17]>. Axotrophin null mice are viable and fertile but show premature neuronal degeneration and defective development of the corpus callosum <[18]>. Axotrophin is functionally linked to the proteins Foxp3 and leukemia inhibitory factor. Thereby, axotrophin is believed to have an influence on T cell replication and immunotolerance with increased axotrophin expression in immunotolerance <[19]>, <[20]>.Ubiquitination requires the concerted activity of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. Ubiquitin is activated by ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), and then transferred to an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) via thioester linkage. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for specificity in substrate recognition either functioning solely as a scaffolding protein or additionally as a carrier of the activated ubiquitin. Ubiquitination of substrates can initiate a variety of downstream processes.Poly-ubiquitination with a K48 linkage is the canonical pathway for proteasomal degradation of cytoplasmic proteins. Mono- or di-ubiquitination can induce internalization and trafficking, transcription and signal transduction depending on the ubiquitin linkage and length of the ubiquitin chain <[21]>, <[22]>.For neurodegenerative diseases like AD there is evidence that the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of proteins is disturbed: 1) inclusions of aggregated and ubiquitinated protein are found <[23]>; 2) proteasome activity in AD brains is lower than in age-matched controls <[24]>, <[25]> and 3) mutations in enzymes of the ubiquitination cascade and ubiquitin are known to appear in neurodegenerative diseases <[26]>, <[27]>, <[28]>.The aims of this study are (i) the characterization of axotrophin regarding its subcellular localization and (ii) its potential E3 activity and (iii) the investigation of the tau axotrophin interaction with tau as a presumable substrate of axotrophin. The pGex-6P1 plasmid was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The pEGFPC2 and the pDSRed2 plasmid were purchased from Clontech. For PCR amplification of axotrophin and hook3 human fetal brain marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech) has been used. Other cDNAs were amplified from image clones.

PMC4311138_1,"Scheffner, Konstanz, Germany <[29]>  CytoTrap two-hybrid system (Stratagene) was used to identify new tau interacting proteins. Screening was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length human tau protein 2N4R isoform cDNA (441aa) was cloned into bait vector pSos for expression of hSos–tau fusion-protein. CytoTrap human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene) cloned into target vector pMyr was used for screening. Positive clones were sequenced. For verification and further characterization of axotrophin interactions the DupLEX yeast two-hybrid assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (OriGene). Supplemental Table I summarizes properties of the used constructs. As negative control for interaction pJG-neg plasmid was used and for positive interaction control plasmids pBait and pTarget from the DupLEX system were used. Vectors pEG-tau and pJG-axo were introduced into yeast strain EGY48 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2:6 LexAop-LEU2). After protein expression was induced by galactose cells were harvested and protein extracted in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/mL leupeptin, 5 μg/mL pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail by Roche). After pre-clearing with Protein-G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/mL leupeptin, 5 μg/mL pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, and complete) LexA–Tau fusion protein was precipitated with Protein G-coupled mouse anti-LexA Dynabeads. Beads were washed and proteins were eluted by adding SDS gel loading buffer and 5 min incubation at 95 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western Blot analysis using rabbit anti-tau antibody BR134 (1:1000) (1) and rabbit anti-AxoCT antibody, goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Chemicon) and chemiluminescence detection. Anti-AxoCT is a polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against the C-terminus of axotrophin. The antibody was raised in a rabbit by immunization with KLH-conjugated peptide ARTLQAHMEDLETSED and isolated by an affinity column harboring the immobilized peptide. Overnight colonies of Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL transformed with pGex-AxoRing (aa 549–704), pGex-AxoRingMut (aa 549–704, C552S, C555S), pGex-KLC1, pGex-PP2Ba, pGex-Hdm2 and tau plasmids prk172-ht40 (441aa, 2N4R isoform), prk172-ht46 (383aa, 0N4R isoform) or prk172-ht37 (410aa, 2N3R isoform) were inoculated into 1 L 2xTY containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol and grown at 37 °C. When OD600 reached 1.0, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 2 to 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets of cells transformed with a pGex plasmids were resuspended in 1/40 volume of PBS with 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF and 100 μM DTT. Pellets of cells transformed with a prk172 construct, expressing an isoform of human tau, were resuspended in 1/40 volume of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM DTT). Resuspended pellets were lysed via sonication. To improve solubilization of protein 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, lysozyme (4000 U/mL) and benzonase (4 U/mL) were added for 1 h, slowly shaking at 4 °C. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins KLC1, PP2Ba and Hdm2 were purified by adding glutathione-sepharose 4B to lysate supernatant for 2 h, slowly shaking at 4 °C. After washing sepharose beads several times with PBS, bound protein was cleaved from GST-tag by adding cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) containing 10 U prescission protease per mL (GE Healthcare). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (5 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM PMSF) for 4 h at 4 °C. All expressed GST axotrophin fragments led to formation of inclusion bodies and were found in the pellet after clearing the lysate by centrifugation. For purification of GST axotrophin fragments pellet was washed four times with washing buffer (2 M urea, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100). Thereafter pellet was extracted in urea buffer (7 M urea, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 50 μM ZnO(Ac)2, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5% (v/v) glycerol) for 2 h and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at room temperature. The remaining pellet after urea wash was solubilized with guanidine buffer (urea buffer with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride instead of urea) for 2 h and cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at room temperature. Guanidine hydrochloride supernatant was dialyzed against urea buffer for 4 h and pooled with urea supernatant followed by a slow sequential buffer exchange to refolding buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μM ZnO(Ac)2, 5 mM DTT). To remove precipitates, protein solution was centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. For tau protein purification a modified procedure of Yoshida and Goedert was used <[30]>. Briefly, lysis supernatant of E. coli expressing an isoform of human tau was applied to a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column (DE52, Whatman) two times. Flow through was applied to a phosphocellulose column (P11, Whatman). Phosphocellulose was washed with lysis buffer and tau protein was eluted from the column in 5 mL fractions of 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.3 M, 0.4 M and 6 × 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Cleanest fractions were pooled, adjusted to a 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate and mixed at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in dialysis buffer (5 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM PMSF). To resuspended protein 100 mM NaCl and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol were added, solution was heated to 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Tau protein containing supernatant was dialyzed against dialysis buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. Enzymes and chemicals for ubiquitination were obtained from Biomol. Ubiquitination was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with some modifications: scaling down the total reaction volume from 50 μL to 12.5 μL, using twofold volume of E3 enzyme (axotrophin) and target protein (tau, PP2Ba, KLC1) and extension of incubation time from 30–60 min to 3–4 h. Auto-ubiquitination of axotrophin was performed with each of the provided E2 enzymes and biotinylated ubiquitin without adding a target protein. Afterwards ubiquitination mixture was quenched by adding 12.5 μL 2 × non-reducing gel loading buffer and heated for 5 min to 80 °C. Tau protein ubiquitination was performed using UbcH5c as E2 enzyme, Axotrophin RING-variant domain as E3 enzyme, ubiquitin or methylated ubiquitin and biotinylated tau protein. Tau protein was biotinylated on its cysteine residue using maleimide-PEG2-biotin (Pierce). After ubiquitination tau protein was captured with magnetic streptavidin-beads and heated in 2 × non-reducing gel loading buffer for 5 min to 80 °C. The samples were separated via SDS-PAGE, blotted to PVDF membrane and analyzed by immunolabeling with peroxidase-conjugated extravidin (Sigma-Aldrich), polyclonal rabbit anti-human tau (Dako), polyclonal rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Dako) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG linked to peroxidase (GE Healthcare). For microtubule assembly cytoplasmic supernatant of tau knock-out brain <[55]> was prepared in assembly puffer (0.1 M MES pH 6.4, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, complete protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 μM UCH-L1 inhibitor, 10 μM UCH-L3 inhibitor, Calbiochem) and supplemented with 20% glycerol and 1 mM GTP. After addition of 10 μL ubiquitinated 2N4R tau (ubiquitination performed for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of the following enzymes: E1, UbcH5c, Axotrophin RING-variant domain) or 10 μL non-ubiquitinated 2N4R tau (ubiquitination mix without UbcH5c) microtubule assembly was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C."
PMC4311138_2,"Microtubules were separated from supernatant by centrifugation (30,000 ×g, 30 min, 37 °C) through sucrose cushion and subsequently washed two times with prewarmed BRB80 buffer (80 mM PIPES pH 6 8, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM GTP). Microtubule pellet was disassembled on ice in assembly buffer and boiled 5 min to remove tubulin by centrifugation. After adding 2 × gel loading buffer containing 6 M urea to assembly supernatant and heatstable microtubule pellet proteins were resolved via SDS-PAGE followed by Western Blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-human tau (Dako) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG linked to peroxidase (GE Healthcare). COS-7 and N2A cells were maintained in DMEM-Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non essential amino acids (Biochrom AG) and 50 μg/mL gentamycin (PAA Laboratories) in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C. For transfection cells were plated in DMEM-Ham's F12 supplemented with 2% FBS and non essential amino acids over night. The following axotrophin cDNA fragments cloned into the Ecl136/SalI site of pEGFPC2: axoFL (aa 1–704), axoN1 (1–625), axoN2 (1–541), axoN3 (1–344), axoC1 (333–704), axoC2 (542–704) were used. The cells were transfected with pEGFP-axotrophin constructs with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from E16 Wistar rat hippocampus using standard protocol <[31]> and cultured as described <[32]> except for seeding cells in neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM l-glutamine, 50 μg/mL gentamycin and 1% FBS for better attachment of cells. Half of the medium was renewed twice a week. After 10 days in vitro the cells were cotransfected with pRed-Tau and pEGFP-axotrophin using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cultured and transfected cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% saccharose for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclei of transfected COS-7, N2A and rat primary neuronal cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Molecular Probes). Fluorescence localization was analyzed by laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany). Human temporal cortex (Brodman area 22) and hippocampus of five control brains (age 73.6 ± 5.4 years) and five AD brains Braak stages II–VI (77.6 ± 5 years) were obtained at autopsy. The post-mortem diagnosis of AD is based on the recommendations of the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan Institute <[33]>. Human brain tissue was processed as described <[13]>. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in 1% H2O2 and non-specific binding sites were masked by 1 h incubation in a blocking solution containing 2% BSA, 1% normal donkey serum and 0.01% Triton X-100 in TBS. Free-floating sections were incubated overnight (4 °C) with 1 μg/mL anti-AxoCT antibody. Immunoreactivity was visualized using the biotin–avidin system (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit Ig, 1:1000; Amersham; streptavidin peroxidase VECTASTAIN ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Tau knock-out mice (stock no. 004779) <[55]> and human tau gene transgenic mice, expressing all human isoforms (stock no. 004808) <[56]> were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Habor), and interbred. The mice were housed on an artificial 12 h light/dark cycle under conditions of constant temperature (22 °C) and humidity (50%). Animals received water and altromin standard diet ad libitum. Sibling animals at an age of 90 days of both genotypes were used for analysis. Mouse brain tissue was processed as described <[34]> and staining procedure for human tissue was applied. Immunoreactivity in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments was semiquantitatively evaluated by measuring an optical density profile across each cell (20 cells each, on three slices) using ImageJ. The ratio of cytoplasmic versus nuclear immunoreactivity was calculated by averaging maximum grayscale in a 1 μm window in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Frozen human temporal cortices (Brodman area 22, profile of cases see Suppl. Table II) were homogenized in 7.5 vol/g cytoplasmic extraction buffer (DPBS pH 7.4 supplemented with, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 25 mM NaF, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.5 mM calpain inhibitor I and complete protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) using an ULTRA-TURRAX and cooling on ice. Cytoplasmic supernatant was obtained from a 60 min 100,000 g centrifugation step at 4 °C and mixed with glycerol to yield 10% final concentration and stored at − 80 °C. The pellet was re-extracted with 2 vol. using a high-salt buffer (1.3 M LiCl, 30 mM LiCO3, 5 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, supplemented with the same components like the cytoplasmic extraction buffer) with ULTRA-TURRAX homogenization. The supernatant obtained from a 60 min 100,000 g centrifugation step at 4 °C was mixed with glycerol to yield 10% final concentration and stored at − 80 °C. 15 μg protein was separated on each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Immunolabeling was processed using anti-axotrophin monoclonal antibody BB-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-actin monoclonal antibody C4 (Sigma). Band signal strength was quantified using densitometric software TINA 2.09g (Raytest). To identify tau interacting proteins, we employed the CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid assay. Unlike other yeast-based assays this test screens for interaction in the cytosolic compartment. We used the cDNA of the longest human tau isoform (2N4R isoform, 441aa) N-terminally fused to the SOS protein as a bait to screen a cDNA library constructed from human fetal brain (<Fig. 1>A). We obtained eleven positives, one of which was encoding aa 333–704 of Homo sapiens axotrophin/MARCH7 sequence (Gene ID 64844). <Fig. 1>A depicts reconstitution of the CytoTrap system with growth of yeast cells expressing SOS-tau protein and axotrophin at non-permissive temperature of 37 °C together with appropriate positive and negative controls. Sequence analysis displayed that axotrophin is a protein consisting of 704aa, comprising two main domains, a C-terminal RING-variant domain and a large N-terminal part with low sequence complexity but enriched in serine (observed frequency 20%, expected frequency 8.1% of full length axotrophin) and arginine (observed frequency 9.7%, expected frequency 4.2%). Full-length axotrophin can be found from fish to mammals (Suppl. Fig. 1). ClustalX sequence alignment reveals that the RING-variant domain is more conserved during evolution than the N-terminal serine/arginine-rich domain. In the N-terminal domain basic arginine-rich clusters such as aa 140–150, 276–300 and 391–411 have a higher degree of conservation than intervening sequences (Suppl. Fig. 1, numbering according human axotrophin sequence). rhetorical Fig. 1 Tau interaction with axotrophin in yeast two-hybrid assays. (A) Identification of axotrophin as a tau-interaction partner employing the CytoTrap interaction assay. Transformed cdc25H cells grow under selective conditions (37 °C, galactose-Leu, -Ura), when an interaction between bait and prey is present (clones 1 and 3 pSOS-tau/pMyr-Axo, clone 6 pSOS-MAFB/pMyr-MAFB positive control). All clones grow at permissive temperature (25 °C) on galactose-Leu, -Ura. Clones 1, 3: pSOS-Tau + pMyr-Axo, clone 2: pSOS-Tau + pMyr-MAFB (negative control), clones 4, 5: pSOS-MAFB + pMyr-Axo (negative control), clone 6: pSOS-MAFB + pMyr-MAFB (positive control). (B) Confirmation and domain analysis of axotrophin–tau interaction using the DupLEX two-hybrid system. Two different axotrophin constructs were used as a bait to test for interaction with the prey tau protein. The axotrophin C-terminal part (pEG-axoCT) with the RING-variant domain comprising aa 552–682 shows a strong interaction with human tau (pJG-tau) indicated by growth on leucine-deficient medium."
PMC4311138_3,"The long N-terminal part of axotrophin (pEG-axoNT) comprising aa 1–538 did not show an interaction with human tau  The prey protein hook3 was used as a negative control (pJG-neg). The positive control (pos control) was part of the DupLEX two-hybrid system displaying the interaction of the intracellular domain of the TGFβ-receptor and the FKBP18. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation of tau and axotrophin after coexpression of LexA–tau fusion protein and B42–axotrophin fusion protein in yeast cells. Tau protein from yeast lysate (Ly) was pulled down with matrix-coupled anti-LexA antibody and probed with tau antibody BR134 (left panel) in the immunoprecipitate (IP) and the supernatant after immunoprecipitation (SN). The precipitated tau fusion protein is marked with an arrow. Axotrophin immunoreactivity (right panel) was detected in the anti-tau immunoprecipitate by the polyclonal anti-AxoCT antibody (see arrow). To identify tau interacting proteins, we employed the CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid assay. Unlike other yeast-based assays this test screens for interaction in the cytosolic compartment. We used the cDNA of the longest human tau isoform (2N4R isoform, 441aa) N-terminally fused to the SOS protein as a bait to screen a cDNA library constructed from human fetal brain (<Fig. 1>A).

Full-length axotrophin can be found from fish to mammals (Suppl. Fig. 1). ClustalX sequence alignment reveals that the RING-variant domain is more conserved during evolution than the N-terminal serine/arginine-rich domain. In the N-terminal domain basic arginine-rich clusters such as aa 140–150, 276–300 and 391–411 have a higher degree of conservation than intervening sequences (Suppl. Fig. 1, numbering according human axotrophin sequence).To validate the observed interaction between tau and axotrophin and to localize interacting domains we used the DupLEX yeast two-hybrid system as an alternative system, where protein–protein interaction has to occur in the nucleus. Therefore full-length axotrophin and N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of axotrophin were cloned into bait vector as well as cDNA of the longest human tau isoform into target vector and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Since full-length axotrophin had autoactivating properties in the LexA-bait vector we tested different fragments and found that the fragments 1–538 comprising the N-terminal region (pEG-axoNT) and aa 552–682 comprising the RING-variant domain (pEG-axoCT) devoid of large acidic stretches were not autoactivating. <Fig. 1>B shows that tau protein is interacting with the 131aa RING-variant domain of axotrophin but not with the 538aa N-terminal region. This implicates that tau may be a substrate of the enzymatic activity of the RING-variant domain or a binding partner modulating interaction with E2 enzymes or other substrates.Next, using full-length axotrophin we could show in yeast extract that immunoprecipitating LexA-tau co-precipitates axotrophin (<Fig. 1>C). Generally, detection of axotrophin in yeast lysates was complicated by the short half-life due to auto-ubiquitination (12). This can be seen by the loss of axotrophin signal in the lysate before (LY) and after precipitation (SN) (<Fig. 1>C right panel). The axotrophin C4HC3-RING-variant domain occurring in E3 ubiquitin ligases suggests that axotrophin itself may act as E3 ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, we investigated the potential E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of axotrophin and its association with relevant E2 enzymes. Due to the inherent instability of axotrophin in living cells we expressed and purified recombinant axotrophin C-terminus (aa 548–704) comprising the RING-variant domain from E. coli inclusion bodies and recovered enzymatic activity by a slow protein refolding process. For reconstitution of the ubiquitin ligase cascade we had to determine which E2 enzyme is the appropriate interaction partner for axotrophin. We performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to test interaction with E2 enzymes known to interact with RING-variant domains of other MARCH proteins. Here we identified members of UbcH5-family, UbCH12 and UbcH13 as interaction partners (<Fig. 2>). Therefore, we used UbcH5c as E2 enzyme together with other components of ubiquitination cascade (Mg-ATP, E1 ligase and biotinylated-ubiquitin) and with recombinant axotrophin RING-variant domain to assay for E3 ligase activity. Auto-ubiquitination of axotrophin detected by extravidin-HRP was used as readout of ligase activity. We verified specificity of the reaction by omission of each component and mutation of the axotrophin RING-variant domain (<Fig. 3>A). The linkage of ubiquitin to wild-type axotrophin RING-variant domain does not occur if one component of the ubiquitination cascade is absent. Replacement of the two cysteines 552/555 of the CRIC motif of axotrophin with serine residues should hamper binding of one of the catalytically essential zinc ions and reduce ligase activity. Although the coordination of the second zinc is undisturbed the mutated RING-variant domain has a strongly diminished ligase activity (<Fig. 3>A, compare lane 1 and lane 6). These data reveal that axotrophin RING-variant domain acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase with the feature of auto-ubiquitination. rhetorical Fig. 2 Screening analysis of proteins interacting with the axotrophin C-terminus comprising the RING-variant domain (aa 552–682). We analyzed E2 enzymes for interaction with axotrophin and search for other interaction partners by library screening and dual interaction testing using the DupLEX two-hybrid system. The yeast cells transfected with E2 enzymes UbcH5a and UbcH5c as activation-domain fusion proteins could grow on leucine deficient medium (left panel). This points to the UbcH5 family as E2 enzymes cooperating with the potential E3 ligase axotrophin. Weaker signals were obtained for the neddylation E2 enzyme Ubc12 and the ubiquitin chain elongating enzyme Ubc13. Two different isoforms of the protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) catalytic subunit (PP2Ba, PP2Bb) and kinesin light chain (KLC1) were identified as additional proteins interacting with the RING-variant domain or its flanking sequences. The axotrophin C4HC3-RING-variant domain occurring in E3 ubiquitin ligases suggests that axotrophin itself may act as E3 ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, we investigated the potential E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of axotrophin and its association with relevant E2 enzymes. Due to the inherent instability of axotrophin in living cells we expressed and purified recombinant axotrophin C-terminus (aa 548–704) comprising the RING-variant domain from E. coli inclusion bodies and recovered enzymatic activity by a slow protein refolding process. For reconstitution of the ubiquitin ligase cascade we had to determine which E2 enzyme is the appropriate interaction partner for axotrophin. We performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to test interaction with E2 enzymes known to interact with RING-variant domains of other MARCH proteins. Here we identified members of UbcH5-family, UbCH12 and UbcH13 as interaction partners (<Fig. 2>). Therefore, we used UbcH5c as E2 enzyme together with other components of ubiquitination cascade (Mg-ATP, E1 ligase and biotinylated-ubiquitin) and with recombinant axotrophin RING-variant domain to assay for E3 ligase activity. Auto-ubiquitination of axotrophin detected by extravidin-HRP was used as readout of ligase activity."

(A) Testing of E3 auto-ubiquitinating activity of axotrophin RING-variant domain (AxoRing) by Western blotting. We used the UbcH5c E2 enzyme identified in the yeast two-hybrid assay to show that E3 auto-ubiquitinating activity of the RING-variant domain is dependent on all components of the ubiquitination cascade such as the presence of ATP, E1, E2 and ubiquitin. E3 auto-ubiquitinating activity of the axotrophin RING-variant domain is strongly diminished if the first two cysteines of the domain are substituted by serine residues (m, 552CRIC/552SRIS). The use of biotinylated ubiquitin (Bt-Ub) allowed the detection of ubiquitinated proteins by extravidin-HRP. (B) Screening for additional E2 enzymes capable to reconstitute axotrophin E3 ligase activity. In agreement with the yeast two-hybrid analysis the UbcH5 family was identified as the E2 enzymes conferring the highest enzymatic activity to axotrophin. In addition axotrophin E3 ligase activity was also dependent on UbcH6 and to a lesser extent on Ubc13, already identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis. UbcH1 had still has residual activity. *: auto-ubiquitinated axotrophin, +: ubiquitinated E2 enzymes. (C) Axotrophin RING-variant domain ubiquitinates tau in vitro. Axotrophin RING-variant domain (AxoRing) was incubated with Mg-ATP, E1, E2 UbcH5c, ubiquitin and biotinylated human tau isoforms 2N4R, 0N4R, 2N3R or two other axotrophin-interacting proteins KLC1 or PP2Ba. After separating proteins via SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting using an anti-tau, anti-KLC1 or anti-PP2B was done. Lane 1 shows that ubiquitination of the longest human tau isoform 2N4R (62 kDa) produced four additional immunoreactive bands each shifted 7–8 kDa apart in addition to the unmodified protein (asterisk). In the control reactions lacking E2 enzyme (lanes 4–6) and E3 enzyme (lane 7) tau protein isoforms run unmodified as a single band. Lane 2 shows ubiquitination of 0N4R tau isoform, inducing four additional immunoreactive bands. The unmodified 0N4R isoform in lane 5 runs at 55 kDa. Ubiquitination of the human 2N3R tau isoform (that includes the N-terminal inserts but only three instead of four C-terminal microtubule binding repeats) in lane 3 produces only two additional tau bands. The unmodified 2N3R isoform in lane 6 runs at 58 kDa. Complete ubiquitination cascade with E2 UbcH5c leads to additional tau bands above the unmodified tau band, which are shifted each by about 7–8 kDa and represent ubiquitinated tau (lanes 1–3). Employing KLC1 or PP2Ba in the ubiquitination assay as substrates does not result in ubiquitin incorporation in these axotrophin-interacting proteins (compare lanes 8 and 9 and lanes 10 and 11). Ub: ubiquitin, molecular weight is indicated left in kDa. (D) Ubiquitin chain elongation of mono-ubiquitinated tau protein by E4-ligase Ubc13/Mms2. Depletion of shifted 2N3R tau bands in the presence of Ubc13/Mms2 (compare lanes 2 and 3) and increase in high-molecular weight tau smear, which is more visible with anti-ubiquitin antibody (compare lanes 6 and 7), which preferentially labels poly-ubiquitinated tau protein. There is some polyubiquitinated tau protein in the absence of Ubc13/Mms2 (lane 6). (E) Microtubule-binding assay of ubiquitinated 2N4R-tau. 2N4R-tau was ubiquitinated in the presence of Mg-ATP, E1, E2: UbcH5c, E3: axotrophin RING-variant domain and ubiquitin (lanes 2 and 3) or left unmodified by omission of UbcH5 in the reaction mix (lanes 4 and 5). Microtubule assembly in the presence of ubiquitinated 2N4R-tau or non-ubiquitinated 2N4R tau was performed and microtubules were pelleted. Lane 1 shows the absence of tau immunoreactivity in the microtubule pellet, when no exogenous tau is added. Tau species in supernatant (lanes 3 and 5) and microtubule pellet (lanes 2 and 4) were detected by anti-tau immunoblotting. Ubiquitinated tau, visible by shifted bands was detected mostly in the supernatant and not in the microtubule pellet. The axotrophin C4HC3-RING-variant domain occurring in E3 ubiquitin ligases suggests that axotrophin itself may act as E3 ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, we investigated the potential E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of axotrophin and its association with relevant E2 enzymes. Due to the inherent instability of axotrophin in living cells we expressed and purified recombinant axotrophin C-terminus (aa 548–704) comprising the RING-variant domain from E. coli inclusion bodies and recovered enzymatic activity by a slow protein refolding process. For reconstitution of the ubiquitin ligase cascade we had to determine which E2 enzyme is the appropriate interaction partner for axotrophin. We performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to test interaction with E2 enzymes known to interact with RING-variant domains of other MARCH proteins. Here we identified members of UbcH5-family, UbCH12 and UbcH13 as interaction partners (<Fig. 2>). Therefore, we used UbcH5c as E2 enzyme together with other components of ubiquitination cascade (Mg-ATP, E1 ligase and biotinylated-ubiquitin) and with recombinant axotrophin RING-variant domain to assay for E3 ligase activity. Auto-ubiquitination of axotrophin detected by extravidin-HRP was used as readout of ligase activity. We verified specificity of the reaction by omission of each component and mutation of the axotrophin RING-variant domain (<Fig. 3>A). The linkage of ubiquitin to wild-type axotrophin RING-variant domain does not occur if one component of the ubiquitination cascade is absent. Replacement of the two cysteines 552/555 of the CRIC motif of axotrophin with serine residues should hamper binding of one of the catalytically essential zinc ions and reduce ligase activity. Although the coordination of the second zinc is undisturbed the mutated RING-variant domain has a strongly diminished ligase activity (<Fig. 3>A, compare lane 1 and lane 6). These data reveal that axotrophin RING-variant domain acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase with the feature of auto-ubiquitination.Having established an in vitro assay of ligase activity we performed a more thorough screening for potential E2 enzymes cooperating with axotrophin. <Fig. 3>B shows that beside UbcH5b/c, UbcH6 and to a lesser extent UbcH13 are supporting axotrophin E3 ligase activity because we observed a linkage of ubiquitin to axotrophin. UbcH1 (E2-25k) showed only weak activity and all other tested E2 enzymes (UbcH2, 3, 7, 8, 10) were inactive. The observation that tau and axotrophin RING-variant domain interact led us ask, whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the axotrophin RING-variant domain can induce ubiquitination of tau. To answer this question we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination assay containing Mg-ATP, E1, E2 UbcH5c, ubiquitin, axotrophin RING-variant domain as E3 and human tau isoforms 2N4R, 0N4R, 2N3R as putative E3 ligase substrates. 2N4R is the longest human tau isoform including two N-terminal inserts and four microtubule binding domains (441aa). 0N4R contains four microtubule binding domains but the N-terminal inserts are absent (383aa). 2N3R includes two N-terminal inserts and three instead of four microtubule binding domains (410aa)."
PMC4311138_5,"We used these three human tau isoforms to ascertain if there are differences in exon-specific tau ubiquitination by axotrophin RING-variant domain When E2 enzyme UbcH5c is not added only the unmodified tau band is apparent: for 2N4R tau at 62 kDa, for 0N4R tau at 55 kDa and for 2N3R tau at 58 kDa (<Fig. 3>C, lanes 4, 5 and 6). The same occurs when E3 enzyme axotrophin is omitted (<Fig. 3>C, lane 7). With a complete ubiquitination cascade we see additional tau bands above the unmodified tau band, which are shifted each by about 7–8 kDa. For 2N4R and 0N4R tau up to four such shifted bands above the unmodified tau band are visible (<Fig. 3>C, lanes 1 and 2). The 2N3R isoform exhibits two shifted bands above the unmodified tau band (<Fig. 3>C, lane 3). These shifted tau bands and some higher molecular weight tau immunoreactivity are the result of tau ubiquitination by the axotrophin RING-variant domain. In a second ubiquitination assay we used methylated ubiquitin, deficient for ubiquitin chain elongation, and observed a similar banding pattern compared to unmethylated ubiquitin (Suppl. Fig. 2, compare lane 1 with lane 3 and lane 2 with lane 4). This result led us conclude, that the tau isoforms are preferentially mono-ubiquitinated at multiple sites by axotrophin affecting at least four lysine residues in four-repeat tau isoforms (0N4R, 2N4R) and two lysine residues in three-repeat 2N3R isoform. The additional ubiquitination sites of 0N4R and 2N4R tau in comparison to 2N3R tau allows us to assume, that these ubiquitination sites are localized in the second microtubule binding domain encoded by exon 10, which contains 5 lysine residues. The ubiquitin-linkage to tau protein is confirmed by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody (<Fig. 3>D). Furthermore, the addition of an E4 poly-ubiquitin ligase activity using Ubc13/Mms2 to the ubiquitination cascade leads to a depletion of the shifted tau bands and to appearance of high molecular tau species (<Fig. 3>D), strongly labeled by the anti-ubiquitin antibody, which preferentially binds to poly-ubiquitinated proteins.Control ubiquitination of biotinylated 2N4R tau by recombinant E3 ligase Hdm2 in the presence of the complete ubiquitination cascade including UbcH5c did not induce tau ubiquitination (data not shown).In attempt to find more potential axotrophin interaction partners or substrates, we used the LexA-axotrophin RING-variant domain fusion protein (pEG-axoCT) to screen an AD-related cDNA library and we identified the catalytical subunit of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2Ba, calcineurin) and kinesin light chain (KLC1) as positive clones in the yeast two-hybrid assay (<Fig. 2>). We purified both proteins after recombinant expression in E. coli. Unlike tau protein, no incorporation of ubiquitin occurred in these proteins in the presence of the complete ubiquitination cascade (<Fig. 3>C lanes 8, 9 and lanes 10, 11). The multiple mono-ubiquitination of tau by the RING-variant domain of axotrophin suggests that the microtubule binding affinity of tau is affected by tau ubiquitination. To verify this assumption we assembled microtubules in the presence of ubiquitinated or non-ubiquitinated 2N4R tau protein obtained by incubation of tau in the presence of E1, axotrophin RING-variant domain (E3) and with or without UbcH5c (E2). Afterwards, the assembly supernatant containing unbound tau and the pellet containing microtubule-bound tau were separately analyzed via Western Blot (<Fig. 3>E). Mono-ubiquitination of 2N4R tau by the axotrophin RING-variant domain leads to additional tau bands above the unmodified tau band at 62 kDa. Ubiquitinated tau protein is found almost exclusively microtubule-unbound in the supernatant (<Fig. 3>E, lane 3). Non-ubiquitinated tau obtained by ubiquitination mix devoid of UbcH5c preferentially accumulates in the microtubule pellet (<Fig. 3>D, lane 4). This result shows that ubiquitin-modification of tau by the axotrophin RING-variant domain leads to a decreased microtubule binding affinity of tau. Tau filaments, a defining feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, have been reported to be ubiquitinated <[35]>. To analyze a possible association of axotrophin with tau proteins we prepared an affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against a C-terminal axotrophin epitope ARTLQAHMEDLETSED conserved in mammals. The specificity of this polyclonal anti-AxoCT antibody was verified by Western blotting of axotrophin-transfected cell culture and no cross-reaction with hyperphosphorylated PHF-tau has been observed (<Fig. 4>B). Next, we analyzed axotrophin localization in temporal cortex and hippocampus of five controls and AD brains. Immunohistochemistry of human control brain tissue revealed a predominant nuclear staining of pyramidal cells of layer III and layer V in the temporal cortex (<Fig. 4>A CO and inset c) and other brain areas. In 30% of pyramidal cells axotrophin immunoreactivity extends into the apical dendrite. rhetorical Fig. 4 Axotrophin immunohistochemistry of human brain tissue. (A) Brain sections (area 22) were labeled with the affinity-purified anti-AxoCT antibody and visualized with DAB/Nickel. In control brain (CO, lower panel, scale bar: 100 μm) axotrophin is enriched in the nucleus of pyramidal cells in layer III and layer V and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells (inset c, scale bar: 10 μm). In AD brain (AD upper panel, Braak stage V) the preferential nuclear localization is lost and axotrophin immunoreactivity is associated with pathological tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites around neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (inset a). In addition hypertrophic astroglial cells are labeled in AD brain (inset b). (B) Specificity of affinity-purified anti-AxoCT antibody. Panel a: COS7 cell lysate transfected with pEGFP-axoFL (lane 1), pEGFP-axoC2 (lane 2) and pEGFP (lane 3). Western blot analysis with anti-AxoCT antibody labels a 100 kDa protein in lane 1 corresponding to the GFP-axotrophin (aa 1-704) fusion protein and a 45 kDa protein in lane 2 corresponding to the GFP-axotrophin (aa 542-704) fusion protein. Endogenous axotrophin was undetectable. Panel b: PHF-tau prepared from temporal cortex of AD brain by the sarcosyl procedure was probed with antibodies Tau5/HT7 (lane 1) and anti-AxoCT (lane 2). Three immunoreactive bands corresponding to A68 PHF-tau were strongly labeled by the tau antibodies. The anti-AxoCT antibody does not cross-react with PHF-tau (lane 2). (C) Quantification of axotrophin in cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions obtained by differential protein extraction from temporal cortex (Brodmann area 22). Equal amount of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and labeled with a monoclonal axotrophin antibody. Signal intensity of the 80 kDa protein band was quantified by densitometry and revealed a significant loss of cytoplasmic and nuclear axotrophin protein in AD cases (Student's t-test, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). (D) Co-localization of axotrophin and neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus of AD brain. Axotrophin was labeled by the polyclonal anti-AxoCT antibody followed by Cy3-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (panel b) and for the detection of tau aggregates monoclonal tau antibody AT8 (1:500) was used followed by Cy2-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody (panel a). Fluorescence labeling was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Axotrophin is colocalized with tau aggregates in hippocampal neurons (panel merge, scale bar: 20 μm). Tau filaments, a defining feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, have been reported to be ubiquitinated <[35]>.

This contrasts with human tau gene transgenic mice, where the nuclear compartment of stellate and purkinje cells remains more spared of axotrophin immunoreactivity, for quantification see <Fig. 5>B.

Tau knock-out mice reveal a stronger nuclear axotrophin staining than mice expressing the human tau isoforms (human tau gene-transgenic mice, scale bar: 30 μm). The insets show that increased axotrophin staining in tau knock-out mice is due to a stronger axotrophin accumulation in the nucleus (scale bar 6 μm). (B) Semi-quantitative densitometric analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear axotrophin immunoreactivity. There is a significant increase in nuclear axotrophin localization due to the absence of human tau expression in Mapt knock-out brains (Mann–Whitney U-test, p ≤ 0.05, n = 3).

This leads us to the assumption that axotrophin may be sequestered by tau in the cytosolic compartment and this interaction diminishes axotrophin levels. Tau protein is known to occur in the cytoplasmic and nuclear subcompartments and fulfills different functions in these locations <[57]> and detection of endogenous axotrophin in human and mouse brain tissue revealed also a dual cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (<Fig. 4>, <Fig. 5>). Having shown that tau protein is influencing the intracellular axotrophin location we asked, which subcellular targeting signals within the axotrophin amino acid sequence are present.Transient overexpression of EGFP-tagged full-length axotrophin in primary neurons and cell lines showed a dual distribution by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Suppl. Fig. 3 and <Fig. 6>A1). To study which axotrophin sequences contribute to the different subcellular localizations, we transiently expressed different EGFP-tagged axotrophin domains: N-terminal domains (axoN1 aa 1–625, axoN2 1–541, axoN3 1–344) and C-terminal domains (axoC1 aa 333–704, axoC2 542–704) in N2A mouse neuroblastoma cells (<Fig. 6>) and in COS-7 cells (data not shown). <Fig. 6>A1 depicts punctuate cytoplasmic and diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution of full-length axotrophin in N2A cells. Deletion of the C-terminal 78aa stretch (axoN1) leads to a pronounced nuclear localization (<Fig. 6>A2). The same localization is found in axoN2, where additionally the RING-variant domain was removed (<Fig. 6>A3). AxoN1 localizes to bright, irregularly shaped structures resembling nuclear speckles. AxoN1 fragment contains 861aa and is too large to be targeted to the nuclear compartment without active nuclear import. This provokes the questions, where the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in axoN1 and the nuclear export sequence (NES) in the deleted 78aa fragment are localized."
PMC4311138_7,"Using prediction algorithms for NLS no candidate sequence was found  NES prediction identified the sequence LNLEDFD right after the RING-variant domain, but this sequence is still included in axoN1. The skewed amino acid composition of the N-terminal region rich in serine and arginine resembles serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which also travel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This led us test whether axotrophin has RNA recognition motifs. RNAbindR <[36]>, <[37]> predicts two RNA-binding stretches within aa 76–109 and 387–476 in axotrophin. To verify the significance of the RNAbindR prediction, we expressed axotrophin aa 1–344 (axoN3). AxoN3 is targeted to punctuate nuclear structures too, arguing for a predominant role of the first RNA-binding motif (aa 76–109) for nuclear targeting (<Fig. 6>A4). In an opposite approach, we deleted aa 1–332 of axotrophin (axoC1) and found a diffuse preferential cytoplasmic localization (<Fig. 6>A5). This emphasizes the functional relevance of the first RNA-binding motif, of which loss is not compensated by the remaining RNA-binding motif. Expressing the C-terminus starting with the RING-variant domain (axoC2, aa 542–704) EGFP-fluorescence reveals a more reticulate cytoplasmic appearance and in addition can be found at the plasma membrane and cellular extensions (<Fig. 6>A6). <Fig. 6>A7 presents for comparison the cytoplasmic localization of EGFP protein which also gains access to the nucleus by diffusion due to its small molecular size. rhetorical Fig. 6 Subcellular localization of EGFP–axotrophin fusion proteins. N2A cells were transfected with constructs encoding different axotrophin domains and full length axotrophin as EGFP-fusion proteins. Confocal images of EGFP fluorescence (A1–A7), nuclear DAPI fluorescence (B1–B7) and merge EGFP- and DAPI-fluorescence (M1–M7) were obtained by laser scanning microscopy. Axotrophin expressed as full length protein has a cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (A1, B1). In the cytoplasm axotrophin resides in granular structures in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus. In addition picture A1 shows two cells (marked with asterisk) with more prominent nuclear localization. Upon deletion of aa 626–704 axotrophin exhibits a predominant nuclear localization in a nuclear speckle-like appearance (A2, B2). This nuclear speckle-like localization does change when further amino acids were removed from the C-terminal end such as deleting the RING-variant domain leading to a more heterochromatin associated localization (A3, B3), visible by the large overlap with DAPI stained nuclear foci. After deletion the complete C-terminal half yielding a 344aa construct comprising only the first of two putative DNA/RNA binding domains the nuclear axotrophin localization is confined to smaller nuclear subcompartments (A4, B4). In contrast deletion of aa 1–332, removing the first of two putative DNA/RNA binding domains (A5, B5) results in a predominant cytoplasmic localization without the granular appearance observed with full-length axotrophin (A1, B1). Further deletion of the second putative DNA/RNA binding domain resulting in a construct comprising the RING-variant domain and the C-terminus leads to a cytoplasmic localization of the EGFP-fusion protein with a reticular occurrence (A6, B6). For comparison the dual appearance of solely EGFP in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments is shown (A7, B7). Tau protein is known to occur in the cytoplasmic and nuclear subcompartments and fulfills different functions in these locations <[57]> and detection of endogenous axotrophin in human and mouse brain tissue revealed also a dual cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (<Fig. 4>, <Fig. 5>).

The same localization is found in axoN2, where additionally the RING-variant domain was removed (<Fig. 6>A3). AxoN1 localizes to bright, irregularly shaped structures resembling nuclear speckles. AxoN1 fragment contains 861aa and is too large to be targeted to the nuclear compartment without active nuclear import. This provokes the questions, where the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in axoN1 and the nuclear export sequence (NES) in the deleted 78aa fragment are localized. Using prediction algorithms for NLS no candidate sequence was found. NES prediction identified the sequence LNLEDFD right after the RING-variant domain, but this sequence is still included in axoN1. The skewed amino acid composition of the N-terminal region rich in serine and arginine resembles serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which also travel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This led us test whether axotrophin has RNA recognition motifs. RNAbindR <[36]>, <[37]> predicts two RNA-binding stretches within aa 76–109 and 387–476 in axotrophin. To verify the significance of the RNAbindR prediction, we expressed axotrophin aa 1–344 (axoN3). AxoN3 is targeted to punctuate nuclear structures too, arguing for a predominant role of the first RNA-binding motif (aa 76–109) for nuclear targeting (<Fig. 6>A4). In an opposite approach, we deleted aa 1–332 of axotrophin (axoC1) and found a diffuse preferential cytoplasmic localization (<Fig. 6>A5). This emphasizes the functional relevance of the first RNA-binding motif, of which loss is not compensated by the remaining RNA-binding motif. Expressing the C-terminus starting with the RING-variant domain (axoC2, aa 542–704) EGFP-fluorescence reveals a more reticulate cytoplasmic appearance and in addition can be found at the plasma membrane and cellular extensions (<Fig. 6>A6). <Fig. 6>A7 presents for comparison the cytoplasmic localization of EGFP protein which also gains access to the nucleus by diffusion due to its small molecular size. The aim of the present study was to find tau-interacting proteins, which can affect tau conformation or posttranslational modification.We have identified and characterized axotrophin, a protein that binds and preferentially mono-ubiquitinates tau protein. The tau interaction domain of axotrophin is localized to a C-terminal 131aa fragment containing the RING-variant domain.Loss of nuclear localization and accumulation of axotrophin in neurofibrillary tangle containing neurons of AD brains indicates a relevance of axotrophin-tau interaction in the pathogenesis of this disease.Axotrophin is an atypical member of the family of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins <[15]>, due to its lack of a transmembrane domain and the C-terminal localization of the RING-variant domain. Viral E3 ligases such as K3 and K5 harboring a RING-variant domain have been shown to be involved in immune evasion by downregulating MHC class I protein <[38]>.Ubiquitin ligase activity of axotrophin has been demonstrated by Nathan et al. <[14]> by the high level of auto-ubiquitination, causing rapid axotrophin degradation. Decreasing axotrophin auto-ubiquitination by overexpression of ubiquitin hydrolases USP7 and USP9x increased the axotrophin level <[14]>. Because of the low endogenous levels of axotrophin we decided to characterize the enzymatic activity by making use of recombinant axotrophin. We succeeded with recombinant expression and purification of the enzymatically active axotrophin fragment."
PMC4311138_8,"Testing different E2 enzymes for axotrophin interaction in a yeast two-hybrid assay we identified UbcH5c as a strong interactor, stimulating also highest axotrophin auto-ubiquitination Other E2 enzymes with weaker axotrophin interaction, including UbcH12 and UbcH13, UbcH6 and UbcH1 (Hip2, E2-25K), were less efficiently recruited by axotrophin in the ubiquitination assay resulting in low levels of auto-ubiquitination.Preference of RING-variant domain of viral ubiquitin ligase K3 for UbcH5 and UbcH13 was elucidated by Dodd et al. <[39]>, whereas two recent investigations described UbcH1 as also an important axotrophin activator <[14]>, <[40]>. Whereas most membrane-bound MARCH proteins are involved in membrane-receptor downregulation such as MHCI and MHCII <[41]>, the substrate of axotrophin/MARCH7 ligase activity remains elusive. Flierman et al. <[40]> suggest that MHCI may serve as a target of axotrophin. Recently, Gao et al. <[42]> found that axotrophin mRNA and gp190 subunit of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor are inversely correlated, implying that gp190 can be ubiquitinated by axotrophin. We showed that endogenous and overexpressed full length axotrophin resides mainly in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments, where it also can interact with non-membrane bound substrates. We report that the microtubule-associated tau protein is such a cytoplasmic protein, which binds to axotrophin and is a substrate of axotrophin E3 ligase activity. We present several lines of evidence for this interaction, (i) positive interaction in two different yeast two-hybrid systems, (ii) association found by co-immunoprecipitation, (iii) axotrophin association with tau protein aggregates in Alzheimer's disease, (iv) altered axotrophin expression/localization in tau knock-out mice and (v) tau mono-ubiquitination by axotrophin in vitro.Mono-ubiquitination of tau protein by axotrophin is unlikely to be a proteasome targeting signal but rather affects affinity of tau to microtubules. Roughly half of the 44 potentially ubiquitin accepting lysine residues of the 2N4R tau isoform are comprised within the four microtubule-binding repeats. More ubiquitin was incorporated into four-repeat tau than three-repeat tau, suggesting that at least one ubiquitin acceptor lysine resides in exon 10. Therefore we assume a tau-microtubule-affinity regulatory activity of axotrophin, which has a stronger effect on four-repeat than on three-repeat tau protein. We could show that addition of ubiquitin side-chains prevents tau from binding to pre-formed microtubules.The preferential ubiquitination of four-repeat tau by the Hsc70-interacting protein CHIP was also noted by Hatakeyama et al. <[43]>. In contrast to axotrophin, CHIP induces poly-ubiquitination of tau regulating tau degradation <[44]>, <[45]>. Poly-ubiquitination sites in PHF-tau from AD brain were identified as Lys254, Lys311 and Lys353 <[35]>, <[46]>, whereas sumoylation was confined to Lys340 <[47]>. Tau poly-ubiquitination is acknowledged to be a late process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and in an animal model of tau pathology <[48]>, <[49]>. Whereas multiple mono-ubiquitination of tau by axotrophin could be a physiological event regulating microtubule binding affinity of tau it may also provide the basis for ubiquitin chain elongation by so called E4-ligases.One morphological feature of axotrophin knock-out animals is reduced axogenesis resulting in the absence of the corpus callosum <[18]>. Tau protein is enriched in the axonal compartment, where it functions as a regulator of microtubule dynamics. During process outgrowth and remodeling a locally reduced microtubule stabilizing activity of tau is required. This can be accomplished by phosphorylation of the KXGS motifs in the repeat region of tau protein by MARK kinases <[2]>, <[50]> or possibly by axotrophin mediated tau ubiquitination. It is speculated that loss of axotrophin activity may be analogously to prevention of KXGS phosphorylation leading to microtubule superstability and blocking process formation.Beside tau protein, we identified the catalytic subunit of PP2B and KLC1 as interaction partners for axotrophin RING-variant domain by yeast two-hybrid assay. We did, however, not accomplish the ubiquitination of these proteins by recombinant axotrophin RING-variant domain. Also, tau ubiquitination by E3 ligase Hdm2 failed. This emphasizes the specificity of the ubiquitinating activity of axotrophin towards tau protein. KLC1 interaction with axotrophin in yeast two-hybrid assay was not only confined to the C-terminal portion containing the RING-variant domain (pEG-axoCT) but was also detectable to a lesser extent with the N-terminal axotrophin domain (pEG-axoNT, data not shown). This interaction may result in intracellular transport of axotrophin-containing protein complexes giving rise to the granular and reticular intracellular localization of axoFL and axoN2. In the light of the recent argument of Lazarov et al. <[51]> that KLC1 tends to exhibit nonspecific binding to other proteins, the significance of KLC1 interaction with axotrophin remains unclear. The strong interaction of axotrophin with both isoforms of PP2B catalytic subunit is intriguing. Axotrophin mRNA upregulation has been found to be associated with transplantation tolerance <[19]>. Since PP2B is a crucial signaling molecule in regulating adaptive immunity <[52]> a potential inhibitory effect of axotrophin on PP2B activity may present an immune tolerance regulatory mechanism in addition to LIF receptor downregulation.Localization of endogenous axotrophin in mouse and human brain shows the same dual cytoplasmic/nuclear localization like overexpressed EGFP-tagged full-length axotrophin in cell lines. We found that the N-terminal portion comprising aa 1–344 targets axotrophin solely to the nucleus. This nuclear localization may be determined by the first RNA-binding stretch aa 76–109. Although NetNES analysis <[53]> predicts a leucine-rich nuclear export signal within aa 611–617 (LNLEDFD) after the RING-variant domain our analysis shows that a nuclear export signal must be contained further C-terminal within aa 625–704. The lack of this nuclear export signal in the EGFP-fusion protein axoN1 (aa 1–625) leads to a nuclear speckle-like appearance. The localization of axotrophin to nuclear speckles, a site of the pre-mRNA processing and mRNA export <[54]> and sequence similarity of axotrophin to serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins argues for a function of axotrophin in RNA maturation and export. The identification of factors controlling the partition between cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of axotrophin and identification of its nuclear interaction partners remains the target of future work. In summary, we have shown that tau protein interacts with axotrophin and becomes ubiquitinated by the axotrophin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Mono-ubiquitination of tau occurs in the microtubule-binding region and impairs microtubule binding. The dual residency of axotrophin represents different functions in the cytosol and the nucleus. We present a novel tau modification occurring preferentially on four-repeat tau protein which may impact on the pathogenesis of tauopathies. Tau is the major microtubule-associated protein in neurons involved in microtubule stabilization in the axonal compartment. Changes in tau gene expression, alternative splicing and posttranslational modification regulate tau function and in tauopathies can result in tau mislocalization and dysfunction, causing tau aggregation and cell death. To uncover proteins involved in the development of tauopathies, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for tau-interacting proteins. We show that axotrophin/MARCH7, a RING-variant domain containing protein with similarity to E3 ubiquitin ligases interacts with tau. We defined the tau binding domain to amino acids 552–682 of axotrophin comprising the RING-variant domain. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization confirmed the specificity of the interaction."
PMC4311138_9,"Intracellular localization of axotrophin is determined by an N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal nuclear export signal  In AD brain nuclear localization is lost and axotrophin is rather associated with neurofibrillary tangles. We find here that tau becomes mono-ubiquitinated by recombinant tau-interacting RING-variant domain, which diminishes its microtubule-binding. In vitro ubiquitination of four-repeat tau results in incorporation of up to four ubiquitin molecules compared to two molecules in three-repeat tau. In summary, we present a novel tau modification occurring preferentially on 4-repeat tau protein which modifies microtubule-binding and may impact on the pathogenesis of tauopathies. We search for tau-interacting proteins using a cytotrap yeast two-hybrid assay. MARCH7 was identified as a tau-binding protein and confirmed by several methods. Recombinant MARCH7 Ring-variant domain uses Ubc5 for E3 self-ubiquitinating activity. MARCH7 Ring-variant domain mono-ubiquitinates tau protein at multiple sites including the microtubule-binding domain. Mono-ubiquitination of tau protein diminishes its microtubule-binding. ."
PMC6456907_0,"Neurodegenerative disorders of ageing (NDAs) such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis represent a major socio-economic challenge in view of their high prevalence yet poor treatment. They are often called proteinopathies owing to the presence of misfolded and aggregated proteins that lose their physiological roles and acquire neurotoxic properties. One reason underlying the accumulation and spread of oligomeric forms of neurotoxic proteins is insufficient clearance by the autophagic–lysosomal network. Several other clearance pathways are likewise compromised in NDAs: chaperone-mediated autophagy, the ubiquitin–proteasome system, extracellular clearance by proteases and extrusion into the circulation via the blood–brain barrier and glymphatic system. This article focuses on emerging mechanisms for enhancing neurotoxic protein clearance, a strategy that may curtail the onset and slow the progression of NDAs. The authors would like to thank San-Michel Rivet for help in the preparation of the Figures, Karen Duff, Ross Jeggo, Marie-Claude Potier and Clot Mannoury la Cour for helpful comments on the manuscript, as well as Muriel Galliot and her colleague in the IDRS Documention Department for provision of papers relevant to this article. This article is based upon a small, focused Congress which was supported by an unrestricted grant from “Advances in Neuroscience for Medical Innovation”, affiliated to the Institut de recherche Servier. Neurodegenerative disorders of ageing [G] (NDAs) include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related tauopathies. They are ultimately fatal, have no disease-modifying therapies and are associated with an increasing socioeconomic burden due to their rising incidence. These ‘proteinopathies [G]’ display complex and partly distinctive pathophysiological profiles, yet all share a cardinal feature: accumulation of aberrantly processed and misfolded proteins such as amyloid-β [G] (Aβ), tau [G], α-synuclein [G], TAR DNA-protein 43 [G] (TDP-43) and mutant forms of huntingtin (Htt) [In NDAs, these proteins lose their physiological roles, aggregate and acquire novel neurotoxic functions<1>, and an impairment of elimination is implicated in their buildup and spread<1>–<5>.As summarized in <Figure 1>, several endogenous mechanisms are involved in neurotoxic protein clearance. The glymphatic system [G] and the blood–brain barrier [G] (BBB) extrude neurotoxic proteins from the extracellular space, interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where they may also be degraded by proteases or phagocytosed by microglia and astrocytes. Within neurons and other cell types, intracellular elimination of neurotoxic proteins is predominantly effected by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) or by autophagy, a process by which superfluous or potentially dangerous cytoplasmic material is delivered to lysosomes [G] for degradation Three basic types of autophagy are recognised (<Figure 2>)<3>,<4>: microautophagy, in which cytosolic material is directly engulfed by invaginations of lysosomes; chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which involves translocation of non-membrane bound, chaperone-captured substrates across the lysosomal membrane, and macroautophagy, which involves sequestration of cytosolic material into de novo synthesized, double-membrane-bound autophagosomes that deliver their contents to lysosomes for digestion. The whole process, from the formation of the autophagosome isolation membrane to cargo digestion in the lysosome, is referred to as autophagic flux (<Box 1>). Macroautophagy is far better characterized than the other two types, so we use the term autophagy to refer to macroautophagy from this point on unless otherwise specified.In this article, we first summarize the key aspects of the autophagic–lysosomal network (ALN), CMA and the UPS, then outline the nature of their disruption in NDAs. We then consider opportunities and challenges for intervening via these systems with the goal of clearing neurotoxic proteins in NDAs Owing to its predilection for aggregated forms of neurotoxic proteins, as well as damaged organelles that also build up in NDAs, the ALN is an especially attractive target for disease modification and consequently a major focus of this article However, it is unlikely that modulation of the ALN will prove to be a panacea<1>,<4>,<5>, and opportunities for harnessing non-ALN driven mechanisms of clearance for course alteration of NDAs are discussed as well<2>,<3>. We also review mechanisms for the clearance of extracelluar neurotoxic proteins and strategies for their therapeutic enhancement Finally, we analyse over-arching issues for the characterization and development of therapies to promote neurotoxic protein clearance in NDAs Autophagy is a phylogenetically-conserved mechanism crucial for the intracellular clearance of burdensome proteins in all cell types, including neurons. Furthermore, astrocytes and several subtypes of microglia play important roles in the phagocytosis and subsequent autophagic elimination of extracellular pools of neurotoxic proteins<6>–<8> In addition to bulk clearance of cytoplasmic contents, dedicated autophagy receptors promote sequestration of specific misfolded and/or aggregated proteins, damaged organelles, aggresomes [G], stress granules [G], peroxisomes [G], endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi components, lipids, ribosomes, polysaccharides and nucleic acids<4>,<9>. LC3-II and adaptor/scaffold receptor proteins such as optineurin and p62 recruit discrete classes of protein to autophagosomes<10>. Other scaffolds include Nix, BNIP1 and prohibitin-2 for dysfunctional mitochondria (<Box 2>)<4>,<9>–<11>. Ubiquitin-dependent and non-ubiquitin-dependent autophagy occurs, with ubiquitination of tau and other neurotoxic proteins enhancing capture by autophagic receptors such as p62. Post-translational modifications such as acetylation (e.g., of Htt) may favour ALN degradation, but await further evaluation<12>.Autophagy can be constitutive or inducible, rapidly adapting to alterations in the internal and external environment of cells. Flexibility is important for maintaining normal brain function and for ensuring a constant supply of recycled amino acids, sugars, lipids and other products of ALN-mediated catabolism<3>,<13>. That autophagy serves an essential housekeeping role is demonstrated by genetic ablation of autophagy-related genes [G] (Atg). For example, mice with neuron-specific Atg7 or Atg5 deletions develop early post-natal neurodegeneration<14>, while knockdown of Beclin 1 (the mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg6 [exacerbates the vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to energy deprivation<15>. Moreover, post-mitotic neurons cannot dilute harmful proteins via mitosis, so they are uniquely vulnerable to impairment of clearance<1>,<3>,<5>,<16>–<18>.Maintaining efficient ALN flux (<Box 1>) requires coordination of a suite of modulatory proteins and phospholipids (<Figure 3>)<3>,<10> Changes in their amount, stoichiometry and function are characteristic of NDAs<1>–<3>,<5>,<10>,<18>–<20>. The heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase, AMP-regulated kinase [G] (AMPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin complex [G] (mTORC1) respectively trigger and repress autophagy and mitophagy (<Figure 3>, <Box 2>)<3>,<10>,<20>–<23>. Unc-51-like kinase (Ulk1) is primarily an autophagy-initiating protein<3>,<10>,<19>, as is mTORC1-suppressed transcription factor EB (TFEB), which orchestrates the synthesis of lysosomal and other proteins critical for maintaining ALN flux<20>–<23>. Since the class III deacetylase, sirtuin 1, requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [G] to sustain its activity, this positive regulator of autophagy may also be considered as a sensor<24>."
PMC6456907_1,"Intrinsic sensors detect changes in intracellular levels of glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, AMP, inositol triphosphate (IP3), cytosolic Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and metabolic intermediates such as acetyl coenzyme A [G] (<Box 2>)<5>,<13>,<19>,<21>,<23>,<25>  For example, decreased glucose availability and impaired mitochondrial respiration compromise ATP production, leading to elevated levels of AMP and ADP, which allosterically activate the γ-subunit of AMPK<21>. Extrinsic sensing occurs via drug-targetable mechanisms at the plasma membrane. First, receptor tyrosine kinases converge onto mTOR1, AMPK or the Beclin 1–Vps 34 complex (<Figure 3>) to modulate autophagy following stimulation by growth factors<10>,<26>. Second, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion-channel coupled receptors control autophagy via signalling pathways that likewise modulate AMPK and mTORC1<27>–<29>. GPCR-mediated generation of cAMP can negatively regulate autophagy via, for example, protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Atg proteins<27>,<29>,<30>. Third, specific classes of cytokine and cytokine receptor also modulate autophagy, although events in the brain remain poorly defined<23>.AMPK is central to several mechanisms that trigger autophagy — most importantly, phosphorylation-activation of Ulk1/2 (Ser317 and Ser777) and phosphorylation-inhibition of mTORC1<21>,<31> [Conversely, mTORC1 inhibits Ulk1/2 by Ser757 phosphorylation<3>,<4>,<31>. mTORC1 also restrains autophagy by preventing nuclear translocation of TFEB<20>. Other transcription factors that positively regulate autophagy include Forkhead-Box O1 and O3<22>. Conversely, repression is effected by STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and, possibly, ZKSCAN3, although its role has been disputed<22>,<32>. Sirtuin 1 is activated by AMPK-mediated increases in nicotinamide: it drives the ALN by inhibition of mTORC1, induction of Forkhead-O1/O3, and activation of key regulatory proteins such as Atg5, Atg7 and LC3. These actions comprise part of a broad palette of sirtuin-1-mediated neuroprotective effects in NDAs<24>. Activation of Ulk1 triggers autophagosome nucleation through phosphorylation-activation of Beclin 1 within the autophagy-specific Vps 34 kinase complex<10> (<Figure 3>). LC3 and other family members such as GABARAP covalently conjugate with phosphatidylethanolamine and assist in elongation of the isolation membrane and closure of autophagosomes<1>,<3>,<10>,<33>. They also serve as docking sites for autophagy receptors that selectively capture ALN substrates (<Box 1>)<3>.Compared to glia, the complex structure of neurons complicates ALN degradation of neurotoxic proteins<1>,<8>,<10>,<18>. Autophagosomes formed in synaptic terminals and neurites must be retrogradely transported with the aid of microtubules and dynein–dynactin motor complexes to the perikarya where lysosomal fusion occurs<10>,<16>,<34>. Indeed, many autophagosomes fuse with late endolysomal compartments containing membrane-localised Rab7 protein [G] (a GTPase) and lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP)1 before reaching the perikaryon. This implies that the ALN process is partly intiatiated in advance of fusion with mature lysosomes and full luminal acidification, a process completed upon arrival in the perikaryon (<Figure 2>)<10>,<16>,<34>,<35>.Autolysosome formation is facilitated by the retromer complex, itself retrogradely transported to cell bodies<36>,<37>. SNARE [G] proteins and the homotypic fusion and vacuole-protein sorting complex bridge mature autophagosomes/amphisomes to lysosomes to initiate fusion<4>,<19>. Rab proteins and LAMP1/2 collectively aid in autophagosome maturation and lysosomal fusion, which is also dependent on membrane constituents such as phospholipase D1 [G], phosphoinositols and other phospholipids such as cholesterol<10>,<19>,<38>. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes that provide the hydrolases required for cargo degradation<3>,<4>,<9>,<39>. Hydrolases are dependent on a low pH, and lysosomal acidification is promoted by vacuolar-type H+-ATPase complex (v-ATPase), which pumps protons into the lysosomal lumen. The electrogenic potential created by proton import is mediated by multiple ion channels that influence lysosomal pH<40>. Underpinning the importance of acidity, digestion can be halted by v-ATPase inhibitors such as bafilomycin A<41> and lysosmotropic basic amphiphiles such as chloroquine that alkalinize the lysosomal lumen<42>. Furthermore, a deficiency of lysosomal cathepsins (B, L and D etc) prevents protein degradation and leads to accumulation of undigested cargo<16>,<17>,<39>. Lysosomal dysfunction blocks flux across the entire ALN, as evidenced by lysosomal storage diseases [G] (LSDs) such as Niemann-Pick Type C [G] that manifest with neuropathological phenotypes (<Suppl Box 1>)<43>.In addition to ALN function, the importance of maintaining lysosomal activity reflects a broader role in, for example, regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ and energy homeostasis<44>. Like macroautophagy [CMA is important for amino-acid recycling during periods of poor nutrient availability but, in contrast, it involves transfer of protein substrates for degradation into the lysosomal lumen without enclosure by any membrane structure (<Figure 2>)<45>–<47>. With the help of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and other co-chaperones, heat shock cognate protein 70 [G] (Hsc70) recognises soluble, cytosolic proteins bearing a KFERQ [G] or equivalent motif and guides them to the transmembrane LAMP2A receptor<1>–<5>,<10>,<47>. The substrate complex binds to the cytosolic tail of LAMP2A, leading to LAMP2A stabilization and oligomerization: following unfolding of the protein cargo, it is then translocated into the lysosomal lumen. This process is aided by a specific, low pH-dependent lysosomal form of Hsc70 (Lysine-Hsc70), which promotes dissociation of the LAMP2A multimer so that the monomeric form is again available for substrate recognition and import. The level of LAMP2A determines the rate of CMA.In contrast to the ALN, CMA is not devoted to the degradation of higher-order neurotoxic proteins and aggregates, but it is important for clearing oxidized proteins. Tau, α-synuclein and TDP-43 are substrates for CMA degradation, as well as APP but not Aβ42 itself<3>,<45>–<47>,<48>. Htt is not efficiently cleared by CMA, and the same appears to hold for its fragments, mutant and post-translationaly modified forms, although the precise role of CMA in Htt elimination remains to be more fully defined<2>,<45>–<47>. The UPS mainly targets soluble and monomeric proteins rather than aggregates, using a process involving Hsp70 and the sequential actions of three classes of ubiquitin ligase (E1, E2, and E3). They effect the addition onto targeted proteins of ubiquitin residues, often as polyubiquitin chains, at single or multiple lysine sites (<Figure 2>)<2>,<3>,<8>,<48>,<49>. Ubiquitinated substrates are recognised by the 19S regulatory particle of the UPS complex. After binding to the Rpn subunits of the 19S ring, ubiquitin motifs are removed by three enzymes, Usp14, Uch37 and Rpn11. Rpn11 removes ubiquitination chains only after substrates are committed to destruction, whereas Ups14 and probably Uch37 act before commitment and hence can rescue substrates<49>. Following removal of ubiquitin moieties, proteins are unfolded by the Rpt1–6 subunits (ATPases) of the 19S component. The substrate then passes the α-subunit gate of the 20S core particle to enter its central β-subunit, which possesses peptidase activity (trypsin, chymotrypsin and caspase-like) and effects proteolysis.In addition to ubiquitinated substrates, the UPS can also handle oxidized proteins, which may accumulate under conditions of cellular stress<8>,<50>. Furthermore, as well as cytosolic proteins, the UPS degrades mitochondrial proteins that build up upon failure of mitochondrial import or sorting<51>. It also operates in the nucleus."
PMC6456907_2,"Interestingly, the UPS is important for elimination of tau and other neurotoxic proteins in post-synaptic dendritic compartments (a key site of spreading), where it plays a more general role favouring synaptic plasticity, dendritogenesis and memory formation<49>,<52>  Susceptibility of neurotoxic proteins to ubiquitination is modified by phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications<3>,<8>,<49>,<51>. Neurons adopt multiple strategies to deal with potentially dangerous proteins. With the aid of chaperones such as Hsp70, anomalously configured proteins may be refolded or, if clumped in aggregates, disassociated<2>,<3>,<53>. Neurotoxic proteins may also be sequestered in insoluble tangles (for example, as with tau) or in microtubule-associated aggresomes<2>,<4>. This intracellular lock-up may, at least initially, be neuroprotective, but continuing accumulation eventually poses a threat to cells, underscoring the importance of elimination<2>,<4>. While clearance systems are, at least initially, recruited in NDAs, they eventually become unable to cope with the additional neurotoxic burden (<Table 1>)<1>,<5>,<9>,<18>,<54>,<55>. The partly common and partly disease-specific patterns of ALN, CMA and UPS disruption in NDAs are superimposed upon a generalized, age-related decline in clearance both in neurons and in other cell types such as microglia<1>,<2>,<7>,<18>,<46>,<47>,<55>,<56>. Insufficient neuronal ALN flux is frequently manifested by lysosomal accumulation of lipofuscin [G] <18>.For optimisation of therapy in NDAs, accurate interpretation of the causes of impaired elimination of neurotoxic proteins is paramount. This is challenging since it may be a repercussion of upstream anomalies such as protein overproduction, misfolding or an excessive cytosolic unfolded protein response [G] (UPR) (<Suppl Box 2>)<57>. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify the exact nature of UPS, CMA and ALN dysfunction [G] (<Box 1>). While inadequate ALN flux is a common problem for all NDAs, under certain conditions ALN overactivity may contribute to pathology and even autosis [G] <4> in ALS (<Suppl Box 3>).The following paragraphs and <Table 1> summarize the complex patterns of defective neurotoxic protein clearance seen in specific classes of NDAs. While induced in the early phase of AD<1>,<3>,<47>,<58>, ALN, UPS and CMA-mediated clearance eventually becomes overwhelmed and impaired. First, autophagosomes and autophagic vacuoles indicative of failed maturation, transport and/or fusion with lysosomes are abundant, particularly in dystrophic neurites. Their accumulation may be linked to impaired lysosomal elimination of cargo<18>. Second, while decreases in Beclin 1 levels in AD remain to be confirmed, sirtuin 1 expression is diminished<24>. Third, apolipoprotein E4 [G] allele (ApoE4), a major risk allele for sporadic AD, is associated with increased generation and accumulation of Aβ42<59>,<60>. ApoE4 slows lysosomal Aβ42 clearance and, like Aβ42 itself, destabilizes lysosomal membranes. In addition to decreased degradation, one consequence is leakage of asparaginyl endopeptidase into the cytosol, where it generates toxic fragments of tau<61>. Moreover, ApoE4 impairs the elimination of Aβ42 and tau by astrocytes and microglia, additionally compromised by decreased activity of TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2)<7>,<62>. Fourth, genetic mutations and anomalies of presenilin 1 [G], a dominant-negative gene linked to AD, are associated with reduced lysosomal v-ATPase-mediated acidification<40>,<63>, a compromised ALN and deficient mitophagy<64>. Presenilin-2, likewise an autosomal-dominant risk gene, is enriched in late endosomes/lysosomes, where its dysfunction provokes lysosomal accumulation of insoluble Aβ42 and possibly tau<65>. Fifth, mutations in amyloid precursor protein [G] (APP), similarly disrupt endosomal and lysosomal function, in part due to accumulation of the β-secretase-generated, carboxyl-terminal and Aβ42-containing fragment of APP called C99<66>. Sixth, Aβ42 compromises the function of AMPK to impede initiation of the ALN<67>. Finally, Aβ42 obstructs the UPS and CMA<47>,<68>. Both aggregates and mutant forms of tau likewise block the proteasome, and its efficacy for degrading hyperphosphorylated and oligomeric tau is reduced compared to the physiological form<3>,<55>,<68>. Finally, while physiological tau possesses KFERQ motifs and is degraded by CMA, aggregates, mutant forms and fragments interfere with CMA<45>,<47>. Disrupted proteostasis is also a major feature of PD, with the efficiency of ALN, CMA, UPS and other modes of clearance compromised by multiple cellular anomalies. First, autosomal-recessive forms of early-onset PD are associated with mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase (PINK1) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin: [G] these mutations lead to deficits in the mitophagic removal of damaged mitochondria (<Box 2>)<69>,<70>. Second, the GTPase leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most commonly “mutated” protein in late-onset, familial PD. Its role is complex, with both loss and gain of function mutations. Some of these lead to an impairment of the ALN due to reduced activation of Beclin 1; another repercussion may be altered processing of APP, providing an unexpected link to AD<69>,<71>–<73>. Third, α-synuclein mutations, triplication or excess amplify the ALN burden, interfere with autophagosome formation and irreversibly disrupt the lysosomal membrane<1>,<3>,<44>,<56>. Fourth, homozygous mutations of lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase provoke the LSD, Gaucher’s disease [G], which is linked to decreased ALN flux, α-synuclein accumulation and a five-fold increase in risk for PD (<Suppl Box 1>)<43>. Decreased β-glucocerebrosidase activity also occurs in sporadic PD, leading to the build-up of glucosides, lipid dyshomeostasis, poor clearance of α-synuclein and impaired lysosomal activity<43>,<74>,<75>. Fifth, defects in several genes disrupt lysosomal acidification<40>. For example, disruption of the ATPase ATP13A2 (PARK9), which is also depleted in sporadic PD, leads to lysosomal alkalisation and digestive failure<76> together with accumulation of α-synuclein and other ubiquinated proteins<76>–<78>. Sixth, aggregates and mutant forms of α-synuclein disrupt the proteasome in dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, mutations in Parkin and several other genes are linked to reduced UPS activity<2>,<56>,<69>,<79>,<80>. Finally, oligomeric and mutant forms of α-synuclein impair LAMP2A-mediated cargo transport for CMA, while levels of both LAMP2A and Hsc70 are reduced in PD brain<45>,<47>,<55>,<80>. In addition, CMA is disrupted by several genetic mutations occurring in PD, including LRRK2 (<2>,<3>,<45>–<47>,<55>,<69>,<80>). CMA dysfunction in PD favours the accumulation of α-synuclein and leads to inactivation of the dopaminergic neuron survival factor, MEF2D (<2>,<45>,<47>,<55>). As FTD was initially associated with tau mutations, it was originally considered a “tauopathy”<81>,<82>. However, in light of common risk genes such as p62 (Sequestome1) and C9ORF72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72), FTD is increasingly linked to ALS<82>,<83>. Genetic anomalies in FTD are closely related to a deficient ALN, and, like ALS, the disease is characterised by aggregates containing tau, TDP43, Fused-in-Sarcoma and other ubiquitinated proteins insufficiently cleared by the ALN<82>,<84>. Aggregates interfere with the UPS to create a vicious circle that further overloads the ALN<1>,<18>,<55>,<56>,<68>,<84>. Recently, it was found that poly-glycine/alanine tracts linked to mutant forms of the C9ORF72 gene form twisted ribbon aggregates that sequester and stall the activity of proteasomes<85>. MAPT (tau) is a distinctive risk gene for FTD versus ALS, and dissociation of tau from microtubules disrupts retrograde transport of autophagosomes to the lysosome<81>,<82>."
PMC6456907_3,"In addition, lysosomal dysfunction and loss of acidification is caused by tau fragments and a deficit of progranulin<40>,<82>,<83>,<86>, while an interrelated deficiency of endosomal trafficking is linked to mutations in CHMP 2B (charged multivesicular body protein 2B) as well as C9ORF72<82>,<83>  ALS shares many causal genes with FTD, including p62, CHMP2B, TBK1 (tank-binding kinase 1), optineurin and others associated with deficits in ALN and mitophagy. For example, mutations in optineurin and TBK1 interfere with cargo loading<82>,<84>,<87>. Mutations in C9ORF72 (the most prevalent risk gene for familial ALS and FTD) are likewise linked to disruption of the ALN, including interference with dynactin–dynein coordinated transport of autophagosomes along axons of motor neurons to the perikarya<82>,<88>. They also lead to deregulation of Rab-GTPases and a failure of autophagosome elongation<89>. Paradoxically, however, certain anomalies of C9ORF72 may stimulate the ALN and, under conditions of severe cellular stress, high ALN activity may be detrimental (<Suppl Box 3>)<48>,<88>,<90>. In any event, depending on their genetic profiles, ALS patients reveal aggregates of risk gene-encoded proteins like TDP-43, optineurin, Fused in Sarcoma and/or superoxide dismutase (SOD1) [G] <48>,<82>,<84>,<87>,<89>. Aggregated SOD1 and TDP-43 disrupt CMA and the UPS — with the latter also impaired by mutations in the C9ORF72 gene<2>,<8>,<47>,<48>,<55>,<85>,<91>. Thus, mirroring other classes of NDA, a failure to clear neurotoxic proteins is characteristic of ALS<48>,<82>,<84>. In this autosomal-dominant, polyglutamine disorder, an increase in CAG-expansion repeats [G] in the HTT gene encoding Htt protein magnifies its propensity to oligomerise<2>,<3>,<55>,<80>. Mutant Htt is cleared by autophagy, but it compromises the ALN because of decreased poor cargo loading and impaired autophagosome formation and transport<55>,<56>,<68>,<92>. Furthermore, ALN disruption in the striatum (a region strongly affected in HD) involves altered activity of the striatal-specific Beclin 1 and Htt-interacting protein Rhes<93>,<94>. In addition, loss of physiological Htt and abnormal polyQ-Htt perturb neuronal cilia — important sites of cellular communication and signaling that reciprocally interact with autophagic mechanisms controlling their formation and growth<92>. CMA only poorly handles mutant and post-translationally modified forms of Htt, which interfere with its activity<2>,<45>,<47>,<95>. While LAMP2A and Hsc70 are upregulated in early HD to compensate for decreased ALN clearance, CMA eventually fails in parallel with neuronal loss<47>,<96>. The status of the UPS in HD is currently unclear, but it only poorly cleaves mutant forms of Htt (and other polyglutamine tracts), while animal models suggest that it is impaired in HD [which would further lead to reduced clearance of Htt<97>. Ultimately, any strategy that improves protein quality control and reduces excessive generation, aberrant processing and/or abnormal folding of neurotoxic proteins should moderate the ALN burden and facilitate clearance. For example, agents that promote folding of nascent proteins, prevent misfolding, refold aberrantly configured proteins, dissociate aggregates, counter ER stress and/or blunt an excessive UPR might pre-empt the build-up of neurotoxic proteins (<Suppl Box 2>)<1>,<2>,<54>,<56>,<57>,<84>,<98>–<100>. However, the present review focuses on strategies for elimination of neurotoxic proteins (<Table 2> and <Figure 4>). It should be noted that the precise mechanisms of drug action are not invariably well-defined<4> and that certain agents exert multiple beneficial (or deleterious) actions. For example, methylene blue counters tau oligomerization as well as promoting autophagy (<Suppl Table 1>)<101>,<102>. In addition, several agents such as resveratrol interact at multiple nodes of the ALN. Indeed, future drugs designed to act in a multi-modal manner may prove to be the most effective for enhancing neurotoxic protein clearance in NDAs.The following paragraphs mainly relate to classical small-molecules drugs: innovative treatment modalities for reinforcing clearance are outlined in <Box 3>. Ligands inhibiting GPCRs coupled to the AC–cAMP–PKA axis are potential activators of AMPK<27>,<29>. Indeed, clonidine and rilmenidine, two Gi/o coupled α2-adrenoceptor and imidazoline1 receptor agonists, stimulate autophagy and clear Htt in cellular<103> and animal models of HD<104>. Although their precise mechanisms of action await further elucidation<21>,<103>,<104>, there may be a role for calpains 1 and 2. These Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases are elevated in ageing and proteolytically generate various neurotoxic peptides<54>,<81>. They stimulate the AC–cAMP–PKA axis to inhibit AMPK by activation of GSα<103>. Genetic knockdown of calpain1 or 2 or overexpression of its endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, increased autophagy and cleared aggregates in SK-N-SH cells overexpressing a mutant form of Htt<103>. Efficacy was also seen in mutant Drosophila and mouse models of HD<54>. Calpeptin, a cell-permeable calpain inhibitor, can also reduce Htt proteinopathy via induction of autophagy<103>,<105>. Calpain inhibition by calpastatin or pharmacological agents also confers neuroprotective effects in other NDAs models, including enhanced clearance of tau, α-synuclein and SOD1<54>,<106>,<107>.The aminoimidazole derivative, AICAR, undergoes intracellular transformation to an AMP analog that triggers AMPK-mediated autophagy<21>,<108>. It conferred neuroprotection upon exposure of astrocytes to Aβ or oxidative stress<109> and countered α-synuclein toxicity in cultured rat neurons<110>. Another direct facilitator of AMPK, A769662, elicited autophagy and reduced the burden of Htt in a striatal cell line derived from knock-in mice expressing a humanized form of mutant Htt (exon 1 containing 7 polyglutamine repeats<111>). Selenium deficits have been linked to AD, so it is interesting that selenomethionine boosted ALN flux from AMPK recruitment through autophagosome formation to lysosomal degradation in the 3xTgAD mouse model<112>.The ‘anti-ageing’ agent resveratrol is thought to indirectly recruit AMPK via activation of calmodulin-kinase-kinase-β which, acting in synergy with Ca2, exerts its effects via Thr172 phosphorylation<113>. This action, amongst others (below), is involved in its reduction of Aβ levels in N2a cells and neurons<114> and the elimination of Aβ and Htt in animal models of AD and HD<114>,<115>.The anti-diabetic drug metformin, a prototypical activator of AMPK, induced autophagy and increased longevity in mice<116>. Like AICAR, metformin abrogated α-synuclein toxicity in primary cultures of cortical neurons, although the precise contribution of autophagy requires clarification<110>. Moreover, reductions in levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and Aβ were seen in metformin-treated neurons<117>,<118>, while it blunted neuronal loss in a neurochemical-lesion model of PD in mice<119>.The di-glucose derivative trehalose inhibits the SLC2A family of glucose transporters to promote AMPK-induced autophagy and reduce neurotoxic protein load, although it also exerts other actions downstream in the ALN<4>,<120>. Trehalose promoted autophagy and reduced disease progression in a SOD1 mouse model of ALS<120>. It also proved effective in cellular models of PD, HD and AD,<121>,<122> as well as in mouse models of HD, AD and tauopathies, where it cleared aggregates, reduced neurodegeneration and ameliorated motor and cognitive performance<123>–<125>.Lithium ions inhibit inositol monophosphatase to deplete inositol phosphate-3. This mechanism may be involved in its promotion of autophagy and reduction in cellular levels of α-synuclein, SOD1, Htt and tau<126>, amelioration of motor function in a P301L mouse model of tauopathy<127>, and slowing of disease progression in SOD1 mice<128>. However, its precise mechanism of action awaits further elucidation<126>."
PMC6456907_4,"Other compounds that act through AMPK activation include the anti-aggregant, methylene blue (<Suppl Box 1>), which elevated levels of Beclin 1, p62 and LC3, induced autophagy and suppressed tau in organotypic neuronal cultures and a mouse model of FTD<101>,<102>  In addition, calcitriol (the active metabolite of vitamin D3) elicited AMPK-dependent autophagy in a neurochemical lesion-induced model of PD<129>. One major strategy for promoting autophagy is relief of repression by mTORC1. This kinase is classically inactivated by rapamycin that binds to the modulatory protein FKBP12 (12-kDa FK506-binding protein). Enhancing autophagy with rapamycin reduced levels of α-syn, Fused-in-Sarcoma and Htt<130>–<132>. It also diminished polyglutamine aggregates and countered motor impairment in a Drosophila model of HD<133>. In addition, rapamycin abrogated pathology in murine models of AD and FTD, as well as countering neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice<134>–<136>. Likewise, temsirolimus reduced the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in SH-SY5Y cells and P301S tauopathy mice<137>. It also removed cellular aggregates of mutant Htt and improved motor performance in a mouse model of HD, reduced α-synuclein aggregation and afforded neuroprotection in a lesion-based model of PD, and depleted mutant ataxin 3 in a mouse model of supraspinal cerebellar ataxia 3<133>,<138>,<139>. Interestingly, several ‘small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin’ promoted autophagy and eliminated Htt in cellular and Drosophila models, but the precise role of mTORC1 in their actions remains to be clarified<140>.The natural product curcumin induced macroautophagy and neuroprotected rotenone-treated dopaminergic neurons<141> as well as accelerating elimination of mutant A53T-α-synuclein by repression of mTORC1 in a cellular model of early-onset PD, although it also exerts other actions such as modulation of protein acetylation and aggregation<142>,<143>. Pro-autophagic effects of curcumin are reflected in improved function, as well as reduced levels of α-synuclein aggregates<144> and Aβ/tau oligomers in cellular and animal models of PD and AD<145>,<146>.Inasmuch as phosphorylation by mTORC1 blocks translocation of TFEB from lysosomes to nuclei, mTORC1 inhibitors should promote the coordinated synthesis of proteins driving the ALN<20>,<22>,<147>. Indeed, TFEB over-expression reduced amyloid plaques in a APP/PS1 mouse model<148>. Moreover, the flavonol fisetin stimulated autophagic degradation of phosphorylated tau in cortical neurons via mTORC1-dependent activation of TFEB and the cytoprotective transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)<149>. Fisetin also reduced Aβ accumulation in an APP/PS1 mice model of AD<150>. Thus, mTORC1 — and, possibly, AMPK via poorly characterised cascades<21> — represent options for stimulating TFEB. It remains, nonetheless, a challenging target for induction<22>,<151>.C-ABL tyrosine kinase is a proto-oncogene that negatively regulates autophagy, partly acting upstream of the Akt–mTORC1 axis. It is over-activated in AD and tauopathies such as FTD<152>. Inactivation of c-ABL with brain-penetrant nilotinib conferred neuroprotective autophagy in mouse models of PD<153>. It also reduced aggregates in cell and mouse models expressing TDP-43 protein<154>. Nilotinib recently underwent a Phase I safety study for treatment of PD<155>. Activity of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 declines with age, partially due to limited availability of its co-factor, nicotinamide<24>,<56>,<156>. Therefore, it is interesting that nicotinamide and its analogues promoted autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria in fibroblasts<157> and reduced Aβ toxicity in rat cortical neurons<158>. They also improved mitochondrial energy generation and, partly as a consequence, reduced plaques in Aβ-expressing neuronal cells and AD mice, while improving cognitive function<58>. Nicotinamide analogues similarly slowed cognitive decline and neuropathology in a 3xTgAD mouse model of AD<159>.Resveratrol can stimulate sirtuin 1 via AMPK (see above), and it also possesses an AMPK-independent mode of sirtuin 1 recruitment that participates in blunting of the neurotoxicity of Aβ25–35 fragments in PC12 cells<160>. This possibly involves a role for the DNA-repair protein, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1). Its pharmacological inhibition elevates levels of the substrate, nicotinamide, with an enhancement of mitochondrial energy generation contributing to neuroprotective properties in an animal model of AD<160>,<161>.Cilostazol (a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor) clears Aβ42 from neuronal cell lines by promoting autophagy, upregulating Beclin 1, Atg5 and LC3, down-regulating mTORC1, and inducing lysosomal cathepsin B: these actions of cilostazol involve activation of sirtuin 1 as well as upstream Tyr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK<108>,<162>,<163>. Cilostazol improved cognition and reduced levels of A42 and hyperphosphorylated tau following intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ(25–35) into mice<162>,<163>.Protein deacetylation, as effected by inducers of sirtuin 1, is of broader relevance to the ALN, as reflected in activation of Atg gene transcription<20>,<24>,<164>. Furthermore, acetyl transferases such as p300 are druggable<20>,<165> and their inhibition (by garnicol) protected against autophagic deficits in a rodent model of PD<166>. Another p300 inhibitor, spermidine, has attracted attention by virtue of its autophagy-related increase in longevity<164>,<167>. Spermidine inhibited the acetylation of Atg proteins 7, 11 and 15 as well as that of histone 3, while inducing Beclin 1 via blockade of its cleavage through caspase 3<168>. Spermidine also decreased disease progression in a mouse model of FTD<169> and reduced α-synuclein toxicity in C. elegans<170>. Depletion of acetyl coenzyme A would be worth exploring in models of NDAs<171>. Underpinning interest in inhibitors of acetyl transferase, p300 expression is increased in AD brain and involved in the aberrant acetylation of tau<165>,<167>,<172>,<173>. As outlined in <Box 3>, the cell-permeable peptide, Tat-Beclin 1 [G], acts at the Beclin 1–Vsp 34 complex to increase autophagy and promote the clearance of Htt aggregates in cell lines<174>. In addition, the plant-derived alkaloid isorhynchophylline upregulated Beclin 1 independently of mTORC1 and promoted autophagic clearance of α-synuclein, although its precise mechanism of action remains to be clarified<175>. Beclin 1 bears a BH3 element on its N-terminus that is subject to inhibition by the anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2<19>,<165>,<176>. Disruption of this BCL-2–Beclin 1 complex is an alternative approach for promoting autophagy, as achieved in mouse fibroblasts by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737<177>. A knockin, gain-of-function Beclin 1 mutant with reduced repression by BCL-2 also increased autophagy, promoted Aβ sequestration and improved cognition in a 5XFAD mouse model of AD: this pattern of effects was reproduced with ML246, a novel autophagy potentiator with an uncertain mode of action<178>. Other potential approaches to Beclin 1 activation include inhibitors of (tau-phosphorylating) cyclin-dependent kinase 5<179>.The multi-modal agent resveratrol induced the expression of Atg4 and promoted autophagosome formation. This led to accelerated degradation of polyQ-Htt aggregates and protected SH-SY5Y cells from toxicity<180>. An unusual approach to augmenting autophagosome formation is represented by brain-penetrant ‘autophagy enhancer-99’ (AUTEN-99), which blocks Jumpy, a phosphatase that inhibits the phosphotidyl-inositol-3-kinase-mediated generation of the autophagosome membrane (<Figure 3>). Auten-99 augmented autophagic flux in isolated neurons, increased markers of autophagy in mouse brain and slowed neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of PD and HD<181>. Disruption of cytoskeletal networks and loss of microtubule function in NDAs compromises the transport of autophagosomes, late endosomes, amphisomes and retromers to perikaryal lysosomes, and hence impedes degradation of neurotoxic proteins<34>–<36>."
PMC6456907_5,"Accumulation of autophagosomes and lysosomes in axonal swellings is associated with local APP processing into Aβ42, as well as plaque formation<16>,<34>  The microtubule stabilizers paclitaxel and epothilone A countered Aβ42-induced cytoskeletal disruption — and moderated excessive UPR — in neurons<182>. Furthermore, epothilone D countered microtubule disruption and cognitive deficits in aged P301S/P19 AD mice<183>. However, it is unclear to what extent these agents promote ALN in the perikaryon, and a risk of cytoskeletal over-rigidity should not be neglected. Thus, mechanisms that promote microtubule/actin dynamics and cytoskeletal shuttling of autophagosomes/endosomes to lysosomes present alternative strategies for evaluation<184>.Several other, potentially targetable mechanisms might also aid autophagosome delivery to (and fusion with) lysosomes<185>. These include Rab and Rab-effector proteins which facilitate the assembly of Synataxin17–SNARE complexes critical for fusion<186>. Interestingly, genetic or pharmacological activation of Rab5 countered neurodegeneration in mouse C9orf72 models of ALS and FTD<187>. There is also growing interest in the stabilization of retromers for promoting fusion. This appears feasible based on modulation of their role in diverting APP out of endosomes and hence curtailing its cleavage into Aβ42<37>,<188>. Finally, inducers of histone deacetylase 6, broadly implicated in cytosolic transport and the fusion of autophagosomes, might be an option<3>. Maintaining optimal intraluminal acidity is critical for activating lysosomal hydrolases and digesting cargo. There are several ways that a loss of lysosomal acidity in NDAs might be countered. First, lysosomal acidification could be favoured by stabilised cAMP analogues: in human fibroblasts bearing a presenilin 1 mutation, cAMP acidified lysosomes and augmented the availability of cathepsins<189>. Second, the TFEB inducer 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin promoted the acidity of lysosomes in neurons<190>. Third, acidic nanoparticles such as polylactic acid and poly(lactide)co-glycolide increase acidification (<Box 3>). Fourth, activation of the lysosomal Ca2+ channel transient receptor potential mucolipin-1 with a synthetic agonist (ML-SA1) increased intralysosomal Ca2+ and lowered pH<191>,<192>. Other approaches include the enhancement of v-ATPase activity, and countering deficiencies in progranulin activity<40>,<63>,<86>,<193>–<195>.Dysfunction of PARK9 (ATP13a2) leads to an imbalance in the handling of zinc, a disruption of lysosomal activity and accumulation of α-synuclein<77>. Clioquinol, which acts as a metal chelator, reverses these deficits and may reinforce lysosomal function (and acidification) in NDAs where the regulation of zinc and other metals is abnormal<77>,<196>. Indeed, clioquinol countered disruption of autophagy by chloroquine in retinal cells, reduced Aβ42 accumulation in CHO cells expressing APP and mutant presenilin 1, and diminished amyloid-misfolding and aggregation in Tg2576 AD mice<196>,<197>. Cystatin B and C are endogenous antagonists of the cysteine-active site on lysosomal cathepsins and their genetic down-regulation ameliorated deficits in lysosomal proteolysis, synaptic plasticity and amyloid clearance in TgCNRD8 AD mice<198>. Pharmacological blockers of cystatins are currently being sought. In addition, upregulation of retromer complex might stimulate provision of hydrolases to the lysosome<37>,<188>.Lysosomal enzyme replacement is an established treatment for several primary LSDs: for example, β-glucocerebrosidase supplementation for type I (non-neuropathic) Gaucher’s disease (<Suppl Box 1>)<43>. Due to BBB impermeability, enzyme supplementation does not appear promising in PD. However, inhibition of substrate (glucosylceramide) synthesis by brain-penetrant GZ/667161 and GZ/SAR402671 reversed synucleinopathy in A53T-SNCA mice<199>. Another glycosphingolipid synthesis blocker, miglustat,<43> showed activity in cellular and in vivo models of PD<75>, although its ability to downregulate target sphingolipids in the brain is limited.One might also act upstream to promote lysosomal function by accelerating the import of functional enzymes. β-glucocerebrosidase again provides a good example. Ambroxol acts as a molecular chaperone to promote folding of β-glucocerebrosidase and aid its transit from the ER to lysosomes<43>. It increased expression of β-glucocerebrosidase, normalised autophagy and accelerated degradation of α-synuclein in a stem-cell model of dopaminergic neurons derived from PD patients bearing mutations for β-glucocerebrosidase<200>. Ambroxol, which also decreased ER stress in Drosophila<201>, reduced α-synuclein levels in overexpressing, transgenic mice<202>. It is being evaluated for use in idiopathic PD (<Suppl Table 1>). A downside of ambroxol is that it occludes the catalytic site of β-glucocerebrosidase, but novel agents like NCGC607 avoid this untoward effect<203>. Intriguingly, while enhancement of β-glucocerebrosidase conferred therapeutic benefit in animal models of PD, its inhibition by conduritol-β-epoxide was beneficial in a mouse model ALS, underpinning the apparently distinctive nature of ALS as regards ALN function and energy balance (<Suppl Box 3>)<90>.Finally, a more global approach for harnessing lysosomal activity would be the induction of TFEB<20>,<22>. Harnessing TFEB by 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin promoted clearance of proteolipid aggregates and α-synuclein in a cellular model of PD<195>,<204>. It also augmented the elimination of Aβ in a Tg19959/CRND8 mouse model of AD<173>. The protein kinase C activator HEP14 stimulated nuclear translocation of TFEB to boost lysosomal gene transcription and reduced Aβ plaques in APP/PS1 AD mouse brains<151>. Modulation of DNA methylation and post-translational histone marking offer further opportunities for transcriptional control of lysosomal activity, while miRNAs could intervene at the level of translation (<Box 3>)<20>,<165>. Some of the above-discussed agents have been clinically evaluated, alone or in association, in NDAs (<Suppl Table 1>). For example, metformin for cognitive function and energetic status in AD; resveratrol for functional decline and Aβ load in AD; rilmenidine for motor performance in HD; and ambroxol for β-glucocerebrosidase activity and motor function in PD. To date, despite some positive observations, unequivocal proof for symptomatic improvement and/or course-altering effects has not been provided for any drug (<Suppl Table 1>). Nonetheless, long-term effects remain under study, no medication that specifically and exclusively induces the ALN has as yet been therapeutically characterized, and proof of target engagement in clinical trials remains challenging. Hence, it is premature to draw conclusions as regards therapeutic efficacy.In fact, the anti-oxidant edavarone, which decreased autophagy in ischaemic brain and macrophages<205>, was recently authorized for use in a subset of ALS patients (<Suppl Box 3>)<206>. This appears paradoxical, but fits with the suggestion that high ALN flux is detrimental under conditions of severe cellular stress in ALS<90>. Whether decreased ALN flux is genuinely implicated in its clinical actions remains to be confirmed(<Suppl Box 3>)<3>,<206>. Anti-ageing and lifespan-extending benefits of ‘caloric restriction mimetics’ expressed across a range of multicellular organisms are related, at least in part, to the induction of AMPK and sirtuin 1, leading to promotion of autophagy<21>,<24>,<164>,<207>. These mimetics are generally safe yet encompass drugs that reduce ATP availability by interfering with cerebral/neuronal glucose uptake. This may pose problems because compromised neuronal energy is itself a risk factor for NDAs like AD and PD<25>,<164>. Nonetheless, efforts to find well-tolerated, autophagy-inducing mimetics are continuing<164> and clinical trials should prove instructive<25>,<164>."
PMC6456907_6,"Furthermore, there is increasing interest in pharmacological exercise mimics that exert putative neuroprotective properties via the modulation of AMPK, mTORC1, beclin 1 and other regulators of the ALN<21>,<207>  Opportunities for pharmacological manipulation of the UPS and CMA in NDAs are less well-established than those for the ALN, but there are encouraging routes of progress<2>,<45>–<47>,<55>,<56>,<68>. Furthermore, the UPS inhibitors bortezmib, carfilzomib and ixazomib are approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, indicating that clinical application of UPS modulators is possible<3>. One approach for reinforcing the UPS focuses on agents that target chaperones involved in the handling and recognition of neurotoxic proteins<2>,<68>,<208>. Of particular interest is Hsp70 which interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP to aid ubiquitination of proteins destined for proteasomal destruction<208>. Hsp70 binds to heat shock factor 1 [G] (HSF1) and, under conditions of neurotoxic protein stress, their dissociation leads to mutual activation, with HSF1 driving transcriptional generation of Hsp70 and other chaperones that facilitate proteostasis<208>,<209>. Hsp70 also exerts a more general role in the refolding and disassociation of aggregated proteins<2>,<3>.One promising agent is the hydroxylamine derivative arimoclomol, which increases the activity of Hsp70 by augmenting transcriptional activity of HSF1<210>. Arimoclomol rescued cultured motoneurons from oxidative stress and from the pro-apoptotic actions of staurosporine<211>. It also mediated the removal of mutant SOD1 aggregates and improved motor function in a mouse model of ALS<212>. Supporting interest in arimocomol, it mimicked recombinant Hsp70 in reversing lysosomal pathology in fibroblasts from patients with LSDs (<Suppl Box 3>). In an alternative approach, the rhodocyanine derivative YM-1 allosterically promoted the activity of Hsp70 to enhance degradation of polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins: these findings suggest potential utility in HD<213>. Furthermore, Hsp70 has been co-administered with inhibitors (IU1 and its more potent derivative, IU1–47) of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 to enhance proteasomal degradation of tau<214>–<216>. USP14 inhibitors act by preventing deubiquitination rescue of tau and other UPS substrates such as TDP43 and Ataxin-3. They may also effect allosteric changes in proteasomal subunits<217>. Interestingly, USP14 inhibitors promote the ubiquitination activation of Beclin 1 to recruit the ALN<216>Hsp90 counters the effects of Hsp70 by forming a complex with it to impede substrate ubiquitination: it likewise exerts a suppressive influence on HSF1<210>,<218>. Amongst compounds that inhibit Hsp90, geldanamycin promoted elimination of both hyperphosphorylated tau and oligomeric α-synuclein in cell lines<219>,<220>. Moreover, geldanamycin reduced Lewy-like bodies<221> and Htt aggregates in Drosophila neurites<222> and reduced tau in AD mice<219>. The less cytotoxic analogue of geldanamycin, 17-AAG, has improved brain penetrance. It decreased Aβ levels,<223> improved memory<224> and lowered tau in transgenic AD mice<224>. 17-AAG also reduced α- synuclein oligomers in H4 cells<220>. Another Hsp90 inhibitor, HSP990, has shown promise in lowering Htt aggregates and improving motor performance in two mouse models of HD<225> Numerous classes of kinase phosphorylate the proteasome<68>,<226>,<227>. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors protect cAMP from degradation to recruit protein kinase A and boost UPS activity. Accordingly, rolipram protected rat cortical neurons from Aβ-induced synaptic disruption<228>. Furthermore, in a transgenic tau mouse model of FTD in which 26S proteasomal activity was impaired, rolipram attenuated markers of tauopathy, improved memory and protected synaptic integrity by strengthening protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the Rpn6 component of the 26S proteasomal subunit<229>,<230>. Rpn6 activation may also be involved in the anti-ageing effects of caloric restriction<56>,<164>. Interestingly, resveratrol inhibits phosphodiesterase 4, suggesting that proteasomal recruitment may be yet another component of its global impact on neurotoxic protein clearance<113>. One concern with phosphodiesterase inhibitors/protein kinase A inducers is their huge range of targets (including AMPK), but it may be possible to target proteasome-specific isoforms. Furthermore, acting upstream of cAMP is an alternative strategy. Chronic administration of CGS21680, a selective agonist of AC-coupled adenosine 2A receptors, restored proteasomal activity in cellular and murine models for HD via protein kinase A-mediated Ser-120 phosphorylation of the Rtp6 component of the 19S subunit<231>.Another kinase that activates the proteasome (Rpt6 subunit) — and directs it to dendritic spines — is calmodulin-dependent kinase II<227>. Its recruitment may account for proteasomal activation by the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline<52>,<232>. Protein kinase G similarly activates the proteasome, and inhibition of cGMP breakdown by sildenafil reduced neurotoxic protein aggregation in cardiomyocytes, encouraging studies in NDAs<68>,<226>,<227>. P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase indirectly influences the phosphorylation status of the proteasome, probably via cAMP signalling<3>,<68>,<226>,<227>. P38 depletion, or its blockade by PD169316, accelerated the degradation of ubiquinated proteins, promoted α-synuclein clearance and improved cell survival<233>.Phosphorylation is a dynamic process, and small-molecule inhibitors of the nuclear proteasome phosphatase UBLCP1 suggest that calcineurin and other phosphatases represent hitherto-unexploited targets for enhancing UPS-driven clearance of neurotoxic proteins<227>. An important question is whether the UPS can specifically clear neurotoxic proteins while safeguarding those that function normally. Several strategies are under exploration. The first is targeted protein degradation with small molecules, which can be achieved by various compounds — including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACS) and phthalimides that bind to E3 ubiquitin ligases and the protein of interest, thereby promoting UPS-driven degradation<234>,<235>,<236> (These strategies are conceptually analogous, as described in this review http://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2016.211) (<Box 3>). Certain agents amplify PROTAC-mediated breakdown of α-synuclein<233>, while other classes of bifunctional ligand bind a target protein plus Hsp70 to direct UPS degradation<235>. Alternatively, target proteins can be bound by agents bearing bulky, hydrophobic adamantyl tags that provoke conformational instability and encourage proteasomal elimination<234>. Second, the cytosolic antibody receptor tripartite motif protein 21 binds to protein-coupled antibodies, then recruits the UPS for substrate degradation. This has been demonstrated for tau and could be adapted for degradation of other classes of neurotoxic protein<237>. Third, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein specifically binds mutant SOD1 and drives it to proteasomal degradation. This provides another potential path to discrete elimination of unwanted proteins in NDAs<238>. The transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2 are both substrates of proteasomal degradation, as well as inducers of proteasomal synthesis, and the latter has been specifically linked to NDAs<239>,<240>. Furthermore, Nrf2 is a master regulator of the anti-oxidant response and drives synthesis of lysosomal and anti-inflammatory proteins in addition to 26S proteasome components<149>. Translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus is promoted by triterpenoid derivatives that counter the ageing-related diminution of UPS activity<241>. In addition, sulforaphane elevates proteasome levels in vivo by inducing Nrf2, protects neurons against oxidative stress, and has been proposed for the treatment of HD<242>. Several other agents promote the proteolytic competence of proteasomes and facilitate clearance of Aβ and/or tau in cellular models, including betulinic acid. Enhanced transcription has been implicated in their actions, but this remains to be clarified<242>."
PMC6456907_7,"Finally, mirroring its inhibitory influence on the ALN, mTORC1 suppresses the UPS by impeding the formation and assembly of proteasomal subunits  Correspondingly, pharmacological blockade of mTOR may promote UPS degradation as well as ALN elimination of neurotoxic proteins<243>. Some mechanisms outlined above for the UPS, such as increasing chaperone-driven delivery of client proteins to degradative machinery, are also relevant to the CMA<47>,<48>,<95>. In fact, specific induction of CMA has received little attention, possibly since the rate-limiting element LAMP2A has, to date, proven intractable for small-molecule chemistry. Nonetheless, over-expression of LAMP2A accelerated CMA clearance of α-synuclein and afforded protection of dopaminergic neurons<45>, and several routes to potential pharmacological exploitation may be mentioned. First, cathepsin A cleaves LAMP2A, resulting in its lysosomal degradation, so selective inhibitors of cathepsin A should reinforce CMA<39>,<47>,<48>. Second, LAMP2A is stored in cholesterol-rich membrane regions: hence, cholesterol depletion might enhance transfer to regions where it is functionally active<46>. Third, the dynamics of the LAMPA2A-client protein translocation complex are (oppositely) controlled by mTORC2 and the phosphatase PHLPP1, offering potential targets for augmenting CMA<244>. Fourth, CMA is under the negative control of retinoic acid receptor-α and their blockade by synthetic, all-trans retinoic acid derivatives resulted in upregulation of CMA, including the activity of LAMP2A<245>. Mouse fibroblasts treated with these agents showed improved resistance to combined over-expression of α-synuclein and oxidative stress<245>. There are, then, emerging opportunities for intensifying the elimination of neurotoxic proteins by the UPS and CMA<47>,<68>,<227>. However, it is important that they are homeostatically regulated since — mirroring the ALN — excess activity is potentially dangerous<241>. As the UPS and CMA are disrupted by neurotoxic proteins like Aβ42 and tau, their early and preventative reinforcement may be critical. UPS potentiation might be particularly efficacious when enacted in dendritic sites of neurotoxic protein spreading to counteract NDA-related deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning<1>,<3>,<5>,<8>,<47>,<52>,<68>,<227>. As pointed out above, there is evidence of coordinated regulation of the ALN and UPS via mTORC1<1>,<3>,<5>,<243>. Furthermore, studies of a mutant tau allele that increases the risk for FTD and AD showed that upregulating the ALN compensated for the impairment of proteosomal activity<246>. This finding underscores the reciprocal interplay between these clearance systems<3>. Indeed, the ALN can ‘sense’ UPS failure and compensates by upregulating its own activity. For example, proteasomal failure exacerbates ER stress and leads via the UPR to the expression of sestrin 2, which recruits AMPK to down-regulate mTORC1 upstream of the ALN; Nrf2 is also upregulated<3>. Supporting the relevance of sestrin 2, it protects dopaminergic neurons from the neurotoxin, rotenone, via AMPK-transduced autophagy<247>. Sestrin 2 overexpression also prompted mTORC1-dependent autophagy in cortical neurons in a presenilin-knockout model of AD<248>. Proteasomal degradation of Ulk1, LC3 and other ALN regulatory proteins may prevent ALN over-activity, an observation of particular relevance to ALS (<Suppl Box 3>)<3>. By analogy, subunits of the catalytic core of the proteasome are regulated by CMA-mediated degradation<47>,<55>. When intracellular pathways of protection against neurotoxic proteins prove insufficient, neurons may alleviate the burden of harmful proteins by discharging them into the extracellular space. This may be a self-preservation mechanism and an attempt to acquire glial support for elimination. However, the ‘release’ of neurotoxic proteins contributes to trans-cerebral spread of pathology. That is, abnormal conformers of proteins originating in donor cells enter recipient cells to promote protein misfolding and disrupt clearance, diffusing in a domino, snowball-like fashion across the brain<81>,<249>.Exosomes [G] are involved in the release of tau, APP/Aβ−42 and α-synuclein. Accordingly, they are linked to the progression of NDAs <55>,<77>,<81>,<250>,<251>. Intriguingly, when the ALN is overwhelmed and cargo accumulates, a process of ‘autophagic’ exocytosis participates in the neuronal liberation of neurotoxic proteins. This discharge of neurotoxic proteins adds to the extracellular burden from dying cells, accelerates spreading, and underpins the imortance of clearance mechanisms extrinsic to neurons<250>,<252>. In this light, capture and digestion of extracellular proteins by glial cells is primordial<7>,<8>. However, there exist several other, therapeutically pertinent mechanisms for ridding the brain of extracellular pools of neurotoxic proteins. Neurons and glia contain diverse classes of protease, and they are localized in all those compartments where neurotoxic proteins accumulate — cytosol, mitochondria and even the nucleus<39>,<253>–<256>. However, certain intracellular proteases in the cytosol generate toxic fragments, notably of tau (calpains and caspases) and Htt (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)<39>,<257>. Accordingly, their inhibition rather than induction is of interest for the treatment of disorders such as AD and Huntington’s disease. Indeed, the inducible (extracellular) proteases most relevant to promoting neurotoxic protein clearance in NDAs are actively secreted by neurons and glia, located on exosomes and/or expressed on plasma membranes (<Figure 1>)<254>. They include several classes of MMP, neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and plasmin<253>,<256>,<258>,<259>.Aβ42 and amylin (a pancreas-derived, AD-associated protein found in brain) are substrates for degradation by IDE, which also irreversibly ‘traps’ Aβ42 and α−synuclein, preventing their aggregation and promoting ALN and UPS elimination<259>. Cerebral levels of IDE are reduced in early AD and in mouse models of AD while, mirroring AD amyloidosis, Aβ42 accumulates in mice genetically depleted of IDE. In a vicious circle, Aβ42 itself decreases IDE expression, although it may prompt its release from glia<254>,<259>. IDE also degrades and prevents the formation of α-synuclein fibrils<259>. By analogy to IDE, neprilysin catabolizes Aβ42 and its loss in mouse models of AD and patients alike also contributes to levels Aβ42 accumulation<253>,<256>,<260>.Another Aβ42-degrading protease, plasmin, is derived from inactive plasminogen by the actions of tissue-type plasminogen activator (urokinase), which is used to treat stroke. It is secreted by neurons (and possibly glia) into the extracellular space. Like IDE and neprilysin, plasmin degrades Aβ42 and blocks Aβ42-induced toxicity, suggesting that the decrease in its levels in AD is involved in the evolution of AD<254>,<256>,<261>. Plasmin also degrades α-synuclein to retard intercellular spreading<262>.Interestingly, certain isoforms of MMPs cleave fibrillar as well as monomeric Aβ42<254>, while extracellular α-synuclein is also a substrate for MMP-3<256>,<258>. Another protease with pharmacotherapeutic potential is angiotensin-converting enzyme, which contributes, albeit less prominently, to degradation of neurotoxic proteins in NDAs<263>. Finally, the extracellular and intracellular serine protease neurosin (kallikrein 6) cleaves α-synuclein. Levels are reduced in Lewy body dementia and, based on lentivirus transduction studies, it is a potential treatment for clearing α-synuclein in PD<264>. In AD, HD and other NDAs, disruption of the structure and function of the dynamically regulated BBB is driven, at least in part, by detrimental actions of neurotoxic proteins such as Aβ42. This permits the otherwise-restricted entry of immune cells and toxic substances into the brain. In addition, the active elimination of neurotoxic proteins like Aβ42 and tau (possibly encapsulated in exosomes) from the brain may be compromised (<Table 1> and <Figure 1>)<265>–<273>."
PMC6456907_8,"Dysregulation of BBB integrity is serious since it normally transfers neurotoxic proteins to the circulation using both generalized and specialized receptors and transporters (<Figure 1>) <265>–<267>,<270>–<272>  In addition, proteins are degraded by vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of the BBB itself<265>,<271>,<272>. In ageing, AD and PD, a diminution of BBB-localized P-glycoprotein efflux transporters compromises elimination of neurotoxic proteins<267>,<273>. There are also decreases of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) transporters in AD, whereas receptor for advanced glycolation end-products (RAGE) receptors are induced. These changes would respectively contribute to retention in, and return of, Aβ42 to the brain<270>–<272>. An ApoE4 genotype in AD exacerbates poor Aβ42 clearance by reducing its transport to the BBB and diminishing efflux<270>–<272>.Arterial pulsing aids CSF/ISF flow in flushing out interstitial extraneuronal proteins via the complementary glymphatic system (<Figure 1>)<265>,<269>,<274>,<275>. Its regulation is not well understood, but roles for aquaporin 4 water channels, other astrocytic mechanisms and noradrenaline have been documented<265>,<276>,<277>. Deletion of aquaporin 4 in astrocytes markedly reduced glymphatic flow and aggravated Aβ42 accumulation in a genetic mouse model of AD<276>,<278>, while aquaporin-4 expression is altered in the ageing, AD and PD brain<276>,<277>. Loss of sleep has been linked to an impairment of glymphatic clearance and Aβ42 accumulation<274>. This is significant since “rapid eye-movement sleep-behavior disorder” is the most robust predictor of PD, while insomnia and anomolous sleep patterns occur in other NDAs like early-onset AD, where disrupted sleep is correlated with alterations in Aβ levels<279>. Overexpression of neprilysin or IDE reduces levels of Aβ42 and amyloid plaque burden in senescence-accelerated mice<256>. As regards pharmacological manipulation, substances such as epigallocatechin and somatostatin promote the expression, secretion and — allosterically —catalytic activity of IDE and neprilysin in parallel with an increase in the degradation of Aβ peptides<259>,<280>. Furthermore, expression of progranulin in the hippocampus of AD mice reduces the density of amyloid plaques by enhancing the activity of neprilysin<281>. Epigenetic regulation of neprilysin at the level of histones, as exemplified by valproate, offers another potential approach to proteolytic potentiation<253>. As regards other proteases, augmentation of plasmin clearance by blockade of the plasminogen inhibitor PAI-1 (the expression of which increases with ageing and in murine models of AD) reduced Aβ levels and restored memory deficits in mouse models of AD<261>,<282>.These observations underscore the interest in proteases as targets for degradation of neurotoxic proteins<253>. Furthermore, several agents mentioned above, such as resveratrol and curcumin, induce IDE and/or neprilysin, suggesting a contribution to their actions<253>. Nonetheless, structure–activity relationships for small molecules that enhance the catalytic activity (or production) of proteases are not well-characterised<253>,<283>. Furthermore, there are issues of substrate specificity. For example, IDE degrades insulin and glucagon as well as Aβ42 and interacts with many other proteins, including the proteasome<259>. Neprilysin targets a range of substrates such as atrial natriuretic peptides and substance P, and inhibitors are employed in the therapy of heart failure,<253> while MMP activators exert deleterious as well as beneficial effects, reflecting their influence on microglia and the BBB<258>,<284>. Additional questions centre on whether any protease inducer alone could comprehensively and enduringly clear the burden of neurotoxic proteins in NDAs.Thus, further work is needed to determine to what extent potentiation of extracellular, glial and endothelial/BBB-localized proteases is a viable strategy for safely enhancing neurotoxic protein clearance in NDAs<253>,<259>. Immunotherapies [G] for neurotoxic protein clearance in NDAs have been pursued for over a decade. As reviewed elsewhere<81>,<285>, the most advanced approach is currently antibodies for sequestering extracellular pools of Aβ and tau (AD) or α−synuclein (PD)<7>,<286>. BBB antibody penetration is limited, but they may generate a ‘peripheral sink’ in addition to exerting actions centrally. Although Aβ-immunotherapy has not yet yielded an approvable treatment (examples of phase III trial failures include AN1792 (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00676143) and bapineuzumab (NCT00112073), more refined cohort selection, amyloid imaging for selection of early-disease patients, and the use of monoclonal antibodies derived from human patients such as aducanamab in MCI (NCT01397539, NCT02782975 and NCT02434718) and recruiting for Phase III (NCT02484547 and NCT0247780) offers hope for progress<287>.There are at least 5 antibodies under investigation for clearing tau, including a Phase II trial (NCT02880956) for C2N8E12 in AD<288>. Another trial (NCT02985879) is underway in post-cerebral palsy employing a single-chain antibody. This is the second tau-based Phase II trial after AADvac-1 (NCT02579252) to use an active immunotherapy approach<288>. Passive tau immunity approaches are also being tested using antibodies specific for [the PHF1 (Ser396/Thr404) epitope (ACI-35; ISRCTN13033912) and Ser409 epitope (RG1600; NCT03289143)<81>,<288>. Targeting extracellular tau to block intercellular spreading<249> should preclude the need for high antibody inclusion into cells. Antibodies such as PRX002<289> have also shown promise for reducing extracellular α-synuclein and propagation of pathology, and Phase I testing has been completed (NCT02157714 and NCT02095171)<285>.Potential problems should not be ignored, including the deposition of immune-complexes in vascular tissue, inaccessibility of tau in exosomes, and antibody-driven import of Aβ into the brain. Nonetheless, employing more effective antibodies and appropriate biomarkers, there are still reasonable prospects for achieving course-alteration with immunotherapy. The BBB is equipped with potentially targetable transporter proteins, channels and receptors (<Figure 1>)<265>–<267>,<270>–<273>. Inhibition of the α-secretase ADAM10 was found to drive LRP1-mediated extrusion of Aβ42 into the circulation<290>. In addition, LRP1 might be indirectly modulated by aquaporin 4 channels<276>–<278> and epigenetically via miRNAs<165>. Further, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme-A inhibitor, fluvastatin, upregulated LRP1 in the BBB to provoke Aβ42 extrusion<291>. The antibiotic rifampicin likewise promoted Aβ42 clearance by inducing BBB-localised LRP1 and P-glycoproteins<273>,<292>. Whether LRP1-driven uptake of Aβ42 by microglia (and hepatocytes) is involved in the favourable effects of LRP1 up-regulation remains to be clarified<271>. Interestingly, both fuvastatin and rifampicin have additional actions — including a probable induction of the ALN — that contribute to beneficial actions in models of AD<291>,<293>. As for RAGE receptors, their blockade should temper re-entry of Aβ into the brain, and exert anti-inflammatory properties<294>,<295>. However, despite promising improvement in cognition in a Phase II trial<296>, a Phase III study with azeliragon (TTP488) in AD recently failed (NCT02080364; 02916056) (http://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/phoenix.zhtml.c=254081&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2341681). Interestingly, resveratrol downregulated RAGE as well as MMP-9 — actions related to decreased hippocampal load of Aβ42<297>. Finally, at least in murine models of AD, agonists of retinoid-X receptors induce the BBB-localized P-glycoprotein ABCB1 transporter, and this may account for bexarotene-mediated Aβ clearance from the brains of AD mice<298>. Data with bexarotene remain controversial, but the principle of acting via BBB-localised transporters to encourage neurotoxic protein extrusion is clearly valid.Focused ultrasound therapy has mainly been used to enhance the entry of proteins and vectors into the brain."
PMC6456907_9,"For example, siRNA probes for knocking down Htt or, in principle, genes encoding clearance-promoting mechanisms<299>,<300>  However, it acts bi-directionally, so CNS-to-periphery transfer of neurotoxic proteins might likewise be accelerated. By targeting selective brain areas such as the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex in AD, neurotoxic proteins could be driven into the periphery. Safety is obviously an issue, but it is reassuring that gap junctions close within 6 hours or less<301>.Activation of aquaporin 4 channels on perivascular astrocytes to aid the glymphatic elimination of cerebral Aβ and other toxic proteins is a potential strategy for stimulating clearance. Both antagonists as well as positive modulators have been identified, so this seems “chemically” feasible<269>,<272>,<275>,<278>. A contrasting approach is represented by dobutamine, which stimulates arterial pulsation and the perivascular/glymphatic CSF flushing of neurotoxic proteins from the ISF via lymphatic conduits into the blood<269>,<275>. Deposition of Aβ42 in cerebral vessels impairs vascular function-flexibility and is accompanied by an upregulation of phosphodiesterase 3 in smooth muscle cells<302>. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor clinically approved for peripheral vascular disease (and an UPS activator), restored vascular reactivity, increased perivascular drainage of Aβ and promoted cognitive performance in a mouse model of cerebral β-amyloidogenesis<302>. Intriguingly, a retrospective clinical analysis suggested that cilostazol (added onto donepezil abrogates cognitive decline in patients with modest dementia<303>. Adrenergic mechanisms influence ISF volume and hence neurotoxic protein clearance<274>, and additional pharmacological opportunities for promoting glymphatic efflux will probably emerge from an improved understanding of its regulation by astrocytic, neurotransmitter and other mechanisms<269>,<272>,<274>.Disruption of sleep impedes glymphatic clearance of neurotoxic proteins, so encouraging sleep hygiene should promote CSF/ISF transfer to the periphery<274>,<275>. The atypical antidepressant and sleep-promoting agent trazodone is of interest since it normalized an over-protracted UPR and accordingly reversed pathology in animal models of tauopathies (<Suppl Box 2>)<99>. Other therapies that favour sleep in NDAs may improve glymphatic clearance of proteotoxic substrates and hence abate disease progression<265>,<269>,<279>. Interestingly, alcohol displays a J-shaped curve, with low/high consumption respectively enhancing/reducing glymphatic function, and moderating/aggravating the risk of dementia<304>.Finally, in a recent study in human subjects, peritoneal dialysis cleared peripheral Aβ from the circulation, while parallel experiments in APP/PS1 mice showed that peritoneal dialysis reduced ISF and brain Aβ load and ameliorated behavioural deficits<305>. Accumulation of neurotoxic proteins unquestionably contributes to the onset and progression of NDAs. Accordingly, agents that promote their elimination are attractive as potential therapeutic agents. Nonetheless, several issues remain to be resolved prior to successful and safe clinical exploitation.First, improved knowledge of the causes, characteristics and chronology of poor clearance in NDAs, and of similarities and differences amongst them, would be important for clarifying which therapeutic strategy is best adapted to the treatment of specific classes of NDA and subsets of patients. This would also help determine the optimal mode, timing, pattern and dosage of treatment<4>.Second, it is important to better understand the interplay between neurotoxic protein clearance and other pathophysiological processes, such as neuroinflammation. Moreover, hub proteins such as AMPK, mTORC1 and sirtuin 1 affect both the ALN and manifold other processes implicated in NDAs, such as epigenetic regulation and energy homeostasis<21>,<24>,<25>,<306>,<307>. Hence, drugs that modulate their activity may have beneficial and/or deleterious actions beyond their influence on clearance. Indeed, potential side-effects should not be ignored. This is exemplified by mTORC1 antagonists such as rapamycin, which possess immune-suppressive actions and affect memory formation, although studies in oncology and neurodevelopmental disorders are reassuring<5>,<307>.Third, numerous mechanisms remain to be pharmacologically harnessed. These include receptor tyrosine kinases for the ALN and “upstream” GPCRs potentially for all modes of elimination<26>,<27>,<29>. For the ALN, additional targets include the Vps34 complex, histone deacetylase 6<3>, Rab proteins implicated in autophagosome–lysosome fusion<186> and v-ATPase, crucial for lysosomal acidification<40>. There has been much recent progress towards manipulation of the UPS, whereas exploitation of the CMA remains a major challenge<2>,<3>,<45>–<47>,<68>,<80>. For certain targets, novel platforms such as PROTACS, aptamers and RNA probes, as well as nanoparticles and nucleic acid-based therapeutics, may prove useful (<Box 3>). Novel technologies will also be of importance for achieving the specific clearance of neurotoxic versus “normal” proteins, and for directing actions to discrete cells and brain regions, such as dopaminergic pathways in PD<8>,<45>. Further research is needed to confirm, clarify and potentially exploit the role of glymphatic clearance in the elimination of neurotoxic proteins in NDAs<308>. Another line of research could focus on the blood–CSF-barrier, which has parallels and differences to the BBB, is affected in ageing. It also represents a potential site for acceleration of neurotoxic protein elimination; its contribution to clearance of Aβ42 is diminished in AD<269>,<272>,<309>,<310>. <309>,<310><272>.Fourth, to improve the preclinical characterization of candidate medicines, we need more refined cellular and animal models, including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients (<Box 1>)<1>,<3>,<4>,<10>,<23>. This will help to determine precisely which components of the ALN, CMA and UPS are affected by specific classes of medication, and to quantify their influence on overall ALN flux. Improved models should also help determine the influence of therapeutic agents on clearance in discrete classes of neuron in comparison to astrocytes and microglia, which may well require contrasting modes of manipulation. Improved models and measures should also facilitate the development of translational readouts for clinical trials. Studies of the multi-functional ALN promoter and aggregation inhibitor, methylene blue, exemplify challenges faced in patient selection, trial design, dose–response relationships, readouts of efficacy and optimal time of intervention (<Suppl Table 1>).Fifth, improved clearance may well have a broad therapeutic time-window, yet early treatment would be advantageous, especially as regards reinforcement of the UPS and CMA before aggregation predominates. Hence, reliable biomarkers of clearance will be important for detecting pre-symptomatic subjects for early intervention<81>,<311>. Biomarkers are likewise crucial for demonstration of target engagement and as surrogate signals of disease-slowing and long-term efficacy. While we cannot directly monitor ALN, CMA or UPS in human brain, quantification of CSF and plasma levels of neurotoxic proteins like Aβ42 and tau is instructive. Furthermore, imaging of neurotoxic protein load is helping enrollment of subjects into clinical trials<311>. In addition, retinal imaging offers a window on cerebral clearance of tau<312> while biomarkers of neurovascular flow from the brain to the circulation are under development<265>,<275>.Sixth, the therapeutic strategies evoked herein are pertinent to other classes of NDA. For example, Machado-Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia type-3) is an autosomal-dominant, polyglutamine disease provoked by over-repetition of a CAG sequence in the ataxin3 gene. The mutant protein destabilizes beclin 1<94>. Accordingly, studies in transgenic mice and fibroblasts from patients suggest that reinforcing beclin 1-dependent ALN flux would be beneficial<313>,<314>."
PMC6456907_10,"Blockade of mTOR1 to induce autophagy (and the UPS) may likewise be useful Finally, reinforcing clearance might best be undertaken in association with other strategies like suppression of protein misfolding, amelioration of cerebral energetics, or moderation of neuroinflammation<2>,<3>,<7>,<25>,<164>,<181>,. Drug associations or multi-target agents possessing complementary mechanisms of action are both viable options. In addition, therapies for promoting neurotoxic protein clearance will probably prove most effective when used in conjunction with lifestyle changes such as improved sleep hygiene, exercise and a healthy diet. An excessive neurotoxic protein load is a core pathophysiological feature underlying and driving NDAs. Amongst several potential strategies for alleviating this burden, an enhancement of clearance is particularly attractive in view of the range of options available, and because insufficent elimination is itself implicated in the pathogenesis of NDAs. While challenges remain, ALN, CMA, UPS, proteolytic, neurovascular and lymphatic mechanisms of clearance offer potentially important strategies for preventing the onset and progression of diverse classes of NDA. rhetorical Figure 1 | Neurotoxic proteins (NTPs) are eliminated by a broad suite of specific and non-specific mechanisms in neurons, glial cells and endothelial/vascular smooth muscle cells of vessels. The three major modes of intracellular clearance — the autophagic–lysosomal network (ALN), chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) — are shown for neurons but they are also active in other cells such as microglia. Under conditions of inflammation, proteasomal β-subunits in glia are switched and substrate specificity changes: the precise role of these ‘immunoproteasomes’ — specialized in peptide production for antigen presentation — for neurotoxic protein elimination in NDAs is debated<8>. Clearance also occurs in the extracellular space, the interstitial fluid (ISF) of the brain parenchyma that surrounds neurons, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with which the ISF exchanges. Intraneuronal mechanisms of clearance are illustrated for NTPs in general, but only Aβ42 is shown for extracellular clearance, since the vast majority of currently available data is for this NTP. Extracellular pools of NTPs are derived from passive diffusion, active release from terminals, extrusion by exocytosis, and dispersion upon cell death. NTPs disrupt neuronal and synaptic function and are taken up by other neurons and glial cells (‘spreading’). Therapeutically relevant proteases degrading NTPs include endothelin-converting enzyme and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) (mainly cytosolic), neprilysin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (intracellular and extracellular), and plasmin (mainly extracellular). NTPs that escape glial capture and proteases are driven into the circulation. First, blood–brain barrier (BBB) localised receptors and transporters actively eject them into the blood, including P-glycoproteins such as ABCB1 transporters and low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1). Conversely, the receptor for advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) receptor returns Aβ into the CNS. Similar mechanisms operate at the blood–CSF barrier in the choroid plexus; for example, LRP2 transfer of transthyretin-bound Aβ from CSF into blood. Second, transfer of NTPs to the periphery is mediated through the glymphatic system. CSF runs along the peri-arterial space, transverses aquaporin 4 receptor-bearing circumvascular astrocytes to enter the ISF. Convective flow driven by arterial pulsing flushes NTPs via glial cells and the peri-venous space back into the CSF. Glymphatic-cleared, CSF-derived NTPs mainly reach the circulation mainly via the cervical lymph nodes, but also via the dural venous sinus. Within the blood, specific proteins sequester Aβ, such as the soluble fragment of LRP1 and immunoglobulins (IgG). NTPs are ultimately eliminated in the kidneys and liver. Abbreviation not in main text or above: s, soluble. rhetorical Figure 2 | Within neurons and other classes of cell, the UPS and CMA clear non-aggregated forms of neurotoxic protein, and the UPS also deals with substrates of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of incorrectly-folded proteins. Proteins destined for the proteasome are poly-ubiquinated and guided to the proteasome by chaperones. They are deubiquinated by Rpn11 once committed to entering the proteosome pore: other deubiquitinases such as USP14 may rescue them before entry<49>. Unfolding is followed by degradation. The CMA operates on proteins bearing a KFERQ-like motif. This sequence is found in, for example, tau but not Aβ. Hsc70 recognises the KFERQ sequence and, together with co-chaperones, transports the protein to the LAMP2A receptor on lysosomes: LAMP2A then coordinates protein translocation into the lumen. The ALN is the major system for removing misfolded, higher-order, aggregated proteins as well as damaged organelles. Autophagosomes bearing cargo fuse with acidic lysosomes, leading to degradation of contents. In addition, some autophagosomes fuse with late endosomes. The resultant amphisomes then likewise fuse with lysosomes. See also <Figure 3>. Abbreviation not in main text: Co-chap, co-chaperone; Lys, lysine and Ub, ubiquitin, rhetorical Figure 3 | The top part of the figure illustrates the sequence of steps associated with operation of the ALN, while the bottom part shows the main regulatory proteins involved, focusing on potential targets for pharmacotherapy. ‘Sensing’ — both extrinsic (for example, glucose levels) and intrinsic (e.g. for example, ATP/AMP levels) — can determine whether or not autophagy is initiated by activation of AMPK and/or inhibition of mTORC1, which leads to TFEB-driven transcription of ALN-requisite proteins. The pre-autophagosome (phagophore) structure first emerges from diverse membrane sources, and its formation is promoted by Atg9 (not shown). Nucleation is accomplished with the help of a complex cluster of proteins. Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) is recognised by WIPI (WD-repeat-protein-interacting-with-phosphoInositides) proteins that help induce autophagosome elongation in association with several classes of Atg protein and small GTPases such as Rab5. With the aid of LC3 and cargo acceptors, autophagosomes take up cytoplasmic material such as aggregated proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria (<Box 2>). Autophagosomes and other autophagic vesicles are transported with the help of dynactin and dynein along microtubules towards acidic lysosomes. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes containing resident hydrolases that degrade their contents into amino acids, sugars and lipids for recycling. Exosomal release/secretion of neurotoxic proteins (“exocytosis)”) may occur upon reduced ALN flux and accumulation of autophagosomes. For details, see main text.

The principal loci of drug actions are depicted, yet precise mechanisms of action remain to be more fully deciphered for many drugs while several agents like resveratrol act at multiple sites (main text). As illustrated, a broad range of drugs exert their actions via AMPK, mTORC1 or sirtuin 1 (which also influences downstream events such as autophagosome formation). Some agents exert their effects via other components of the ALN, up to and including lysosomal catabolism. In addition, ambroxol acts as a chaperone to help transport β−glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes."

Neurodegenerative disorders of ageing (NDAs) such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis represent a major socio-economic challenge in view of their high prevalence yet poor treatment. They are often called proteinopathies owing to the presence of misfolded and aggregated proteins that lose their physiological roles and acquire neurotoxic properties. One reason underlying the accumulation and spread of oligomeric forms of neurotoxic proteins is insufficient clearance by the autophagic–lysosomal network."
PMC6456907_13,"Several other clearance pathways are likewise compromised in NDAs: chaperone-mediated autophagy, the ubiquitin–proteasome system, extracellular clearance by proteases and extrusion into the circulation via the blood–brain barrier and glymphatic system  This article focuses on emerging mechanisms for enhancing neurotoxic protein clearance, a strategy that may curtail the onset and slow the progression of NDAs. ."
PMC5378766_0,"Aging has long been considered as the main risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders including a large group of diseases known as tauopathies. Even though neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) have been examined as the main histopathological hallmark, they do not seem to play a role as the toxic entities leading to disease. Recent studies suggest that an intermediate form of tau, prior to NFT formation, the tau oligomer, is the true toxic species. However, the mechanisms by which tau oligomers trigger neurodegeneration remain unknown. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the role of tau oligomers in disease, including release from cells, propagation from affected to unaffected brain regions, uptake into cells, and toxicity via mitochondrial dysfunction. A greater understanding of tauopathies may lead to future advancements in regards to prevention and treatment. This work was supported by funds from NIH National Institute for Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD) award 4U54MD008621-04. We thank Ms. Urmi Sengupta and Julia Gerson for contributing to the editing process. Neurodegenerative diseases are a leading cause of death and disability affecting millions of elderly. As life expectancies rise, growing numbers of elderly become affected. This emerges as a major global issue as there are currently no adequate remedies for these diseases. A large group of these diseases, which are related to tau, a microtubule-associated protein, are known as tauopathies. Most notably, tauopathies include Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), corticobasal degeneration, and variants of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD; Goedert et al., <2000>; Hutton, <2000>; Spillantini et al., <2000>). These share a common histopathological hallmark known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that consist of an accumulation of fibrillar tau deposits initially produced from tau protein aggregation (Ballatore et al., <2007>).While functional tau is an unfolded monomeric protein that stabilizes microtubules, regulates neurite growth, and monitors axonal transport of organelles (Medina and Avila, <2014>), dysfunctional tau acquires a new toxic function. NFTs, although considered a histopathological hallmark in tauopathies, do not appear to be the main toxic entities leading to disease (Gerson et al., <2014b>). In AD, tau pathology and neuronal cell loss coincide in the same brain regions, and as brain dysfunction progresses, NFTs are found in greater anatomical distributions (Ihara, <2001>). However, the role of NFTs in the progression of the disease is poorly understood. Compared to non-demented controls, AD brains exhibit up to 50% of neuronal loss in the cortex, exceeding the number of NFTs (Gómez-Isla et al., <1997>). In addition, neurons containing NFTs are functionally intact in vivo (Kuchibhotla et al., <2014>) and have been found in brains of cognitively normal individuals. Further, intra-neuronal NFTs do not affect post-synaptic function and signaling cascades responsible for long-term synaptic plasticity in tauopathy mice overexpressing P301L mutant tau (Rudinskiy et al., <2014>), suggesting that synaptic deficits cannot be attributed to NFTs.While evidence has linked FTD with parkinsonism in patients to tau mutations on chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), implying that tau dysfunction alone can cause neurodegeneration (Reed et al., <2001>), studies in animal models have shown that overexpression of tau can lead to cell death (Lee et al., <2001>; Tanemura et al., <2001>, <2002>; Tatebayashi et al., <2002>) and exhibit behavioral abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction without the presence of NFTs (Wittmann et al., <2001>; Andorfer et al., <2003>; Santacruz et al., <2005>; Spires et al., <2006>; Berger et al., <2007>; Yoshiyama et al., <2007>; Cowan et al., <2010>). Others have noted neuronal loss without NFT presence in a Drosophila model overexpressing tau (Wittmann et al., <2001>). These studies provide evidence that progressive tau accumulation in neurodegeneration may not require NFT formation (Maeda et al., <2006>). Indeed, reducing tau overexpression in mutant tau transgenic mice decreases neuronal cell loss even though NFTs continue to form (Santacruz et al., <2005>). This indicates that NFT formation is not essential for neuronal loss.While evidence indicates that these deposits are not toxic, many studies suggest that the tau oligomer, an intermediate entity, is likely responsible for disease onset. Hyper-phosphorylated tau assembles into small aggregates known as tau oligomers in route of NFT formation. As hyper-phosphorylated tau dislodges from microtubules, its affinity for other tau monomers leads individual tau to bind each other, forming oligomeric tau, a detergent-soluble aggregate. These tau oligomers potentiate neuronal damage, leading to neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury (Hawkins et al., <2013>; Gerson et al., <2014a>, <2016>; Sengupta et al., <2015>). Moreover, they have been implicated in synaptic loss as shown in studies of wild-type human tau transgenic mice (Spires et al., <2006>; Berger et al., <2007>; Clavaguera et al., <2013>). When the oligomer lengthens, it adapts a β-sheet structure and transforms into a detergent-insoluble aggregate with granular appearance under Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). As these granular tau oligomers fuse together, they form tau fibrils, which ultimately form NFTs (Takashima, <2013>). These steps hint that tau oligomers may be involved in neuronal dysfunction prior to NFT formation (Maeda et al., <2006>).The onset of clinical symptoms in AD and PSP brains correlate with elevated levels of tau oligomer (Maeda et al., <2006>, <2007>; Patterson et al., <2011>; Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2012b>; Gerson et al., <2014a>). When tau oligomers, rather than tau monomers or fibrils, are injected into the brain of wild-type mice, cognitive, synaptic, and mitochondrial abnormalities follow (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2011>; Castillo-Carranza et al., <2014b>). Additionally, studies have discovered that aggregated tau inhibits fast axonal transport in the anterograde direction at all physiological tau levels, whereas tau monomers have had no effect in either direction (LaPointe et al., <2009>; Morfini et al., <2009>). This suggests that monomers are not the toxic entity either. Most noteworthy, tau oligomers induce endogenous tau to misfold and propagate from affected to unaffected brain regions in mice, whereas fibrils do not (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2012a>,<b>; Wu et al., <2013>). This indicates that tauopathies progress via a prion-like mechanism dependent upon tau oligomers (Gerson and Kayed, <2013>; Castillo-Carranza et al., <2014b>). With this concept, tau may be able to translocate between neurons and augment toxic tau components; in fact, evidence suggests probability of tau oligomer propagation between synaptically connected neurons (Gendreau and Hall, <2013>; Pooler et al., <2013b>). If true, then pathology begins in a small area and becomes symptomatic as it spreads to other areas of the brain (Medina and Avila, <2014>). Studies show that tau pathology progresses from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, eventually leading to the limbic and association cortex; this progression explains the individuals clinical cognitive status (Nelson et al., <2012>). Further, mice injected with tau oligomers in the proximity of the hippocampus experienced immediate memory impairment (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2011>). These studies demonstrate that tau oligomers may be the toxic entities responsible for neurodegeneration in tauopathies (Ward et al., <2012>). Tau predominantly presents as an axonal cytoplasmic protein, however evidence has shown tau at the pre- and post-synapse in human brains (Tai et al., <2012>) as well as at the post-synapse in mouse brains (Ittner et al., <2010>). Further, tau directly interacts with synaptic proteins, including the NMDA receptor (Ittner et al., <2010>; Mondragón-Rodríguez et al., <2012>)."
PMC5378766_1,"This hints that tau plays a role in monitoring intracellular signaling pathways (Pooler and Hanger, <2010>)  Related evidence indicates that synaptic activity leads to tau monomer release (Pooler et al., <2013a>; Yamada et al., <2014>). Yet whether the movement of aggregates across the synapse occurs easily from nearby cells taking up released aggregated material at the axon terminal or whether the movement depends on activity is unknown.Tau is also present outside the cell in brain fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. In AD, the quantity of tau identified in the CSF increases with disease progression (Hampel et al., <2010>). However, the mechanism of tau propagation from the brain to the CSF remains elusive. Recently, tau was discovered in the interstitial fluid of awake, wild-type mice, suggesting its release by neurons in the absence of neurodegeneration (Yamada et al., <2011>). This evidence suggests that tau secretion is an active neuronal process separate from cell death (Saman et al., <2012>; Pooler et al., <2013a>).In AD, misfolded and hyper-phosphorylated tau concentrates in various components of the neuron: dendrites, cell body, and axons (Avila et al., <2004>). Hence, propagation of disease may depend on transport within neurons. Further, transgenic mouse lines expressing human tau aggregates in the entorhinal cortex have shown that tau is mislocalized from axons to cell bodies and dendrites as the mice age (Pooler et al., <2013b>). Nevertheless, given that tau is detected in both axons and dendrites, it is possible that either region may be involved in its secretion (Pooler et al., <2013b>). Extracellular tau is implicated as the primary agent during propagation of neurofibrillary lesions and spreading of tau toxicity (Medina and Avila, <2014>). In trans-synaptic propagation, tau can be released and taken up by a synaptically-connected neuron (Clavaguera et al., <2009>; Dujardin et al., <2014b>; Dennissen et al., <2016>). A recent study showed that neuronal networks facilitate cell-to-cell transfer of tau via synapses; using a microfluidic device they demonstrated that decreasing synaptic connections weakens tau transfer and the subsequent aggregation on the acceptor cell (Calafate et al., <2015>).Determining the mechanism behind the propagation of misfolded tau protein from one cell to another is currently of great significance in research. In AD, tau pathology has been found to spread from the transentorhinal cortex to the neocortex in a sequential pathway. This prion-like spreading of tau may occur throughout neuronal connections. However, the method of tau oligomer release via the cell and its spread is still unknown.The prion concept suggests that a protein can be transformed into a disease-causing form when in contact with a pathogenic protein “seed.” The mechanism for the transformation is not well-understood; however, it includes templated conformational change (Telling et al., <1996>) and is demonstrated to propagate through neural networks. Thus, the prion hypothesis serves as a useful model when testing ideas regarding propagation of protein pathology.In trans-cellular propagation, tau aggregates escape from afflicted neurons into the extracellular space prior to entering adjacent or synaptically-connected cells. This suggests that extracellular tau may be susceptible to antibody-mediated therapies. According to this model, misfolded tau is released into the extracellular space and then gains entry into adjacent or synaptically-connected cells to trigger further aggregate formation via templated conformational change. Recently, more evidence implies that the secretion of tau occurs through unconventional cellular pathways via vesicles known as exosomes (Saman et al., <2012>) and ectosomes (Dujardin et al., <2014a>).Exosomes are small membranous vesicles ranging from 30 to 100 nm, which are secreted from most cell types, including neurons. Exosomes have been identified in several body fluids (Witwer et al., <2013>; Khalyfa and Gozal, <2014>). They are made by the endocytosis of molecules and can assist in spreading pathology. Once taken up by a cell, the molecules inside the exosomes are either recycled to the plasma membrane or transported to multivesicular bodies (MVBs; Dujardin et al., <2014a>). The fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane results in exosomal release (Mathivanan et al., <2010>). AD brain samples contain exosomal proteins within amyloid plaques hinting that exosomes play part in disease pathology (Rajendran et al., <2006>). Tau, like other amyloidogenic proteins, may be secreted and spread via exosomal vesicles (Danzer et al., <2012>; Asai et al., <2015>). In support, tau associated with exosomes and phosphorylated at Thr-181 (AT270+ tau) has been identified in human CSF samples of AD patients. More recently, patients affected with FTD and AD, were found to have high levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau (p-T181 and p-S396; Saman et al., <2012>). Further, peripheral exosomes extracted from AD cases, propagate tau pathology in the brain of normal mice (Winston et al., <2016>). It was recently shown that microglial cells may facilitate tau spreading via exosomes. The authors speculated that microglia phagocytose tau-containing neurons or synapses and secrete tau protein via exosomes (Asai et al., <2015>). Further investigation is needed to determine if predominant tau aggregates are released via this unconventional pathway.Exosomes are not the only vesicles that may spread pathology. Ectosomes are also extracellular vesicles, but range from 50 to 1,000 nm. They directly shed from cells by budding from the plasma membrane (Piccin et al., <2007>; Cocucci et al., <2009>; Théry et al., <2009>; Davizon et al., <2010>). Ectosomes are contenders in secreting tau protein since they are released via cell membrane activation by fluctuating intracellular levels of calcium, inflammatory molecules, or oxidative stress (Piccin et al., <2007>; Doeuvre et al., <2009>). Significantly, evidence suggests that tau secretion is partly mediated by ectosomal vesicles and that pathological tau accumulation in cells leads to a deviation toward tau secretion by exosomal vesicles (Dujardin et al., <2014a>). These studies provide further evidence that extracellular vesicles play an important role in disease pathogenesis (Figure <1>). rhetorical Figure 1 Propagation of tau oligomers. Schematic representation of free or exosomal tau oligomers release, local or trans-synaptic. In local transmission, tau oligomers are released from one neuron and taken up by another neuron in the vicinity. In trans-synaptic transmission, tau oligomers and/or exosomes containing tau oligomers are passed across the synapse of two neighboring neurons. Recently, more evidence implies that the secretion of tau occurs through unconventional cellular pathways via vesicles known as exosomes (Saman et al., <2012>) and ectosomes (Dujardin et al., <2014a>).Exosomes are small membranous vesicles ranging from 30 to 100 nm, which are secreted from most cell types, including neurons.

These studies provide further evidence that extracellular vesicles play an important role in disease pathogenesis (Figure <1>). Quite a few mechanisms involving tau uptake have been proposed. These include (1) cell internalization of soluble, uncoated tau via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Gómez-Ramos et al., <2009>), (2) dynamin-driven endocytosis of non-fibrillar, soluble tau aggregates (Wu et al., <2013>), and (3) actin-dependent, proteoglycan-mediated macropinocytosis (Holmes et al., <2013>; Figure <2>). rhetorical Figure 2 Mechanisms of tau oligomer internalization and mitochondrial damage. Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms contributing to tau oligomer internalization that may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Methods of tau oligomer internalization include (1) dynamin-driven endocytosis; (2) muscarinic (M1 and M3) receptor-mediated endocytosis; (3) proteoglycan-mediated macropinocytosis (HSPGs); (4) exosomes; and (5) annular protofibrils. Internalized tau oligomers interfere with the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inducing cytochrome c release and stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Tau oligomers induce mitochondrial fusion/fission imbalance by binding with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Tau oligomers interact with the outer membrane porin protein. Quite a few mechanisms involving tau uptake have been proposed. These include (1) cell internalization of soluble, uncoated tau via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Gómez-Ramos et al., <2009>), (2) dynamin-driven endocytosis of non-fibrillar, soluble tau aggregates (Wu et al., <2013>), and (3) actin-dependent, proteoglycan-mediated macropinocytosis (Holmes et al., <2013>; Figure <2>). Tau may be endocytosed, promoting an increase in intracellular calcium that results in neuronal death. In the former theory, endocytosed tau may interact with various cellular products, including tau itself, and can be secreted, uncoated or in a membrane vesicle. Such secreted vesicles may interact with other cells and be endocytosed in an unspecific way. In the latter theory, during the secretion, vesicles and the cell membrane can be fused and uncoated tau protein can be released to the extracellular space (Clavaguera et al., <2009>; Iba et al., <2013>).Tau can interact with muscarinic receptors; more specifically, M1 and M3 receptors have approximately a 10-fold higher affinity for tau than acetylcholine. Overstimulation with tau (as opposed to acetylcholine) does not desensitize the muscarinic receptors present on neurons of the hippocampus; hence, a repeat stimulus via tau increases intracellular calcium every time, thus altering intracellular calcium homeostasis and the following hyper-phosphorylation and misfolding of tau. Coupled with the fact that tau persists in the extracellular environment for a longer time than acetylcholine, a neurotoxic effect may occur. In other words, it is sensible to theorize that tauopathies progress via interaction of extracellular tau with M1 and M3 receptors on neurons leading to cytotoxic effects (Gómez-Ramos et al., <2009>). Thus, blocking M1 and M3 receptors via receptor antagonists can prevent cytotoxic effects (Gómez-Ramos et al., <2008>). Exogenous tau aggregates may be taken up via an active process attenuated by dynamin inhibition, supporting endocytosis-mediated internalization. Dynamin is a GTPase essential for multiple intracellular functions, including formation of vesicles from the cell membrane, endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle recycling among others (Kozlov, <1999>). Evidence shows that tau aggregates colocalize with dextran and HeLa cells, hinting that internalized aggregates are transported in endosomal vesicles and passed through the endosomal pathway to lysosomes (Wu et al., <2013>). Previous studies suggest that uptake of aggregated tau from the extracellular space depends on interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs; Holmes and Diamond, <2014>). HSPGs are cell-surface macromolecules of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains covalently attached to a core protein. HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types including neurons, and have been previously associated with dense core plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid, and NFT formation (van Horssen et al., <2001>). Consistently, HSPGs have been implicated in amyloid as well as tau fibril formation in vitro, presumably facilitated by anionic moieties. Whether deposition of amyloid-b or tau is preceded by HSPGs or vice versa, it is clear that HSPGs play a role in the stabilization and uptake of these aggregates.The recruitment of exogenous tau starts with binding HSPGs on the cell surface, stimulating macropinocytosis and bringing pathogenic “seeds” into the cell to guide trans-cellular propagation (Holmes et al., <2013>). This uptake is necessary for intracellular seeding and was previously described for the prion protein uptake (Hooper, <2011>). Even though the mechanism by which HSPGs mediate tau uptake is unknown, it seems to be confined to a specific “size” aggregate. Studies agree that small misfolded tau oligomers are readily taken up by neuronal cells (Wu et al., <2013>; Mirbaha et al., <2015>). However, regardless of the multiple “sizes” of tau aggregates that interact with the cell surface via HSPGs, it is likely that an assembly of at least three tau molecules is required to initiate endocytosis via HSPGs (Mirbaha et al., <2015>). Interestingly, trimers were identified as the toxic tau aggregate at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro (Tian et al., <2013>). Thus, tau oligomers may act as “seeds” inducing endogenous tau misfolding, suggesting a unifying mechanism for the propagation of protein amyloids (Mirbaha et al., <2015>).In other words, the HSPGs serve as a receptor for the cellular uptake of tau, a critical step similar to prion-like propagation. Basically, pathogenic tau aggregates use HSPGs to bind the cell surface of a neuron. This actively stimulates macropinocytosis, leading to propagation of aggregates between cells in culture and aggregate uptake in vivo (Holmes et al., <2013>). Further, another study implied that exosomes depend on HSPGs for internalization (Christianson et al., <2013>). As delineated above, exosomes are a distinct mechanism for propagation of misfolded tau. A handful of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases have been found to produce pore-like amyloid structures known as annular protofibrils (APFs). APFs are similar to pore-forming protein toxins in that their properties lead to membrane disruption. A recent study showed the existence of tau APFs in human brain samples from patients with PSP and LBD as well as in mice brain samples which overexpressed mutated tau. The study discovered that APFs form after tau oligomer formation and bypass higher NFT aggregate formation."
PMC5378766_3,"The findings showed that APF formation relies on mutations in tau, phosphorylation levels, and cell type (Lasagna-Reeves et al , <2014>). Hence, tau APFs may play a significant role in tauopathies by linking pore formation to cell death. Oligomeric tau intermediates decrease cell viability (Flach et al., <2012>). In aging, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), can bind tau abnormally, inducing neurodegeneration via mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure <2>; DuBoff et al., <2012>). Specifically, studies have shown reduced levels of mitochondrial proteins and activity in the brains of AD patients (Kim et al., <2001>). One study showed diminished NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) activity and injury to mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis (complex V) with age in P301L mice (David et al., <2005>). Another study showed that expression of tau (truncated at Asp-421 to mimic caspase cleavage) caused mitochondrial dysfunction (Quintanilla et al., <2009>).Recently, data has shown that injected tau oligomers co-localize with the mitochondrial marker porin, suggesting a pathological relationship. In fact, tau oligomers might disrupt microtubule stability and trafficking, thus affecting organelle distribution. Mitochondria navigate long distances to provide for synaptic energy demand; therefore, inhibiting transport systems impairs energy production routes (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2011>).Also, data shows low levels of complex I in brain hemispheres injected with tau oligomers when compared to brains injected with monomers or fibrils. This implies that alterations of complex I subunit mRNA, minimization in protein levels of complex I subunits (Kim et al., <2001>), and other effects of mitochondrial damage (David et al., <2005>) can be observed due to tau accumulation without the presence of NFT formation. Further, since tau oligomers hinder energy production through complex I, alterations in synaptically-localized mitochondria may result. However, recent data considering complex V levels suggested that tau oligomers do not implicate ATP synthesis initially. These results imply that tau oligomers initially affect complex I activity and may directly or indirectly disturb the later stage of complex V ATP synthesis (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2011>).Mitochondrial damage can lead to activation of the apoptotic pathway. Hemispheres injected with tau oligomers were found to have increased levels of caspase-9 activation (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2011>). Suggestively, as tau oligomers concentrate at the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome C is released, leading to caspase-9 activation via a complex with apoptotic-peptidase-activating-factor-1 (Apaf-1; Li et al., <1997>). The relationship between cytochrome C and caspase-9 has been noted for other amyloidogenic proteins (Hashimoto et al., <1999>; Simoneau et al., <2007>). Moreover, caspase activation occurs before NFT formation, implying that a soluble tau entity may be the main toxic moiety (de Calignon et al., <2010>).Overall, evidence suggests that tau oligomers are the toxic entities in tau aggregation and that alteration of the mitochondrial membrane, minimization in complex I levels, and activation of the apoptotic-related caspase-9 can cause toxicity, impeding synaptic energy production (Lasagna-Reeves et al., <2011>). Discovering the pathological role of tau oligomers within the brain along with related mechanisms of cellular tau oligomer secretion, propagation, and uptake will allow for a better understanding of tauopathies (Castillo-Carranza et al., <2013>, <2014a>; Gerson et al., <2014b>). Further, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by internalized tau oligomers may play an important role in pathogenesis. Admittedly, little is known regarding cellular tau oligomer release. Yet with greater knowledge regarding disease pathogenesis, better therapeutic approaches can be generated. We hypothesize that preventing tau oligomers from cellular release and uptake via exosomal or ectosomal pathways will relieve some toxic effects induced by tau oligomers in tauopathies.

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. Aging has long been considered as the main risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders including a large group of diseases known as tauopathies. Even though neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) have been examined as the main histopathological hallmark, they do not seem to play a role as the toxic entities leading to disease. Recent studies suggest that an intermediate form of tau, prior to NFT formation, the tau oligomer, is the true toxic species. However, the mechanisms by which tau oligomers trigger neurodegeneration remain unknown. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the role of tau oligomers in disease, including release from cells, propagation from affected to unaffected brain regions, uptake into cells, and toxicity via mitochondrial dysfunction. A greater understanding of tauopathies may lead to future advancements in regards to prevention and treatment. ."
PMC4047864_0,"The presence of tangles composed of phosphorylated tau is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau, a microtubule (MT)-associated protein, accumulates in AD potentially as a result of posttranslational modifications, such as hyperphosphorylation and conformational changes. However, it has not been fully understood how tau accumulation and phosphorylation are deregulated. In the present study, we identified a novel role of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in the regulation of the tau protein. We found that hippocampal DAPK1 expression is markedly increased in the brains of AD patients compared with age-matched normal subjects. DAPK1 overexpression increased tau protein stability and phosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites. In contrast, inhibition of DAPK1 by overexpression of a DAPK1 kinase-deficient mutant or by genetic knockout significantly decreased tau protein stability and abolished its phosphorylation in cell cultures and in mice. Mechanistically, DAPK1-enhanced tau protein stability was mediated by Ser71 phosphorylation of Pin1, a prolyl isomerase known to regulate tau protein stability, phosphorylation, and tau-related pathologies. In addition, inhibition of DAPK1 kinase activity significantly increased the assembly of MTs and accelerated nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth. Given that DAPK1 has been genetically linked to late onset AD, these results suggest that DAPK1 is a novel regulator of tau protein abundance, and that DAPK1 upregulation might contribute to tau-related pathologies in AD. Therefore, we offer that DAPK1 might be a novel therapeutic target for treating human AD and other tau-related pathologies.

Tau-related pathology (tauopathy) is involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders.<1>, <2>, <3>, <4> In these diseases, tau is commonly hyperphosphorylated on serine or threonine residues prior to tangle formation and neurodegeneration.<5>, <6>, <7> Tau helps stabilize the microtubule (MT) network in neurons,<8>, <9>, <10>, <11> and aberrant tau phosphorylation disrupts its MT function<12>, <13>, <14> and alters its protein stability.<15>, <16>, <17>, <18>, <19> In all tauopathies, aberrantly phosphorylated tau adopts abnormal conformations and aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).<5>, <6>, <7> The significance of tau phosphorylation is further supported by the findings that tau kinases<20>, <21>, <22> or phosphatases<23>, <24> are deregulated in AD and that their modulation can affect tauopathies.<25>, <26>, <27> However, how tau accumulation and phosphorylation are deregulated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, is not fully understood.Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a death domain-containing calcium/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine kinase, functions as a positive mediator of apoptosis.<28> DAPK1 overexpression promotes neuronal cell death, and neurons lacking DAPK1 are less susceptible to apoptotic insults in cell culture and knockout (KO) animal models.<28> Furthermore, DAPK1 regulates tau toxicity by modulating MT assembly and neuronal differentiation,<29> and influences brain damage via the N-methyl-D aspartate receptor in stroke.<30> Moreover, genome-wide association study showed that two gene-centric single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the DAPK1 are strongly associated with late-onset AD.<31>, <32> Indeed, mice expressing DAPK1 kinase domain deletions showed enhanced learning and spatial memory compared with wild-type (WT) mice.<33> However, the association between DAPK1 and late-onset AD has not been sufficiently explored, as little is known about the downstream targets of DAPK1 in AD, and DAPK1 regulation in AD progression is poorly understood.We showed previously that DAPK1 phosphorylates Ser71 in the catalytic active site of Pin1, thereby inhibiting its cellular function.<34> Pin1, a unique peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase, is an enzyme that has a critical role in regulating a subset of phosphoproteins by specifically catalyzing conformational change on the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs.<35>, <36> In line with its diverse physiological role, Pin1 has been linked to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including AD, Parkinson disease, cancer, and asthma.<35>, <36> Moreover, Pin1 has an important protective role in the brain against AD by maintaining tau and amyloid precursor protein in their proper forms.<37>, <38>, <39>, <40> Pin1 is also colocalized with phosphorylated tau in AD brain and other tauopathies.<41> It binds to and isomerizes the pThr231-Pro motif in tau to restore its ability to bind MTs and to promote their assembly.<40> Therefore, loss of Pin1 function can lead to abnormal tau protein accumulation and MT disintegration, which are the main features of AD. Although DAPK1 inhibits the tumorigenic properties of Pin1, it is not known whether DAPK1 regulates Pin1 function during neurodegeneration.In this study, we found that DAPK1 enhanced tau stability and phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting its cellular function. Furthermore, we showed that DAPK1-dependent tau regulation might be mediated by Pin1 Ser71 phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time a potential role for DAPK1 in the regulation of tau accumulation and function in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. As DAPK1 polymorphisms are associated with AD susceptibility,<31>, <32> we first investigated potential association between late onset AD and DAPK1 expression. Considering DAPK1 expression is restricted to the hippocampus of the adult brain,<42> hippocampal DAPK1 levels were measured in a cohort of 12 AD patients and 12 age-matched normal subjects. The expression of DAPK1 was found to increase more than two-fold in the AD patients compared with that of normal subjects (<Figures 1a and b>). Moreover, phosphorylated Thr231 or Ser396 of tau was highly overexpressed in the brains of AD patients, as describe previously (<Figure 1a>).<12>, <43> DAPK1 mRNA levels were also increased in AD brains compared with normal brains, but this difference was not statistically significant, implying that DAPK1 upregulation in AD is a consequence of increased translation and/or stability of the DAPK1 protein (<Figure 1c>). Thus, these results showed that in human AD brains DAPK1 was upregulated, and this might be correlated with tau phosphorylation. To examine whether DAPK1 contributes to age-dependent neurodegeneration in AD via tau regulation, we determined the effect of DAPK1 on tau protein expression. DAPK1 significantly increased exogenous tau protein levels compared with the vector control (<Figure 2a>). We further examined tau protein expression using DAPK1 mutants, which have been characterized previously.<44> DAPK1K42A, a kinase-deficient mutant, downregulated, whereas DAPK1ΔCaM, a constitutively active mutant, upregulated exogenous tau protein expression compared with the vector control (<Figure 2a>). Endogenous tau expression was assessed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the vector control, DAPK1, DAPK1K42A, or DAPK1ΔCaM and was found to be upregulated in DAPK1- and DAPK1ΔCaM-expressing cells compared with the vector control- or DAPK1K42A-expressing cells (<Figure 2b>). Similar trends were observed in another neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH (<Supplementary Figure 1>)."
PMC4047864_1,"Next, we efficiently knocked down the expression of endogenous DAPK1 using lentiviral-mediated small hairpin RNAs (sh-RNAs) or small interfering RNAs (si-RNAs) in the SH-SY5Y cells (<Figures 2c and d>)  In contrast with the control cells, endogenous tau expression was decreased dramatically in DAPK1 knockdown cells (<Figures 2c and d>). However, there was no increase in tau mRNA levels after overexpression of DAPK1 or DAPK1K42A (<Figure 2e>), suggesting that DAPK1 does not affect tau at the level of transcription but rather at the protein level. Thus, DAPK1 increases exogenous and endogenous tau protein expression in cells.Given that DAPK1 increased tau protein levels but not transcription, the next question was whether DAPK1 might affect tau protein stability. The exogenous- and endogenous tau protein were quite stable in cells expressing DAPK1 or DAPK1ΔCaM but not DAPK1K42A, compared with cells expressing the vector control (<Figures 3a, b, e and f>). We also used lentiviral expression systems to generate NIH3T3 cells expressing DAPK1 in a tetracycline-inducible manner, as described:<34> the addition of the tetracycline analoge, doxycycline, into the growth medium resulted in the production of DAPK1 (<Supplementary Figure 2>). Doxycycline-induced expression of DAPK1 efficiently enhanced tau protein stability compared with the vector control (<Figures 3c and d>). Altogether, these results suggest that DAPK1 overexpression inhibits tau protein turnover in cells. Recent studies by our group and others reported that Pin1 regulates tau phosphorylation, protein stability, function and tauopathy<37>, <38>, <40> and that DAPK1 negatively regulates Pin1 activity through Ser71 phosphorylation.<34> It was also shown that the MT-affinity regulating kinase (MARK) 1/2 is activated by DAPK1 to phosphorylate tau on Ser262, regulating its toxicity.<29> To examine whether DAPK1-enhanced tau stability is dependent upon the inhibition of Pin1 and/or the activation of MARK1/2, we generated tau point mutations, tauT231A, which is unable to bind Pin1, and tauS262A, which is resistant to MARK1/2 phosphorylation. When the T231A tau mutant was co-transfected with DAPK1 or the vector control, tauT231A expression levels were not increased in DAPK1-expressing cells compared with the vector control (<Figure 4a>). Moreover, the stability of T231A tau protein was not affected by either DAPK1 or DAPK1K42A (<Figures 4b and c>), suggesting that Pin1 action on phosphorylated Thr231 is necessary for DAPK1-regulated tau protein stability. However, expression and stability of the S262A protein were increased by DAPK1 expression, but not by DAPK1K42A, compared with the vector control (<Figures 4d–f>), similar to the results with the WT tau protein. These results indicate that MARK proteins are not involved in the effects of DAPK1 on tau protein stability. Taken together, our data show that DAPK1 regulates tau protein expression and stability, presumably through tau Thr231 and Pin1 phosphorylation. We further investigated the role of Pin1 by examining tau protein turnover using DAPK1 KO and Pin1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, which were confirmed for the absence of DAPK1 and Pin1 protein, respectively (<Supplementary Figure 3>). When we transfected WT tau into DAPK1 KO or WT MEF cells, the exogenous tau protein was less stable in DAPK1 KO than in WT MEF cells (<Figures 5a and b>). However, when we co-transfected tau with vector control or DAPK1 into Pin1 KO MEF cells, exogenous tau protein stability did not increase in DAPK1-transfected cells compared with vector controls (<Figures 5c and d>). In addition, sh-RNA-mediated stable knockdown of Pin1 also abrogated DAPK1-enhanced tau stability in HeLa cells (<Supplementary Figure 4>), indicating that Pin1 has an important role in DAPK1-mediated tau protein regulation. Next, to determine whether DAPK1 inhibits tau turnover by Pin1, we used NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Pin1 and tetracycline-inducible DAPK1, DAPK1K42A or the vector control as shown previously.<34> Tau protein stability and Pin1 Ser71 phosphorylation were significantly increased in cells expressing DAPK1/Pin1, but not DAPK1K42A/Pin1, compared with the vector control/Pin1-expressing cells (<Figures 5e and f>). As Pin1 may promote tau degradation, these results suggest that DAPK1 acts as a central regulator of tau protein stability via Pin1 inhibition. We next examined the effects of DAPK1 on tau protein expression and stability in the brains of age-matched WT and DAPK1 KO mice at different ages. Whereas levels of doublecortin (DCX), an established neurogenesis marker, decreased with age in both mouse models, the expression of DAPK1 was not affected in WT mice (<Figure 6a>). We next evaluated endogenous tau protein expression in these mice. Whereas there was no significant difference in tau expression between 1- and 6-month-old WT and KO mice (<Figure 6b>), it was significantly decreased in 12- and 22-month-old DAPK1 KO mice compared with WT mice of the same age (<Figures 6b and c>). There were no significant differences in mouse tau mRNA levels between WT and DAPK1 KO mice at 12 or 22 months (<Figure 6d>), confirming the results shown in <Figure 2e>. These findings suggest that DAPK1 KO downregulates tau protein expression in an age-dependent manner in the mouse brain.Next, we examined whether DAPK1 affects tau protein stability in brain tissues. In primary cortical neurons, the half-life of endogenous mouse tau was ∼20 h in the presence of DAPK1 but was decreased significantly to <3 h in the absence of DAPK1 (<Figures 6e and f>). Moreover, phosphorylation of Pin1 on Ser71 was also higher in cortical neurons from WT mice than those from DAPK1 KO mice (<Figure 6e>), suggesting that DAPK1-mediated Pin1 phosphorylation is correlated with tau stability. In brain slices from 1-month-old WT and DAPK1 KO mice, the half-life of tau was ∼20 h in the presence of DAPK1 and was decreased dramatically to ∼6 h in the absence of DAPK1 (<Figures 6g and h>). We obtained the same results in brain slices from 6-month-old mice (<Supplementary Figure 5>). Thus, these results showed that DAPK1 enhanced endogenous tau stability in primary cortical neurons as well as brain-slice cultures, an in situ model resembling and retaining many organizational features of living brain tissue. Tau protein is aberrantly phosphorylated, adopts abnormal conformations, and aggregates into fibrils during all tauopathies, including AD.<5>, <6>, <7> As shown in <Figure 7a>, compared with the vector control, DAPK1, but not DAPK1K42A, increased the phosphorylation of exogenous tau protein in HeLa cells, as detected by Thr231-specific (AT180), Ser262-specific, and Ser396-specific (PHF-13) antibodies that recognize specific tau phosphoepitopes and/or abnormal conformations specific to AD NFT. DAPK1 also triggered the phosphorylation of endogenous tau protein in SH-SY5Y cells (<Figure 7b>). Moreover, DAPK1 induced Ser71 phosphorylation of Pin1 compared with cells transfected with the empty vector or DAPK1K42A, suggesting that enhanced expression and phosphorylation of tau in DAPK1-expressing cells was due to phosphorylation of Pin1 (<Figures 7a and b>). Thus, DAPK1 overexpression, but not the kinase-deficient mutant K42A, increased tau phosphorylation in cells.The effect of DAPK1 ablation on phosphorylation of tau and Pin1 in mouse brain tissue was evaluated using immunoblotting with AT180, pSer262-specific, PHF-13, and pSer71-Pin1 antibodies. DAPK1 KO significantly decreased the levels of tau phosphorylation as well as Pin1 phosphorylation in the brains of DAPK1 KO mice at age 12–22 months, but not those at age 6 month, compared with WT littermates (<Figure 7c>). The inhibitory effects of DAPK1 ablation on tau phosphorylation were also observed when we analyzed the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. Total and phosphorylated tau levels were barely detectable in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction at 6 month, but mildly expressed at 12–22 months of age in WT mice (<Figure 7d>)."
PMC4047864_2,"However, levels of total and phosphorylated tau were significantly reduced in DAPK1 KO mice at 12–22 months of age compared with those in WT mice (<Figure 7d>)  Our immunohistochemical staining also confirmed that DAPK1 ablation reduced pThr231-Tau and pSer71-Pin1 levels in mouse brain sections (<Figures 7e and f>). Thus, our results indicate that DAPK1 KO dramatically decreased tau phosphorylation in whole-brain lysates and inhibited tau-related pathological phenotypes such as NFT conformations in sarkosyl-insoluble fraction in an age-dependent manner in the mouse brain model. Tau has an important role in regulating MT dynamics<8>, <9>, <10>, <11> and neuronal differentiation,<45> which are modulated by site-specific phosphorylation.<46> Considering the effects of DAPK1 on Pin1-mediated tau protein stability and phosphorylation, we addressed the biological significance of DAPK1 on tau function by assaying neurite outgrowth and MT assembly. Inhibition of DAPK1 using either novel selective DAPK1 inhibitor (IC50=69 nM) or RNA interference significantly increased NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (<Figures 8a–e>, <Supplementary Figure 6>) and enhanced maturation of primary mouse cortical neurons (<Supplementary Figure 7>). As the primary function of tau is modulation of cytoskeletal MT stability and function,<8>, <9>, <10>, <11> and abnormal tau phosphorylation results in disruption of MT organization,<12>, <13>, <14> we also investigated the effect of DAPK1 on MT organization. DAPK1 inhibitor significantly increased the protein levels of polymerized tubulin showing similar effects induced by MT-stabilizing paclitaxel (<Figures 8f and g>). However, MT-disrupting nocodazole caused inhibition of tubulin polymerization (<Figures 8f and g>). Therefore, our results suggest that DAPK1 inhibits neuronal differentiation and MT polymerization by affecting tau functions. Although there are several current evidence for a role of DAPK1 in neurodegenerative disorders,<29>, <31>, <32>, <33> little has been known about the molecular mechanisms through which DAPK1 exerts this effect. Here, we show that DAPK1 is associated with tau-mediated neuronal degeneration by enhancing tau stability and aberrant phosphorylation, leading to deregulation of its MT binding and polymerization functions. Enhanced protein stability and/or decreased degradation of tau trigger its aggregation, which inhibits neuronal cell survival and induces neurodegeneration.<12>, <13>, <14>, <15>, <16>, <18>, <19> Several proteins have been known to regulate tau protein stability. For example, Pin1 knockdown and/or downregulation in AD neurons increase tau protein stability.<38> As DAPK1 was shown to inhibit Pin1 catalytic activity and function,<34> DAPK1 could affect tau via Pin1 inhibition in neurons.Our greatest interest was in the potential association between late onset AD and DAPK1 expression, as DAPK1 polymorphisms are associated with AD susceptibility.<31>, <32> We measured DAPK1 expression in the hippocampus of AD patients and normal controls, as the hippocampus is damaged early and severely in AD compared with other parts of the cortex and DAPK1 expression is restricted to the hippocampus of the adult brain.<42> We found that hippocampal tissues from aged AD brains had increased levels of DAPK1 protein relative to age-matched normal subjects.We found that the DAPK1 significantly enhanced tau protein expression and stability in cell culture and mouse brain models. Moreover, DAPK1K42A, a kinase-deficient DAPK1 mutant, could not enhance tau protein stability, suggesting that DAPK1 kinase activity is critical for tau protein stability. It was shown that the levels of neurofilament (NF) protein are increased significantly in AD<47>, <48> and that WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is downregulated in the neurons of AD hippocampi.<49> Interestingly, DAPK1 had no effect on the NF light chain (NF-L) but significantly downregulated WWOX protein levels (data not shown), which remains to be further elucidated.Abnormal phosphorylation of tau is considered to be one of the earliest events in neuronal degeneration and appears to precede tau aggregation.<5>, <6>, <7> This abnormal phosphorylation results not only in a toxic loss of function, such as decreased MT binding, but also a toxic gain of function, such as increased tau–tau interaction and pathological aggregation of PHFs.<46> Phosphorylation can also alter the stability and proteotoxicity of tau.<15>, <16>, <18>, <19> In cell cultures, DAPK1, but not the kinase-deficient mutant K42A, increased tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262, and Ser396. These results were confirmed in the mouse brain model, suggesting that DAPK1 KO decreased tau phosphorylation at AD-related sites. Interestingly, the expression of total and phosphorylated tau in DAPK1 KO mouse brain decreased in an age-dependent manner with changes more prominent in 12- to 22-month-old mice. The sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were enriched for abnormal fibrils and phosphorylated tau.<50> Sarkosyl-insoluble tau, which provides a measure for abnormal tau aggregation,<51> was barely detected in 6-month-old WT mouse brains and was found in moderate levels in 12- to 22-month-old mice. Both phosphorylated and total tau levels in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction were significantly reduced in DAPK1 KO mice compared with WT littermates. These results suggest that DAPK1 is involved in the pathological transition from the normal soluble to the filamentous insoluble form of tau.Given that aberrant tau phosphorylation disrupts its MT function<12>, <13>, <14> and DAPK1 affected tau phosphorylation, DAPK1 potentially alters tau-MT interaction. We showed that inhibition of DAPK1 promoted NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, a major indicator of overall nervous system cellular health. Tau drives neurite outgrowth and elongation by promoting the assembly of tubulin into MT,<8>, <9>, <10>, <11> which are critical for the establishment of neuronal cell polarity.<8>, <52> Our results also demonstrated that the inhibition of DAPK1 kinase activity led to an increased assembly of tubulin into MTs, suggesting that DAPK1 suppresses neurite outgrowth and MT assembly via abnormal phosphorylation of tau.Pin1 has a pivotal role in protection against neurodegeneration by restoring the conformation and function of phosphorylated tau or by promoting its dephosphorylation.<36>, <37>, <38>, <40> One of our primary interests was the involvement of Pin1 in DAPK1-mediated tau protein regulation, as it was shown that DAPK1 phosphorylated Ser71 in the catalytic site and inhibited the cellular function of Pin1.<34> DAPK1-mediated increase in tau protein expression and stability were accompanied by increased Pin1 Ser71 phosphorylation. DAPK1 did not increase the stability of the T231A tau mutant, which was also unaffected by Pin1. In a similar fashion, DAPK1 did not affect tau protein stability in Pin1 KO MEF cells. These results are in line with immunohistochemical data showing that the expression of Ser71 phosphorylated Pin1 was significantly lower in DAPK1 KO mouse brain compared with WT mouse brain. Altogether, these data suggest that DAPK1 regulates tau protein via inhibitory phosphorylation of Pin1.Recently, Wu et al<29> reported that MARK1/2 is important in DAPK1-mediated MT assembly and tau toxicity. Ser262 of tau is the most important residue phosphorylated by MARK2 for MT dynamics<53>, <54> and that phosphorylation of this residue is enhanced in AD, which may have a role in tangle formation.<55>, <56> The interaction between MARK2 and tau has also been investigated extensively.<56> We demonstrated that the protein expression and stability of the S262A tau mutant, which inhibits the interaction between MARK2 and tau, were significantly increased by DAPK1, similar to that of WT tau, suggesting that DAPK1-enhanced tau protein stability is independent of MARK proteins.As tau accumulation is a critical event in tauopathy, our demonstration of the critical role of DAPK1 in tau accumulation substantiates the need for further studies on its effects on tauopathy."
PMC4047864_3,"Such an effort would benefit from the generation of transgenic (Tg) mice with inducible and brain-restricted DAPK1 expression or of DAPK1 KO/ Tg mice crossed with tauopathy mouse models  Because AD is an irreversible and progressive brain disease, slowing its progression is currently the best option, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for improving treatment outcome. Even though we detected increased DAPK1 expression in the brains of AD patients, it has not yet been determined whether it is a reliable biological diagnostic marker for the incipient stages of AD. Standard laboratory testing, such as blood tests, combined with the newly developed and state-of-the-art brain molecular imaging techniques used to detect brain pathological biomarkers will facilitate investigation of this possibility.Taken together, our findings suggest that DAPK1 enhances tau protein stability and that DAPK1 KO might abolish abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of tau. We also found that DAPK1 triggered Pin1 Ser71 phosphorylation in a neuronal model, and DAPK1-mediated regulation of tau protein was prevented in the absence of Pin1, suggesting a critical role for Pin1. The functional studies showed that DAPK1 is involved in the impairment of normal cellular tau function, including MT assembly. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that DAPK1 expression is increased in AD brains and may be a marker of AD pathology. Overall, our data suggest a model in which DAPK1 inhibits tau function via aberrant tau phosphorylation/accumulation followed by impaired tau-MT interactions and promote pathological tau aggregation through inhibitory phosphorylation of Pin1 (<Supplementary Figure 8>). Moreover, our studies suggest that DAPK1 represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for human AD and other tauopathies. Cycloheximide (CHX), N-lauroylsarcosine Sodium Salt, nerve growth factor (NGF), paclitaxel, nocodazole, and paraformaldehyde (PFA) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). DAPK1 inhibitor (4Z)-4-(3-Pyridylmethylene)-2-styryl-oxazol-5-one was obtained from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA, USA). CHX was used to inhibit protein synthesis and assess tau protein stability. The alkyl anionic detergent N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt was used to obtain sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. NGF was used to stimulate neurite outgrowth. Paclitaxel was used to stabilize MT, and Nocodazole was used to disrupt MT. (4Z)-4-(3-Pyridylmethylene)-2-styryl-oxazol-5-one was used to specifically inhibit DAPK1 kinase activity. The human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa; the human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH; the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3; and the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MEF cells were obtained from the WT, DAPK1 KO, and Pin1 KO embryos between embryonic day 12.5 and 14.5. HeLa, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH, NIH3T3, and MEF cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM high-glucose supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco). The cultures were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cDNA fragment encoding the human DAPK1 or DAPK1K42A mutant (in which lysine 42 was replaced by alanine) or DAPK1ΔCaM mutant (in which a Ca2+/Calmodulin regulatory domain is deleted) was cloned into 5′-end-Flag tagged and CMV promoter-driven mammalian expression vector pRK5. The full-length cDNA of human WT tau or T231A (in which threonine 231 was replaced by alanine) tau or S262A (in which serine 262 was replaced by alanine) tau was cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were transiently transfected with different plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (for HeLa, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH, and NIH3T3) or Lipofectamine LTX&Plus (for MEF and PC12) transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For generating stable DAPK1 knockdown SH-SY5Y cells, two DAPK1 sh-RNA clones, which are constructed within lentiviral pLKO.1-Puro vector were transfected together with VSV-G- and gag-pol-expressing plasmids into 293T cells. Sixty hours after transfection, virus-containing supernatants were used to infect the SH-SY5Y cells. A day after infection, the stable clones were selected using 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. The target sequences of DAPK1-specific sh-RNAs were as follows: sh-RNA-#1, 5′-CAAGAAACGTTAGCAAATG-3′ sh-RNA-#2, 5′-GGTCAAGGATCCAAAGAAG-3′.All si-RNAs were designed by Rosetta using a proprietary algorithm and were synthesized by Sigma. SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with two different si-RNAs against human DAPK1 or scrambled si-RNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h of transfection, cells were harvested. For the neurite outgrowth assay, PC12 cells were also transiently transfected with a si-RNA against rat DAPK1 or scrambled si-RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 36 h. The si-RNA target sequences were as follows: human DAPK1-#1, 5′-GAGAATCGATGTCCAGGAT-3′ human DAPK1-#2, 5′-GACATGAAGGTACTTCGAA-3′ rat DAPK1, 5′-CCAACAACGGGATCCTAGA-3′ and scrambled si-RNA, 5′-GATCATACGTGCGATCAGA-3′. A scrambled si-RNA has no identity to any known gene sequence from human, mouse, or rat in the BLAST database. Total RNA was isolated from SH-SY5Y cells or tissues of human and mouse brain using an RNeasy Mini Kit or RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). To determine mRNA levels of tau and DAPK1, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA) using a total volume of 20 μl containing 200 nM primers and 1 × AbsoluteTM Blue QPCR SYBR Green Mix (ABgene, Waltham, MA, USA). For human tau amplification, primers htau-F (5′-TGACACGGACGCTGGCCTGAA-3′) and htau-R (5′-CACTTGGAGGTCACCTTGCTC-3′) were used. For human DAPK1 amplification, primers hDAPK1-F (5′-TCAAGACAGGCACGGCAAT-3′) and hDAPK1-R (5′-CCACCACGATAGGCATGTTG-3′) were used. For human 36B4 amplification, primers h36B4-F (5′-AGATGCAGCAGATCCGCAT-3′) and h36B4-R (5′-GTTCTTGCCCATCAGCACC-3′) were used. For human 18S rRNA amplification, primers h18S rRNA-F (5′-TGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCCATGCA-3′) and h18S rRNA-R (GCGACCAAAGGAACCATAACTG-3′) were used. For mouse tau amplification, primers mtau-F (5′-TTCTGTCCTCGCCTTCTGTC-3′) and mtau-R (5′-CTCCAGCATGGTCTTCCATT-3′) were used. For mouse 36B4 amplification, primers m36B4-F (5′-TTTGCTGTACTGACTCGGTGA-3′) and m36B4-R (5′-CCTCCCACAACAAAACAACC-3′) were used. Tau protein half-life studies were performed by incubating cells or tissues with CHX (10–75 μg/ml) for the indicated time. The exogenous tau protein stability was determined using HeLa, NIH3T3 carrying doxycycline-inducible expression of pTRE-Tight or pTRE-Tight-DAPK1, NIH3T3 carrying stably expressing Pin1 in combination with doxycycline-inducible expression of either pTRE-Tight or pTRE-Tight-DAPK1 or pTRE-Tight-DAPK1K42A, WT MEF, DAPK1 KO MEF, and Pin1 KO MEF cells. The endogenous tau protein stability was determined using SK-N-SH cells and primary cortical neurons and brain slices prepared from WT and DAPK1 KO mice. The results from CHX experiments were quantified by densitometry and analyzed using the ImageQuant software. DAPK1 KO mice were described previously.<57> Primary cultures of mouse embryonic cortical neurons were prepared as described previously.<58>, <59> Briefly, dissociated embryonic neurons from embryonic day 16 (E16) WT and/or DAPK1 KO C57BL/6 pregnant mice were resuspended in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5% horse serum, 100 μM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 28 mM D-glucose."
PMC4047864_4,"Cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated 6-well plates and maintained in a serum-free medium system consisting of neurobasal media supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) to inhibit glial proliferation  Cortical neuronal cells were used for assaying endogenous tau protein stability (at 1 week) and neurite outgrowth (at 3 days). Organotypic mouse brain-slice cultures were performed as described previously<38> with minor modifications. Briefly, brains from 1- or 6-month-old mice were removed and cut into coronal slices of 260-μm thickness with vibratome (Leica VT1200, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Slices containing the hippocampus were used for endogenous tau protein stability. The slices were cultured onto organotypic Millicell cell culture inserts (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in 6-well culture plates with culture medium. A sarkosyl-insoluble fraction was prepared from mouse brain tissue as described previously<38> with minor modification. The brain tissue was homogenized in 5 × volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.8 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10% sucrose, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and centrifuged at 20 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and mixed to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with constant shaking. After ultra-centrifugation at 100 000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the pellet containing sarkosyl-insoluble, aggregated tau was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for quantification of phosphorylated tau protein. For immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain tissues, WT and DAPK1 KO mice were anesthetized and intracardially perfused with 4% PFA. Immersion-fixed tissue sections were embedded in paraffin. Coronal tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated with descending grade of ethanol, and incubated with 3% H2O2/PBS to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. After antigen retrieval, sections were incubated in PBS blocking buffer with 5% horse serum, 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% v/v Tween20. Primary antibodies were added in blocking buffer and incubated with sections overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody was biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG. Sections were processed with ABC reagents by using a Vector ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). After washing, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reaction was detected with diaminobenzidine and H2O2. Positively stained areas were quantified with ImageJ software. To induce differentiation, PC12 cells plated onto poly-L-lysine (Sigma)-coated 6-well in serum starved conditions (0.5% horse serum and 0.25% FBS) were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF. Once cells developed neurites after induction of differentiation, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. The level of neurite outgrowth was quantified by counting the number of PC12 cells bearing at least one neurite with a length equal to the cell body diameter and by measuring the neurite length in random images from triplicate experiments. Neurites were categorized by their length relative to the cell body diameter as previously described.<60> ‘L0' means cells with no neurite, ‘L1' means cells with neurites whose length is shorter than the cell body diameter, ‘L2' means cells with neurites whose length is between the original and twice the cell body diameter, and ‘L3' means cells with neurites whose length is longer than twice the cell body diameter. PC12 cells were exposed to paclitaxel (0.2 μM), nocodazole (2 μM), and DAPK1 inhibitor (70-, 100 nM) for 12 h. After treatment, cells were harvested and lysed at 37 °C for 5 min with hypotonic buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 18 000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C. The supernatants containing the unpolymerized (soluble) tubulin were transferred to a fresh tube. The pellets containing the polymerized (insoluble) tubulin were resuspended in an equal amount of hypotonic buffer and sonicated on ice for 2 min. Protein samples (10 μg) of the two fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. The tubulin signals were quantified by densitometry and analyzed using the ImageQuant software. After harvesting, the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Mouse and human brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing tissue in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.8 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10% sucrose, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The soluble protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (5–10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The membranes were then probed with various antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody-bound proteins were detected using the Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer) or ECL Prime (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) chemiluminescence system. The following antibodies were used to probe different proteins: Flag, DAPK1 (Sigma); DCX, β-actin, α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); PHF-13 (p-Ser396-Tau) (Anaspec, Fremont, CA, USA); Tau-5, p-Tau (Ser262); and AT180 (pThr231-Tau) (Invitrogen). Whole-brain tissues from mice at different ages (1–22 month) were harvested for the comparison between WT and DAPK1 KO littermates. After extraction, whole brains were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-cold isopentane and stored at −80 °C until use. Total brain lysates and sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were obtained from these mouse brain tissues. Brain hippocampus tissues of human Alzheimer's patients and controls were obtained from the Neuropathology Core of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Boston, MA, USA) and the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (Boston, MA, USA). Research was conducted in compliance with the policies and principles contained in the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human subjects. In most cases, brain hippocampus tissues obtained within 30 h postmortem were used; 12 from individuals with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and 12 from individual without any neurological disorder (<Supplementary Table S1>). The data are presented as means±standard error (S.E.) of the three independent experiments. Statistical significances were calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison post hoc test using SAS 8.1 software for Windows (SAS Institute), with P-values <0.05 considered to be statistically significant.

Statistical differences between the level of soluble and polymerized tubulin in each treatment were also determined The presence of tangles composed of phosphorylated tau is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau, a microtubule (MT)-associated protein, accumulates in AD potentially as a result of posttranslational modifications, such as hyperphosphorylation and conformational changes. However, it has not been fully understood how tau accumulation and phosphorylation are deregulated. In the present study, we identified a novel role of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in the regulation of the tau protein. We found that hippocampal DAPK1 expression is markedly increased in the brains of AD patients compared with age-matched normal subjects. DAPK1 overexpression increased tau protein stability and phosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites. In contrast, inhibition of DAPK1 by overexpression of a DAPK1 kinase-deficient mutant or by genetic knockout significantly decreased tau protein stability and abolished its phosphorylation in cell cultures and in mice. Mechanistically, DAPK1-enhanced tau protein stability was mediated by Ser71 phosphorylation of Pin1, a prolyl isomerase known to regulate tau protein stability, phosphorylation, and tau-related pathologies. In addition, inhibition of DAPK1 kinase activity significantly increased the assembly of MTs and accelerated nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth. Given that DAPK1 has been genetically linked to late onset AD, these results suggest that DAPK1 is a novel regulator of tau protein abundance, and that DAPK1 upregulation might contribute to tau-related pathologies in AD. Therefore, we offer that DAPK1 might be a novel therapeutic target for treating human AD and other tau-related pathologies. ."
PMC4778021_0,"Dysfunction and accumulation of the microtubule-associated human Tau (hTau) protein into intraneuronal aggregates is observed in many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Reversible lysine acetylation has recently emerged as a post-translational modification that may play an important role in the modulation of hTau pathology. Acetylated hTau species have been observed within hTau aggregates in human AD brains and multi-acetylation of hTau in vitro regulates its propensity to aggregate. However, whether lysine acetylation at position 280 (K280) modulates hTau-induced toxicity in vivo is unknown. We generated new Drosophila transgenic models of hTau pathology to evaluate the contribution of K280 acetylation to hTau toxicity, by analysing the respective toxicity of pseudo-acetylated (K280Q) and pseudo-de-acetylated (K280R) mutant forms of hTau. We observed that mis-expression of pseudo-acetylated K280Q-hTau in the adult fly nervous system potently exacerbated fly locomotion defects and photoreceptor neurodegeneration. In addition, modulation of K280 influenced total hTau levels and phosphorylation without changing hTau solubility. Altogether, our results indicate that pseudo-acetylation of the single K280 residue is sufficient to exacerbate hTau neurotoxicity in vivo, suggesting that acetylated K280-hTau species contribute to the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD.

M. K. G. received support from the Cologne Graduate School of Ageing Research. Human Tau (hTau) is a natively unfolded, microtubule-associated protein that regulates the assembly and stabilisation of microtubules in neurons. Tau dysfunction is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prominent Tauopathy, which is characterised by both hyperphosphorylated Tau and β-amyloid deposits. However, the mechanisms leading to Tau dysfunction in AD are still not fully understood.Tau protein is highly post-translationally modified. Given its unstructured nature, it is likely that distinct combinations of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation, act in concert, resulting in structural and functional changes that may influence Tau toxicity and function (for review see<1>). Interestingly, next to hTau hyperphosphorylation, reversible lysine acetylation has recently emerged as a modification that may play an important role in the modulation of AD pathology<2><3><4><5>. Indeed, in vitro experiments have revealed that the recombinant full-length (FL) hTau protein displays more than 20 putative acetylation sites<2><3><6>. Interestingly, enhancing FL hTau lysine acetylation through co-incubation with Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors influenced hTau phosphorylation<4>, while co-incubation with either CREB-binding protein (CBP) or p300 acetyltransferase enzymes and acetyl-CoA could regulate hTau aggregation<2><4><6>. In addition, multi-acetylated FL hTau was shown to display a reduced ability to promote tubulin assembly into microtubules in vitro<2>.Immunohistochemical analyses of human AD brains have so far revealed the presence of three acetylated forms of hTau within Tau deposits, namely acetylated-K174-hTau, acetylated-K274-hTau and acetylated-K280-hTau, suggesting a high biological relevance of these modified epitopes in AD pathogenesis<2><5><7><8>. In a recent study, pseudo-acetylation at K174 (K174Q) was reported to result in hTau accumulation and was sufficient to induce cognitive deficits in vivo reference 5. However, whether acetylation events at other hTau lysine residues also modulate toxicity in vivo is currently unknown. Lysine 280 is of particular interest because its deletion results in hTau aggregation<9><10>, indicating a key role of K280 in hTau pathogenicity. Interestingly, in addition to being present in AD brains, acetylated-K280-hTau species were also detected in insoluble fractions from brain lysates of both PS19 and PS19/PDAPP transgenic mouse models of AD and accumulated with age in the cortex of PS19/PDAPP mice, further implying a role for K280 acetylation in hTau aggregation<2>. In addition, the generation of a pseudo-acetylated hTau-K280 mutant using a glutamine substitution has revealed that this residue is important for microtubule bundling in cell culture experiments<2>. Altogether, these experiments suggest a potential role for hTau-K280 in AD pathogenesis. However, whether acetylation of hTau at K280 directly triggers toxicity in vivo remains elusive.The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a powerful model system for the in vivo analysis of neurodegenerative diseases<11><12><13><14>. We therefore generated inducible, transgenic fly lines over-expressing the wild-type full length human Tau protein (the 2N4R isoform consisting of 441 amino acids) as well as mutant forms of the latter either mimicking acetylation at lysine 280 with glutamine (K280Q), to model both the charge and chemical structure of acetylated lysine, or abolishing acetylation at this residue while conserving its positive charge, with arginine (K280R)<2><3><15><16><17><18>. We used on one hand a site-directed integration strategy to ensure comparable expression levels among hTau mutants<19> so as to unravel in an unbiased way the effect of the single hTau-K280 mutations in vivo, and on the other hand an inducible driver system to circumvent any developmental effects potentially related to hTau expression.Mis-expression of these hTau species in the adult fly nervous system using the pan-neuronal elav-GeneSwitch-Gal4 (elavGS) inducible driver showed that pseudo-acetylated hTau-K280Q significantly increased neurodegeneration and fly locomotion defects. This effect was associated with significant changes in hTau levels and phosphorylation on S262 and T212/S214, but without any overt alteration in hTau solubility. In addition, hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R species led to a similar reduction of fly lifespan. Altogether, our results suggest that the modulation of the single K280 hTau residue is sufficient to regulate hTau neurotoxicity in vivo. To investigate the potential toxicity of adult-restricted neuronal expression of the full-length (2N4R) human Tau protein (hTau-wt) in Drosophila, we used the attP/attB targeted integration system together with the UAS-Gal4 binary system to generate a transgenic fly line enabling the standardised and tissue-specific expression of hTau-wt proteins. Adult-onset expression of hTau-wt was achieved by feeding adult flies with the RU486 inducer (<Supplementary Figure 1>). Interestingly, we observed a drastic alteration of fly survival following homozygous hTau-wt expression in adult neurons using the pan-neuronal elavGS driver (****p < 0.0001 vs. non-induced hTau-wt controls, log-rank test, <Fig. 1a>), with median lifespans reaching 21.9 and 43.3 days for induced and non-induced hTau-wt transgenic lines, respectively. The toxicity of hTau-wt proteins depended on both transgene copy number (<Supplementary Figure 2a>) and experimental temperature (<Supplementary Figure 2b>). The survival of the elavGS driver line control was not affected by RU486 feeding (p > 0.05, <Fig. 1a>). In line with hTau-wt toxicity on fly survival, we observed striking detrimental effects of hTau-wt expression on fly climbing ability (****p < 0.0001 vs. non-induced controls at day 10 and day 15, two-way ANOVA, <Fig. 1b>), while the climbing behaviour of elavGS control flies was unchanged upon RU486 feeding (p > 0.05 at all investigated ages, two-way ANOVA, <Fig. 1b>). We then investigated whether hTau-wt neuronal expression led to neurodegeneration by analysing the loss of photoreceptor neurons in the Drosophila compound eye using the quantitative cornea neutralization technique as previously described<12><20>."
PMC4778021_1,"Adult-onset neuronal expression of hTau-wt led to the progressive loss of rhabdomeres in Drosophila eyes, with the percentage of affected ommatidia reaching 13 8% ± 4.59% following 27 days of transgene expression (**p < 0.01 along age, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 1c>), while the elavGS driver line showed no significant photoreceptor neurodegeneration over time (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 1c>). Altogether, these results indicate significant toxic effects triggered by the adult-onset neuronal expression of hTau-wt in Drosophila.Next, we investigated the influence of hTau acetylation at lysine 280 (K280) on hTau-induced toxicity. Therefore, we generated new transgenic Drosophila lines expressing either pseudo-acetylated (K280Q) or pseudo-de-acetylated (K280R) mimic forms of the full-length hTau-wt protein using site-directed mutagenesis. Comparable hTau expression among the transgenic lines was ensured by the use of the attP/attB site-specific integration strategy and verified by qRT-PCR, both shortly after the beginning of transgene expression (p > 0.05, 1 day of RU486 induction, Student’s t-test, <Fig. 2a>) and following a longer induction period (p > 0.05, 5 days of RU486 induction, Student’s t-test, <Fig. 2b>).Then, to evaluate the effect of K280 pseudo-acetylation/de-acetylation on hTau neurotoxicity, we analysed photoreceptor neurodegeneration in the compound eyes of hTau-wt, hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R transgenic flies. Interestingly, adult-onset neuronal expression of pseudo-acetylated hTau-K280Q species led to a significantly increased photoreceptor neurodegeneration as compared to both hTau-wt and hTau-K280R transgenics, and was detectable as early as following 9 days of transgene expression (*p < 0.05, day 9, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 3>). Rhabdomere loss progressively increased with age and affected up to 31.5% ± 9.31% of all ommatidia following 27 days of transgene expression in the hTau-K280Q transgenic line. On the other hand, photoreceptor neurodegeneration measured in hTau-K280R flies compound eyes followed a similar pattern as in hTau-wt transgenics (p > 0.05 at all investigated time points, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 3>), while being overall milder than neurodegeneration observed in hTau-K280Q flies (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 3>). Altogether, these results point to the exacerbated neurotoxicity of hTau species that are acetylated at K280 in the adult fly nervous system.We subsequently investigated whether the differential degree of toxicity induced by these hTau species would be concomitant to an effect on hTau phosphorylation at specific sites (<Fig. 4a>). Interestingly, we observed that pseudo-acetylation or pseudo-de-acetylation of the single hTau-K280 residue resulted in a significant alteration of hTau phosphorylation as measured in heads extracts from 14-day-old flies. hTau-K280Q mutants showed significantly increased phosphorylation on S262 as compared to both hTau-wt and hTau-K280R flies, when normalised to total hTau (K9JA) levels (**p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 4b,c>). Conversely, phosphorylation on the AT100 epitope (pT212/S214) was increased in heads of hTau-K280R flies as compared to hTau-K280Q (**p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 4b,c>) and hTau-wt (*p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 4b,c>) transgenics. Regarding phosphorylation on the AT8 epitope (pS202/T205), we did not find any difference among our transgenic lines when normalised to total hTau levels (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 4b,c>). These effects of K280 mutation on hTau phosphorylation were also verified in older flies (<Supplementary Figure 3>).Noteworthy, it appeared that total hTau protein amounts were also regulated by the K280 mutation. Total hTau levels were significantly decreased in the hTau-K280R line using the polyclonal K9JA antibody (*p < 0.05 vs. hTau-wt, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 4b,c>) as well as the monoclonal HT7 antibody (*p < 0.05, hTau-K280R vs. hTau-wt and hTau-K280R vs. hTau-K280Q, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 4b,c>). Such an effect on total hTau protein levels, occurring despite comparable hTau mRNA levels in all three lines (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 2>), could have been the consequence of a change in hTau solubility. We therefore investigated hTau solubility by means of fractionation using RAB and RIPA-1% SDS buffers in heads of 14-day-old hTau-expressing flies. The vast majority of the hTau pool was retrieved in the RAB-soluble fraction, with a very low proportion of all hTau species being in an insoluble state in hTau transgenic Drosophila (<Supplementary Figure 4>). Notably, we could not observe any overt change in hTau solubility among the transgenic lines using the K9JA anti-hTau antibody (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 5a,b>). Therefore, we used the T22 antibody<21> to evaluate the formation of soluble hTau oligomers, but we could not find any specific signal in hTau-expressing lines compared to non-transgenic flies (<Supplementary Figure 5>). These results together suggest that the decreased hTau protein levels observed in the hTau-K280R line (<Fig. 4>) were likely not due to reduced hTau aggregation. We therefore hypothesized that, alternatively, the degradation of hTau proteins could be differentially regulated in our hTau mutants. We tackled this question by performing a “switch-on/switch-off” experiment, in which flies were exposed to the RU486 inducer for 2 days (“2d ON”) to induce neuronal hTau expression, and then transferred to RU486-free food for either 2 or 5 days (“2d ON + 2d OFF” and “2d ON + 5d OFF”, respectively) to evaluate hTau clearance (<Fig. 6>). We could observe that, while hTau levels were significantly decreased after 2 days of clearance in both hTau-wt and hTau-K280R transgenic flies (*p < 0.05, “2d ON + 2d OFF” vs. “2d ON”, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 6a,b>), we did not highlight any significant clearance of hTau-K280Q proteins at this time point (p > 0.05, “2d ON + 2d OFF” vs. “2d ON”, one-way ANOVA, <Fig. 6a,b>). Interestingly, hTau levels from all hTau mutants were significantly decreased after 5 days of clearance (<Fig. 6a,b>), suggesting that clearance of hTau-K280Q species was delayed compared to that of hTau-wt and hTau-K280R, rather than completely halted. We therefore investigated whether the levels of Hsc70 and HSP90, two chaperone proteins involved in protein degradation, were regulated in our hTau transgenic flies. We did not observe any significant difference in their levels in head extracts from 21-day-old hTau-wt, hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R transgenics (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, <supplementary Figure 6>).Finally, we evaluated the impact of hTau-K280 acetylation on fly climbing ability (<Fig. 7> and <supplementary figure 7>) and survival (<Fig. 8>). In line with the neurotoxic effects observed following hTau-K280Q expression in adult fly neurons (<Fig. 3>), we observed that mimicking the de-acetylated state of lysine 280 in the hTau protein mitigated the toxic effects of hTau expression on climbing ability in older flies (day 13: *p < 0.05, induced hTau-K280R vs. induced hTau-K280Q and ****p < 0.0001, induced hTau-K280R vs. induced hTau-wt; two-way ANOVA, <Fig. 7>). Though this effect was relatively mild, it was significant and highly reproducible as shown in <supplementary figure 7> (day 15: ****p < 0.0001, induced hTau-K280R vs. induced hTau-K280Q and vs. induced hTau-wt; two-way ANOVA).In terms of fly survival, surprisingly, we observed on one hand that both pseudo-acetylation and pseudo-de-acetylation at K280 on hTau reduced fly lifespan to a similar extent (p > 0.05, induced hTau-K280Q vs. induced hTau-K280R, log-rank test, <Fig. 8>) and on the other hand that both Q and R mutations significantly delayed fly death as compared to the non-mutated hTau-wt (****p < 0.0001, induced hTau-wt vs. induced hTau-K280Q and vs. induced hTau-K280R, log-rank test, <Fig. 8>).Altogether, our results indicate that the acetylation status at K280 regulated hTau phosphorylation and protein levels, while the adult-onset neuronal expression of K280Q pseudo-acetylated hTau species led to exacerbated neurotoxicity and fly locomotion defects, an effect that was however not translated into decreased fly survival."
PMC4778021_2,"Post-translationally modified hTau proteins are the main constituents of intraneuronal aggregates observed in AD brains  While hTau hyperphosphorylation has extensively been shown to contribute to hTau toxicity (for review see<22>), recent reports implicate acetylated hTau species in the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD<2><3><5><7><8>. However, to date, no clear link has been established between acetylated hTau at K280 and toxicity in vivo. Using inducible transgenic Drosophila lines expressing either acetylation- or anti-acetylation- mimics at residue 280 of the full-length hTau protein, we demonstrated in the present study that hTau-K280Q neuronal expression is detrimental in adult Drosophila, exacerbating photoreceptor neuronal degeneration and locomotion defects while modulating hTau levels and phosphorylation.Transgenic fly lines were generated using the attP/attB targeted integration system, which was previously shown to induce expression of transgenes at comparable levels among the investigated lines (<12><19> and <Fig. 2>). Combining these transgenes with the inducible GeneSwitch system allowed us to bypass potential developmental effects of hTau ectopic expression (for review see<23>) and therefore analyse toxic effects exclusively related to hTau expression in the adult nervous system. Under these conditions, we could observe that the adult-onset expression of the wild-type 2N4R isoform of human Tau in the Drosophila nervous system was highly detrimental, leading to strikingly impaired fly climbing ability and survival, and triggering photoreceptor neurodegeneration. While previous studies have reported reduced fly lifespan upon constitutively over-expressed wild-type hTau<13><24>, we highlight in the present study drastic toxic effects that are specifically attributable to the adult-onset expression of the longest CNS hTau isoform in the fly nervous system.To investigate the toxicity induced by K280-hTau acetylation in particular, we used acetylation- and anti-acetylation-mimic mutations<2><5><15><16><17><18>. Rather than making use of lysine acetyltransferase enzymes such as CBP or p300 to increase overall acetylation of hTau, our site-specific approach allowed us to analyse the specific effects of a single pseudo-acetylated hTau residue in vivo. Noteworthy, mimicking lysine acetylation with glutamine or de-acetylation with arginine, respectively, is particularly suitable to investigate the effect of a modified charge.In this study, we chose to analyse the effects of K280 acetylation on hTau toxicity. Indeed, hTau K280 residue, and more specifically its deletion, was shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Tauopathies, both in patients and in transgenic models<10><25><26><27><28>. Importantly, acetylated-K280-hTau species have been observed within hTau deposits in AD brains<2><7><8> and were retrieved in insoluble proteins fractions from brains of AD transgenic mice<2>, altogether supporting a potential role for acetylated-K280-hTau in AD pathogenesis.Previous in vitro reports have shown a regulation of hTau aggregation following multi-acetylation by acetyltransferase enzymes, pointing to either increased<2> or decreased<4><6> aggregation of hTau. Interestingly, even though we observed lower levels of total hTau proteins in the fly nervous system upon pseudo-de-acetylation of the single K280-hTau residue, we could not highlight any significant change in hTau solubility among the investigated hTau transgenic lines. Our results therefore suggest that modifying the single K280-hTau epitope using acetylation mimics is not sufficient to change hTau aggregation in a way that is detectable in vivo. Interestingly, this further implies that acetylation and deletion of K280 follow different pathways to eventually trigger neurotoxicity, as K280 deletion was previously shown to promote hTau aggregation into paired helical filaments<9>. As our system ensured comparable expression levels of transgenes (<Fig. 2>), the differential hTau protein levels we observed might rather be the consequence of either increased hTau oligomerisation<5><21> or differential protein degradation, involving either the ubiquitin-proteasome system and/or lysosome-mediated autophagy. Indeed, a recent study investigating the consequences of K174 acetylation on hTau-induced toxicity, has suggested that the acetyl-mimic K174Q mutation both increased the rate of hTau oligomerisation together with increasing hTau stability in cell culture<5>. Importantly, we could not detect any specific signal for hTau oligomers in our hTau transgenic lines compared to non-induced controls, suggesting that further experiments will be necessary to determine whether hTau oligomers can be detected in transgenic Drosophila. Yet, interestingly, it appeared that hTau clearance was differentially regulated in our hTau transgenic flies. Indeed, by means of a switch on/switch off experiment, we observed that the clearance of hTau proteins in hTau-K280Q flies was significantly delayed compared to that of hTau-wt and hTau-K280R transgenics. These results suggest that the higher induced neurotoxicity and increased protein stability of hTau-K280Q species might be a consequence of their impaired clearance. Though we could not highlight any regulation in the levels of the Hsc70 and HSP90 chaperone proteins, further investigations will be needed to determine how the cell degradation machinery is involved in the regulation of the observed differential hTau clearance.Next, our results support previous findings suggesting a crosstalk between hTau acetylation and phosphorylation<4> and give important insights suggesting that hTau post-translational modifications may act in concert in vivo. Indeed, we observed higher phosphorylation on Serine 262 and lower phosphorylation on Threonine 212/Serine 214 (AT100), whereas no change was measured for Serine202/Threonine 205 phosphorylation (AT8), in K280Q-hTau mutants as compared to K280R-hTau transgenics, when normalised to total hTau levels. This effect was observed in both 14-day-old and 21-day-old flies. Noteworthy, our results indicated that AT100 phosphorylation levels changed in our hTau transgenic flies without any overt modulation of hTau solubility. This observation is in line with a previous study reporting hTau phosphorylation on the AT100 epitope independently from hTau aggregation<29>.Regarding hTau-wt species, it is interesting to note that its phosphorylation on S262 and T212/S214 is strictly following neither that of K280Q- nor of K280R-mutated forms of hTau, but rather is a mixture of both. Importantly, this effect is likely to be the specific consequence of the post-translationally editable lysine 280 present in hTau-wt species. Human Tau phosphorylation is a tightly regulated process that underlies both physiological and pathological functions<30><31>. It is possible that the acetylation state of K280 regulates hTau conformation, thereby changing the accessibility of some hTau epitopes to kinases and phosphatases, or that it triggers differential signalling pathways leading to different sub-cellular localisations of these hTau species, with a differential enzymatic environment. Altogether, our results suggest that the single K280Q acetylation-mimic mutation is sufficient to induce a significant change in hTau protein phosphorylation, potentially contributing to hTau-induced neurotoxicity.Finally, our results indicate that despite an exacerbated toxicity of K280Q-hTau on neuronal degeneration and fly climbing ability, expression of these hTau species did not reduce fly survival as compared to hTau-K280R transgenics. Indeed, unexpectedly, we observed that acetylation-mimic and de-acetylation-mimic mutations of K280-hTau triggered comparable toxic effects on fly survival. This points to an uncoupling of the extent of toxicity that is observed on neuronal degeneration, behaviour and fly lifespan. It could be speculated that the involved neuronal subtypes differ in their susceptibility to hTau-induced toxicity, or that fly survival is also regulated by additional factors than the sole neuronal fitness."
PMC4778021_3,"Indeed, next to neurons, other cell types might be important and involved in the regulation of fly lifespan, as was suggested by a previous report investigating the toxicity of hTau proteins on fly survival when specifically expressed in Drosophila glial cells<32>  In the context of the growing evidence that hTau proteins can be secreted by neurons<33><34><35>, one could speculate that the surrounding glial cells differentially respond to different secreted hTau species, altogether differentially regulating fly lifespan.Importantly, the alteration of fly survival induced by both K280Q- and K280R-hTau was significantly milder than that induced by the non-mutated hTau-wt species. While further experiments would be required to decipher this issue, one can hypothesize that in hTau-wt transgenic flies, the free lysine residue at position 280 undergoes various conditions that may result in potent toxicity on fly survival. First, in contrast to the K280Q and K280R mutants, hTau-wt flies most likely express two pools of hTau species with regards to K280 acetylation, the stoichiometry of which can be hardly controlled in our system. In addition, the relative abundance of acetylated K280-hTau species may be regulated with age in the Drosophila nervous system. Finally, the occurrence of other post-translational modifications at K280 such as methylation or ubiquitination cannot be ruled out in our hTau-wt transgenic line, and this may as well regulate hTau-wt toxicity.In summary, our results indicate that modulating hTau acetylation at lysine 280 is sufficient to influence hTau neurotoxicity in vivo, which, in the context of the massive neuronal loss observed in AD brains, suggests that acetylated K280-hTau species likely contribute to the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD and represent a relevant target for treatment. All fly stocks were kept at 25 °C or 29 °C on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle at constant humidity and fed with standard sugar/yeast/agar (SYA) medium (15 g L−1 agar, 50 g L−1 sugar, 100 g L−1 yeast, 30 mL L−1 nipagin and 3 mL L−1 propionic acid). All lines were backcrossed into a white Dahomey (wDah) wild-type, outbred genetic background for at least six generations prior to experiments. The inducible and neuron-specific gene-switch Elav-Gal4 driver line (elavGS) was derived from the original elavGS 301.2 line<36> and obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Hervé Tricoire (CNRS, France). Adult-onset transgene expression using the elavGS driver was achieved through addition of the activator RU486 (Mifepristone) to fly food at a final concentration of 200 μM. Non-induced controls were obtained by adding the vehicle (i.e. ethanol) to fly food. All elavGS-driven experimental flies were kept at 25 °C throughout development and during the 48-h mating step following eclosion, after which females were sorted and transferred to 29 °C, apart from the lifespan experiment shown in <supplementary figure 2b>, which was performed at 25 °C. cDNA from the 2N4R human Tau isoform (441 amino acids, the largest isoform in human central nervous system) was obtained from Gustke et al.<37>. Specific mutation of lysine 280 of hTau was achieved using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies). hTau constructs were subsequently cloned into the pUASTattB vector, enabling the use of the attP/attB targeted integration system combined with the φC31 integrase to generate transgenic fly lines. Transgenes were inserted into the attP40 landing-site locus to ensure both standard levels of mRNA expression and the best ratio of induced to basal expression<19>. The correctness of hTau sequences was verified in transgenic fly lines by genomic DNA sequencing. All experimental lines were homozygous for the hTau transgene except for <supplementary figure 2> where they were heterozygous. For lifespan experiments, 150 to 200 once-mated females per group were allocated to vials at a density of 10 flies per vial and subsequently kept at 29 °C or 25 °C. Every 2 to 3 days, flies were transferred to fresh food and the number of dead flies was recorded. Results are expressed as the proportion of survivors ±95% confidence interval. Fly climbing ability was measured and analysed as previously described<12><38> using a countercurrent apparatus. At least 3 replicates of 20 female flies per group were analysed blindly in 3 independent experiments. We used the cornea neutralization technique<20> to visualize the rhabdomeres from the ommatidia of the fly compound eye. Briefly, dissected fly heads were mounted on microscope slides using nail polish and further covered with oil. The number of ommatidia lacking rhabdomeres was counted using a Leica DMI4000B/DFC 340FX inverted microscope and a 40 × oil immersion objective. At least 50 ommatidia per fly and 5 flies per genotype were examined blindly for each time point. 20 female heads or 10 third-instar L3 larvae per biological replicate were homogenized by sonication in 200 μL of ice-cold RIPA-1% SDS buffer supplemented with Complete mini without EDTA protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5 to 10 μg of total proteins were supplemented with 2x LDS containing reducing agent (Invitrogen) and heated at 98 °C for 10 minutes prior to western blot analysis. This procedure was based on Fatouros et al. with some modifications<25>. Briefly, heads of 14-day-old females (20 flies per biological replicate) were homogenized by sonication in 150 μL ice-cold RAB buffer (Pierce) and Complete mini without EDTA protease inhibitor (Roche). Following centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant (“soluble fraction”) was collected and the pellet was homogenized in 150 μL of RIPA-1% SDS by pipetting. Samples were centrifuged again at 100,000 g for 1 h at RT and the supernatant was collected (“insoluble fraction”). The protein concentration was measured in the soluble fraction using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 5 μg of the soluble fraction and twice the amount of the equivalent volume of the insoluble fraction were used for western blotting.The western blots displayed in <Fig. 5> are representative of levels observed in both soluble and insoluble protein fractions at an exposure time that allows quantification. Noteworthy, these western blots do not reflect the relative proportion of soluble and insoluble hTau species. Such information is provided in <Supplementary Figure 4>. Protein samples were separated on Any kD Criterion gels (Biorad) and subsequently transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked in TNT buffer (Tris–HCl 15 mM pH 8, NaCl 140 mM, 0.05% Tween) with or without 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: pS202/T205-hTau (AT8, 1/2000, Thermo Scientific), pT212/S214-hTau (AT100, 1/2000, Thermo Scientific), pS262-hTau (1/5000, Invitrogen), T22 (1/1000, Millipore), total hTau K9JA (1/100,000, Dako), total hTau HT7 (1/2000, Thermo Scientific), Hsc70 (HSPA8, 1/1000, Cell signaling), HSP90 (1/1000, Cell signaling), α-tubulin (11H10, 1/2000, Cell Signaling) and β-actin (1/200,000, Abcam). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1/10,000, Invitrogen) were used for 1 h at room temperature and detection was performed using ECL chemiluminescence kits (GE Healthcare) and Hyperfilms (GE Healthcare). Bands were quantified using the ImageJ software (Scion Software) and results are expressed as mean ± sem. Total RNA was extracted from 1- and 5-day-old female flies (20–25 heads per replicate) using a Trizol-Chloroform-based procedure (Invitrogen) and subsequently treated with DNAse I (Ambion). 300 ng of RNA were then subjected to cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript Vilo Mastermix (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan primers (Applied Biosystems) in a 7900HT real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems)."

Survival of non-induced lines is shown as colour-matched dotted curves. Dysfunction and accumulation of the microtubule-associated human Tau (hTau) protein into intraneuronal aggregates is observed in many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Reversible lysine acetylation has recently emerged as a post-translational modification that may play an important role in the modulation of hTau pathology. Acetylated hTau species have been observed within hTau aggregates in human AD brains and multi-acetylation of hTau in vitro regulates its propensity to aggregate. However, whether lysine acetylation at position 280 (K280) modulates hTau-induced toxicity in vivo is unknown. We generated new Drosophila transgenic models of hTau pathology to evaluate the contribution of K280 acetylation to hTau toxicity, by analysing the respective toxicity of pseudo-acetylated (K280Q) and pseudo-de-acetylated (K280R) mutant forms of hTau. We observed that mis-expression of pseudo-acetylated K280Q-hTau in the adult fly nervous system potently exacerbated fly locomotion defects and photoreceptor neurodegeneration. In addition, modulation of K280 influenced total hTau levels and phosphorylation without changing hTau solubility. Altogether, our results indicate that pseudo-acetylation of the single K280 residue is sufficient to exacerbate hTau neurotoxicity in vivo, suggesting that acetylated K280-hTau species contribute to the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD. ."
PMC5032669_0,"How mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains poorly understood. We generated and characterized multiple induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from patients with MAPT IVS10+16 and tau-A152T mutations and a control subject. In cortical neurons differentiated from these and other published iPSC lines, we found that MAPT mutations do not affect neuronal differentiation but increase the 4R/3R tau ratio. Patient neurons had significantly higher levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and were more sensitive to stress-induced cell death. Inhibitors of MMP-9/MMP-2 protected patient neurons from stress-induced cell death and recombinant MMP-9/MMP-2 were sufficient to decrease neuronal survival. In tau-A152T neurons, inhibition of the ERK pathway decreased MMP-9 expression. Moreover, ectopic expression of 4R but not 3R tau-A152T in HEK293 cells increased MMP-9 expression and ERK phosphorylation. These findings provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of FTD and suggest a potential therapeutic target for FTD with MAPT mutations. New iPSC lines with MAPT p.A152T and IVS10+16 mutations are generated MMP-2 and MMP-9 production is elevated in human neurons with MAPT mutations Elevated MMP-2 and MMP-9 contribute to stress-induced neuronal cell death Mutant tau increases ERK phosphorylation that activates MMP-9 expression In this article, Gao and colleagues generated multiple iPSC lines from patients with MAPT IVS10+16 and tau-A152T mutations and found that significantly higher levels of MMP-9/MMP-2 in patient neurons contribute to stress-induced neuronal cell death. 4R but not 3R tau-A152T activates ERK, which in turn increases MMP-9 expression. These results provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of FTD. We thank patients and their families for their generosity. We also thank S. Ordway and Gao laboratory members for comments, and Y. Huang for providing one published tau-152A/T iPSC line. This work is supported by the   (F.B.G., B.L.M., E.M.M.), the   (2012-08-44 to K.F.), and the   (NS057553 and NS079725 to F.B.G.; AG019724 and AG023501 to B.L.M.). Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second most common form of presenile dementia, often causes changes in personality and behavior (<Boxer and Miller, 2005>). There is no effective treatment, and the molecular pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood (<Roberson, 2012>, <Irwin et al., 2015>). Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) are responsible for a substantial fraction of FTD cases (<Hutton et al., 1998>, <Loy et al., 2014>). Tau pathology is also a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its pathogenic roles and utility as a potential drug target in AD have been extensively investigated (<Wang and Mandelkow, 2016>, <Yoshiyama et al., 2013>).Tau helps assemble and stabilize microtubules. In the CNS, several isoforms of tau are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing (<Goedert et al., 1989>). More than 40 pathogenic MAPT mutations have been described in more than 100 families with FTD (<Cruts et al., 2012>; Alzheimer Disease & Frontotemporal Dementia Mutation Database, http://www.molgen.vib-ua.be/FTDMutations). Many MAPT mutations are either missense mutations or small deletions in the coding region or in introns, which can affect alternative splicing (e.g., of exon 10) (<Hutton et al., 1998>, <Niblock and Gallo, 2012>). Tau also modulates signaling cascades by acting as scaffolding proteins for signaling complexes such as FYN, GRB2, and PLCγ, and may also affect other cellular functions (<Ittner et al., 2010>, <Morris et al., 2011>).Many studies of tau toxicity have used cellular or animal models in which wild-type (WT) or mutant tau is ectopically overexpressed (<Morris et al., 2011>, <Wittmann et al., 2001>). Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an exciting alternative approach to study disease genes in their native genetic context (<Yamanaka, 2007>) and uncover novel pathogenic mechanisms in AD, Parkinson's disease, FTD, and other neurodegenerative disorders (<Israel et al., 2012>, <Soldner et al., 2009>, <Almeida et al., 2012>). Here we generated and characterized multiple iPSC lines from an FTD patient with a MAPT IVS10+16 mutation, an FTD patient with the tau-A152T variant, and a control subject. The MAPT IVS10+16 mutation is relatively common and found in many families in different countries (<Hutton et al., 1998>, <Janssen et al., 2002>). The tau-A152T variant has been shown to significantly increase the risk for both FTD and AD (<Coppola et al., 2012>, <Kara et al., 2012>) and induce aggregation-independent toxicity (<Pir et al., 2016>). To study their pathogenic mechanisms, we differentiated these newly generated iPSC lines, as well as published control and tau-A152T lines (<Almeida et al., 2012>, <Fong et al., 2013>) into postmitotic cortical neurons and identified upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) through the ERK pathway as an important pathogenic mechanism in FTD with MAPT mutations. To understand how endogenously expressed mutant tau contributes to eventual neurodegeneration, we obtained skin biopsies from two patients with MAPT mutations and a healthy control subject. Patient 1 was a male with a tau-A152T variant. The patient's clinical history and neurologic examination were consistent with a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Patient 2 was a male with an MAPT IVS10+16 mutation whose clinical diagnosis was largely normal at the time of skin biopsy but developed FTD later on. The control subject is a female family member of patient 2. Putative iPSC lines were derived from the fibroblasts as described previously (<Yamanaka, 2007>, <Almeida et al., 2012>), and 10–15 putative iPSC lines from each subject were extensively characterized. Immunocytochemistry analysis showed expression of stem cell makers such as OCT4, SSEA4, NANOG, TRA1-60, and TRA1-81 in all selected iPSC lines (<Figure S1>A). qRT-PCR showed that total and endogenous expression levels of the four reprogramming factors were the same in each line, confirming silencing of the transgene (<Figure S1>B). The iPSC lines had normal karyotypes (<Figure S1>C), and selected lines could differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers, confirming their pluripotency (<Figure S1>D). Based on these characterizations, we selected iPSC lines 3L1 of control 1, 19L3 and 19L4 of patient 1, and 3L6 and 3L9 of patient 2 for further study. In addition to the lines generated in our current study, we also used two published control iPSC lines, 2L17 and 2L20, derived from a male (<Almeida et al., 2012>), and one published iPSC line from another tau-A152T mutation male carrier (<Fong et al., 2013>). At passages 25–30, all fully reprogrammed control and patient iPSC lines were differentiated into postmitotic cortical neurons as described (<Figure 1>A) (<Almeida et al., 2012>). Four weeks after terminal differentiation, 80% of cells were positive for the neuron-specific marker MAP2, and there was no significant difference between control and patient neurons (<Figure S2>A). The percentages of VGLUT1-positive excitatory and GABA-positive inhibitory neurons were similar in neuronal cultures differentiated from control and patient iPSCs (<Figures S2>B and S2C). Moreover, the total expression levels of tau and PSD-95 were the same in 1-month-old neurons derived from control and patient iPSCs (<Figure 1>B).To further characterize differentiated human cortical neurons, we performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials were induced in 64% of control neurons, 78% of tau-A152T neurons, and 78% of MAPT IVS10+16 neurons (9–11 cells were recorded for each group, <Figure 1>C). The resting membrane potential did not differ among neurons differentiated from all iPSC lines (<Figure S2>D)."
PMC5032669_1,"Functional synaptic connections formed in these cell lines, as shown by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) that could be blocked with (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) (<Figure 1>D)  The mean amplitude, frequency, rise time, and decay time constant of sEPSCs were indistinguishable in all lines (<Figures S2>E–S2H). Thus, both molecular and electrophysiological analyses suggest MAPT mutations do not affect early neuronal differentiation. Therefore, any disease-relevant phenotypes would unlikely be due to changes in neuronal subtypes. MMPs, a family of Zn-containing proteolytic enzymes, modulate both normal development and human pathophysiology. MMP-9 directly cleaves Huntingtin protein in Huntington's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder (<Miller et al., 2010>). Moreover, dysregulation of MMP-9 in the CNS is a cause of neuronal developmental disorders (<Reinhard et al., 2015>). Thus, we set out to examine MMP-9 production in control and patient neurons with MAPT mutations. To this end, we performed zymography as described previously (<Biswas et al., 2010>), which measures the level and total activity of MMP-9. Tau-A152T neurons had >10-fold higher level and activity of secreted MMP-9 than control neurons (<Figures 2>A and 2B), as did MAPT IVS10+16 neurons to a lesser extent (<Figures 2>C and 2D). The total activity of secreted MMP-2 was more than 2-fold higher in patient-specific neurons than in controls (<Figures 2>A–2D). The level of secreted MMP-9 and MMP-2 was also increased in cortical neurons derived from a published iPSC line with the tau-A152T mutation (<Fong et al., 2013>) (<Figures 2>E and 2F). The effect on the total level and activity of secreted MMP-9/MMP-2 seems to be specific to mutant tau, since in progranulin-deficient FTD cortical neurons, there was no significant change in secreted MMP-2 level (<Figure S2>I) and the secreted MMP-9 level was below detection as in control neurons (not shown). This increase is likely in part due to transcriptional regulation, since the mRNA levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in tau-A152T and MAPT IVS10+16 neurons were higher than in control neurons (<Figure S2>J). The increased extracellular MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity in FTD patient-specific cortical neurons suggests that these molecular changes may contribute to disease phenotypes. To investigate this possibility, we first examined the relative survival of human cortical neurons derived from control subjects of patients with MAPT mutations without any inducers of cellular stress. We found that, indeed, TUJ1+ neurons showed reduced survival as measured by TUNEL analysis (<Figure 3>A). Interestingly, we did not observe TUNEL labeling in more than 100 glial cells (<Figure S3>A), suggesting glial cells are less vulnerable to increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels. We then examined the sensitivity of iPSC-derived human cortical neurons to different inducers of cellular stress. We treated these neurons with staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis (<Budd et al., 2000>); rotenone, a complex I inhibitor that induces mitochondrial dysfunction (<Sherer et al., 2003>); and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway with many downstream effects (<Li et al., 2014>). When measuring cell viability using the MTT assay, we found that patient-specific neurons are more sensitive than control neurons to cell death induced by rapamycin (<Figure 3>B) but not by staurosporine or rotenone (<Figures S3>B and S3C), suggesting compromised function in the mTOR pathway or related molecular pathways. For this experiment, we compared relative survival of neurons derived from the same iPSC line with or without the treatment with inducers of cellular stress; thus, the value from the MTT assay without stressors for each line was always taken as 100%.To examine the contribution of MMP-9 and MMP-2 to reduced survival of iPSC-derived cortical neurons with MAPT mutations, we quantified their mRNA levels in iPSC-derived 4-week-old human neurons treated with rapamycin for an additional 3 days. MMP-9/MMP-2 mRNA levels in tau-A152T and MAPT IVS10+16 neurons were significantly higher than that in control neurons (<Figure S2>J), and rapamycin increased these levels (p < 0.01) (<Figure 3>C). Human neurons differentiated from iPSCs are difficult to transfect at high efficiency. To examine the contributions of increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 to neuronal cell death, we used two compounds that are known to inhibit MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity (catalog #444278 and #444244, Calbiochem). We found that this treatment partially rescued the increased sensitivity to rapamycin and improved survival (<Figure 3>B). Furthermore, treatment with recombinant MMP-9/MMP-2 induced neuronal cell death in 4-weeek-old postmitotic cortical neurons differentiated from iPSCs of a healthy control subject, as measured by MTT assay (<Figure 3>D). MMP-2 and MMP-9 seem to induce cell death directly, since this treatment also increased the TUNEL signal in iPSC-derived neurons (<Figures S3>D and S3E). These results suggest that elevated extracellular MMP-9 and MMP-2 are sufficient to cause neuronal cell death in human neurons. Taken together, our data suggest that elevated level and activity of extracellular MMP-9 and MMP-2 are in part responsible for the observed loss of patient neurons under rapamycin-induced stress. It is known that MMP-9 expression is regulated by ERK (<Wang et al., 2006>). Therefore, to explore the mechanism by which mutant tau increases MMP-9 production in iPSC-derived patient neurons with MAPT mutations, we first examined ERK-pathway activity. The level of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) was significantly increased in tau-A152T neurons and to a lesser extent in MAPT IVS10+16 patient neurons (<Figure 4>A). It is worth noting that the level and activity of secreted MMP-9 in tau-A152T neurons is also substantially higher than that in MAPT IVS10+16 neurons (<Figure 2>). ERK phosphorylation in MAPT mutant neurons was blocked by treatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-mediated activation of ERK (<Li et al., 2001>) (<Figures 4>B and 4C). Correspondingly, the level and activity of secreted MMP-9 was greatly suppressed in both tau-A152T and MAPT IVS10+16 patient neurons (<Figures 4>B and 4C), suggesting that MMP-9 expression is regulated by the ERK signaling pathway in cortical neurons. To further confirm the regulation of MMP-9 by ERK activation, we treated cortical neurons of both patient 1 and patient 2 with lower concentrations of PD98059. We found the level and activity of secreted MMP-9 to correlate well with the extent of ERK phosphorylation (<Figure S4>A). Interestingly, the level and activity of MMP-2 was not affected after the PD98059 treatment in tau-A152T neurons (<Figure 4>B) and MAPT IVS10+16 neurons (<Figure 4>C). These results suggest that FTD-causing MAPT mutations increase MMP-9 through ERK activation, while the molecular regulation of MMP-2 induction in patient neurons remains to be identified.To further confirm the role of mutant tau in MMP-9 production, we first examined the 4R/3R tau ratio in iPSC-derived patient neurons. As expected, the 4R/3R tau ratio is greatly increased in MAPT IVS10+16 neurons (<Figure S3>F) but not in GRN mutant neurons (<Figure S3>G). Interestingly, this ratio is also increased, but to a lesser extent, in tau-A152T neurons (<Figure S3>F). We then transfected HEK293 cells, which do not normally express tau, with either 3R or 4R WT tau or tau-A152T. 4R WT and 4R tau-A152T were expressed at comparable levels, as shown by western blot (<Figure 4>D). However, the secreted MMP-9 level and activity in conditioned medium was significantly higher in cultures of cells expressing tau-A152T than WT tau (<Figure 4>E). The MMP-9 mRNA level was also higher in cells expressing tau-A152T (<Figure 4>F). Correspondingly, the level of p-ERK was also elevated in HEK293 cells expressing tau-A152T (<Figure 4>E)."
PMC5032669_2,"Interestingly, the level and activity of secreted MMP-9 in HEK293 cells expressing WT 3R tau and 3R tau-A152T are similar (<Figures S4>B and S4C)  ERK phosphorylation is also not affected by A152T mutation in 3R tau (<Figure S4>D). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that 4R tau-A152T activates the ERK pathway more strongly, which in turn increases the level and activity of secreted MMP-9. 4R tau-A152T expression (<Figures 4>E and 4F) but not inhibition of ERK activity (<Figures 4>B and 4C) also increases the total activity of secreted MMP-2, suggesting that tau-A152T increases the level and activity of secreted MMP-2, likely through an ERK-independent pathway. In this study, we found a significant increase in the level and activity of secreted MMP-9 and MMP-2 in cortical neurons derived from iPSCs of three subjects with MAPT mutations. More importantly, this increase contributed to neuronal cell loss induced by cellular stress, and inhibition of MMP-9/MMP-2 activity was neuroprotective. Our results are consistent with a recent paper published during our study in which the authors showed that MMP-9 is specifically expressed in fast motor neurons and contributes to selective neuronal vulnerability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<Kaplan et al., 2014>). Moreover, reduction of MMP-9 through genetic or pharmacological approaches delayed muscle denervation in vivo (<Kaplan et al., 2014>). Thus, MMP-9 is a potential therapeutic target for both FTD and ALS, although how MMP-9 induces cell death in iPSC-derived cortical neurons remains to be determined at a mechanistic level.Our studies also provide mechanistic insight into the increased level and activity of secreted MMP-9 in cortical neurons derived from FTD patient-specific iPSCs with MAPT mutations. The increase seems to be mediated by ERK-pathway activation. Indeed, ectopic expression of mutant 4R but not 3R tau in HEK293 cells resulted in ERK phosphorylation and increased MMP-9 production. However, the molecular pathways of MMP-2 induction remain to be further delineated. These results further support the notion that tau is not only a key substrate for phosphorylation but also functions upstream of several kinase signaling pathways (<Ittner et al., 2010>, <Morris et al., 2011>, <Vossel et al., 2015>). Our iPSC lines with different MAPT mutations will be useful for further investigations of the roles of endogenous tau in cell signaling and neuronal vulnerability, such as in an accompanying paper by <Silva et al. (2016)>. In the future, it will be useful to generate isogenic iPSC lines with different MAPT mutations and confirm the effect of endogenous mutant tau on the ERK-MMP-9 pathway. Moreover, since different tau strains with prion-like properties cause different tauopathies in vitro and in vivo (<Sanders et al., 2014>), it will be also interesting to determine which tau strains are present in iPSC-derived human neurons and activate the ERK pathway. Skin biopsies were obtained from two patients with MAPT mutation. Patient 1 was a 68-year-old man with a 6-year history of personality changes and cognitive and speech deterioration. He was diagnosed with PSP and has a tau-A152T mutation. Patient 2 was presymptomatic at the time of skin biopsy but had an extensive family history of FTD and has a MAPT IVS10+16 mutation.iPSCs were generated as described by <Almeida et al. (2012)>. In brief, fibroblasts were transduced for 7 days with equal volumes of supernatant from retroviruses expressing human OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC and seeded onto mitomycin C-treated SNL feeder cells. Five weeks after viral transduction, individual colonies were picked and transferred to 12-well plates containing feeder cells for expansion.

Figure 4 How mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains poorly understood. We generated and characterized multiple induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from patients with MAPT IVS10+16 and tau-A152T mutations and a control subject. In cortical neurons differentiated from these and other published iPSC lines, we found that MAPT mutations do not affect neuronal differentiation but increase the 4R/3R tau ratio. Patient neurons had significantly higher levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and were more sensitive to stress-induced cell death. Inhibitors of MMP-9/MMP-2 protected patient neurons from stress-induced cell death and recombinant MMP-9/MMP-2 were sufficient to decrease neuronal survival. In tau-A152T neurons, inhibition of the ERK pathway decreased MMP-9 expression. Moreover, ectopic expression of 4R but not 3R tau-A152T in HEK293 cells increased MMP-9 expression and ERK phosphorylation. These findings provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of FTD and suggest a potential therapeutic target for FTD with MAPT mutations.

These results provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of FTD. ."
PMC4271846_0,"Tau, a microtubule-associated protein with multiple phosphorylation sites, forms aggregates that correlate with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer Disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases, termed tauopathies. Hsc70 is a highly-expressed constitutive chaperone that can drive conformational change in proteins, prevent the aggregation of its substrates, recognize misfolded substrates, and facilitate their degradation. Here, we show that hsc70 binds to the microtubule-binding domain of tau in vitro and in vivo, without an absolute requirement for tau phosphorylation. Binding requires a carboxy-terminal region of hsc70 comprising its peptide-binding and variable domains. We have identified two hsc70-binding sites on tau and hydrophobic amino acids crucial for hsc70-binding. Interestingly, these hsc70-binding sites correspond to the β-structure elements that have been previously reported to facilitate tau aggregation. Thus, it is possible that hsc70 binding might directly inhibit tau-tau interactions that precede tau oligomerization and aggregation. Our results provide an important stimulus for research into how the hsc70-tau interaction might affect tau fate in normal cells and in disease. We are grateful to Dr. Henry Paulson for his gifts of hsc70 cDNA and antibodies, to Dr. Kiran Bhaskar for valuable guidance with BIAcore and protein purification, to Aaron Hobbs for the tau Δ305–335 and Δ336–367 plasmids, to Drs.

We thank Dr. Roger Brent and Stephanie Kwei for aid in yeast two-hybrid library screening. This study was performed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. in The University of Iowa Neuroscience Graduate Program (M.S.). Authors acknowledge the support of NIH grants NS32100 (G.L.) and AG14452 (J.K.). Tau aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles is a common denominator in neurodegenerative tauopathies [reviewed in (<Goedert and Jakes 2005>)]. In the human central nervous system, alternative splicing gives rise to six major tau isoforms, all of which are found in tangles. These isoforms can have zero, one or two N-terminal inserts (0N, 1N, 2N), and either three or four C-terminal “repeat” sequences (3R or 4R). These 30–32 amino acid (aa) C-terminal sequences, viz. R1, R2, R3 and R4 together constitute the tau microtubule-binding repeat region (MTBR). While this region has long been implicated in tau aggregation, recent advances have identified specific areas in R2–R4 that tend to adopt β-structure and might facilitate tau aggregation (<Giannetti et al. 2000>; <Li and Lee 2006>; <Mukrasch et al. 2005>; <Santa-Maria et al. 2006>; <von Bergen et al. 2001>; <von Bergen et al. 2000>).In vivo, tau aggregation involves a complex interplay of phosphorylation, conformational change and proteolytic cleavage, though the exact mechanisms are unclear. Hyperphosphorylation (i.e., excessive phosphorylation at physiological sites and at additional sites) is thought to dissociate tau from microtubules, causing tau accumulation in the somatodendritic compartment and an increased risk of aggregation. It was previously reported that tau hyperphosphorylation in cell cultures was mitigated by heat shock protein (HSP) chaperones (<Kirby et al. 1994>; <Wallace et al. 1993>). Subsequently, associations between tau and HSP chaperones from several classes, including hsp90 (<Dickey et al. 2006>; <Dou et al. 2003>), hsp70 (<Dou et al. 2003>; <Sahara et al. 2007>), hsp27 (<Shimura et al. 2004b>), and alphaB-crystallin (<Bauer and Richter-Landsberg 2006>; <Richter-Landsberg and Bauer 2004>) have been reported. Moreover, elevated HSP levels have been proposed to attenuate tau aggregation [reviewed in (<Smith et al. 2005>)].Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) chaperones are an important part of the cellular protein quality control and degradation systems [reviewed in (<Brodsky and Chiosis 2006>; <Mayer and Bukau 2005>)]. The HSP70 family includes the heat shock cognate 70 protein hsc70 (also known as hsp73) and the heat shock (inducible) protein hsp70 (also known as hsp72). Hsc70 and hsp70 share many similarities: both bind magnesium and ATP through their highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domains and bind polypeptides through a substrate-binding domain located just upstream of a variable/regulatory domain [reviewed in (<Mayer and Bukau 2005>)]. Hsp70 has low expression in unstressed mammalian cell lines while hsc70 is constitutively expressed in all mammalian cells. Mild stress elicits hsc70 upregulation in cells whereas relatively more severe stress induces hsp70. Hsc70 is enriched in the nervous system early in postnatal development (<D'Souza and Brown 1998>; <Morrison et al. 2000>) and has been calculated to comprise as much as 1% of soluble brain protein (<Schlossman et al. 1984>). A cytoprotective role for hsc70 may be particularly relevant in neurons where an attenuated hsp70 response has been correlated with high hsc70 expression (<Manzerra et al. 1997>). Also, there is evidence that hsc70 may be upstream of hsp70 activation (<Ahn et al. 2005>).In cells, hsc70 facilitates protein degradation through the proteasomal pathway (<Bercovich et al. 1997>) and the lysosomal pathway (<Chiang et al. 1989>). Hsc70 has been implicated in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of tau (<Shimura et al. 2004b>), as well as the ubiquitin-independent degradation of tau (<Elliott et al. 2007>). However, a direct association between tau and hsc70 (or any HSP70 protein) has not been demonstrated. Here we describe our identification of a tau-hsc70 interaction from an unbiased screen and demonstrate the direct binding between tau and hsc70. Our work reveals that hsc70 binds tau at two sites which are involved in tau aggregation and one of which is regulated by alternative splicing. The 0N3R and 0N4R human tau isoforms (thereafter 3R tau and 4R tau, respectively) were cloned into pRc/CMV vector for eukaryotic expression (Invitrogen, Inc.) as previously described (<Hall et al. 1997>). All tau deletion and substitution mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange kit). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.For expressing glutathione sepharose transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coli, a pET-GST vector was constructed by inserting the GST sequence from pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) into pET-17b (Novagen, Inc.). Wild-type bovine hsc70 cDNA (<DeLuca-Flaherty and McKay 1990>; <Newmyer and Schmid 2001>) was inserted into the pET-GST vector, resulting in full length hsc70 tagged at its amino terminus with GST. Truncations in the GST-bovine hsc70 construct were made by inserting stop codons through site-directed mutagenesis. Bovine hsc70 is identical to the human hsc70 aa sequence with the exception of an extra GGMP repeat downstream of aa 614 in the variable domain, i.e., bovine hsc70 is 650 aa while human hsc70 is 646 aa.His-tagged human 2N4R wt tau and its mutants #2–6 (<Fig. 5>) in pT7c vector constructs have been previously described (<Carmel et al. 1996>). Bacterial expression pET constructs encoding untagged 3R, 4R human wild-type tau, and truncation mutants #11 and #14 (<Fig. 5>) have been described previously (<Bhaskar et al. 2005>; <Brandt and Lee 1993>). The truncation mutants #12 and #13 (<Fig. 5>) were constructed by replacing aa 274 and 336, respectively, with stop codons using site directed mutagenesis. Mutants #8 and #9 (<Fig. 5>) were synthesized according to Makarova et al. (<Makarova et al. 2000>), making internal deletions of 93 bp and 96 bp, respectively, in 0N4R tau. A Hela cell cDNA library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid system as described by Gyuris et al. (<Gyuris et al. 1993>), using 3R tau as “bait”. cDNA libraries were constructed in the pJG vector and tau was expressed by the pEG202 vector. Positive interactors were identified by growing transformants on leucine-deficient medium. Confirmed positives were sequenced, then subcloned into pRc/CMV with an HA tag. Simian COS7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% bovine serum (Hyclone or Benchmark)."
PMC4271846_1,"COS7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and harvested 48 hours after transfection  SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in RPMI as previously described (<Lee et al. 1998>). SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 3R wild-type or mutant human tau in pRcCMV vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably-transfected SH-SY5Y lines were selected by 200 µg/ml G418. Immunofluorescence and Western blots identified clonal SH-SY5Y lines with robust tau expression. Cell lines with roughly equivalent expression of tau were used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM AEBSF, 2.16 mM leupeptin, 1.46 mM pepstatin, and 0.15 mM aprotinin. Following centrifugation to remove insoluble debris, cell lysates were pre-cleared by 1 hr incubation with non-specific IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Tau was immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antibody (<Lee et al. 2004>) or tau13 monoclonal antibody (gift from Dr. Lester Binder). Immunoprecipitations used either Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or Protein G Plus-Agarose (Calbiochem) and were resolved by SDS-PAGE.To increase cellular levels of the inducible hsp70 prior to immunoprecipitation, SH-SY5Y cells were subjected to thermal conditioning, such that cells received 2–3 “heat shock” treatments, interspersed with 24 h recovery periods, over consecutive days. In each treatment, cells were incubated in a 43°C water bath (“heat shocked”) for 40–60 min. On the final day, cells were heat shocked for 60 min, allowed to recover 5 h, and harvested for immunoprecipitation as above. Proteins in denaturing SDS loading buffer were resolved on Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels containing 8, 9 or 10% acrylamide (National Diagnostics) and transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore). PVDF blots were blocked using 2% gelatin (Bio-Rad) in Tris buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 detergent (TBS-T). Following incubation with primary antibodies, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research, eBioscience). Blots were developed with either Western Lightning ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer) or Amersham ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare). The following primary antibodies were used: tau5, tau1 (gifts of Dr. Lester Binder), 5A6 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), anti-hsc70 SPA 815 at 1:10,000 (Assay Designs), anti-hsc70 sc-7298 at 1:4000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-hsc70 sc-1059 at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-hemagglutinin 3F10 at 1:1000 (Roche) and anti-GST at 1:1000 (GE Healthcare). For re-probing, if necessary, antibodies were stripped from membranes by washing in TBS containing 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% SDS and 0.1% Tween-20 for 40 min at 50 °C. All recombinant proteins were prepared by expression in E.coli BL21(DE3)LysS cells (<Studier et al. 1990>). Bacterial cultures were grown in M9ZB broth with selection antibiotics and induced by 0.4 mM IPTG at OD600 ~ 0.8. After 30 minutes of induction, 200 µg/ml of rifampicin was added and the culture incubated for another 2.5 hours at 37 °C before harvesting. For GST-Hsc70 expression, IPTG-induction was performed at 30 °C.Purification of untagged tau protein from E. coli has been described previously (<Brandt and Lee 1993>). Briefly, bacteria were lysed in 30 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol with protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the bacterial lysate was subjected to DE52 (Whatman) and phosphocellulose (Whatman) chromatography. Tau was eluted from the phosphocellulose by 0.3 and 0.4 M KCl steps. His-tagged tau proteins were purified from bacteria by a Nickel-NTA Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Prior to surface plasmon resonance or GST-Hsc70 binding assays, tau was desalted and buffer-exchanged using Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad).GST-Hsc70 protein was affinity-purified from bacterial lysates using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). GST-Hsc70 complexed beads were washed at least 3 times, including a 0.5 mM ATP wash, and stored at 4 °C until further use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (<Bradford 1976>) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). A carboxymethylated dextran-coated Pioneer B1 chip was activated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To the activated dextran matrix, we coupled either purified nucleotide-free recombinant wild-type bovine hsc70 (Assay Designs) (hsc70 flow cell) or no protein (control flow cell). Hsc70 immobilization was evident from a 1300 Response Units (R.U.) increase in SPR signal. Excess uncoupled carboxymethylated dextran sites were blocked by subsequent ethanolamine injection. 3R and 4R tau analytes were dissolved in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20 and 1mM DTT. Tau interaction with immobilized hsc70 was measured at 25°C by injecting 60 µl of different concentrations of tau (25nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, 750 nM, 1000 nM and 1250 nM) at a flow-rate of 40 µl/min. SPR data was obtained throughout the association phase (90 sec) and the dissociation phase (at least 180 sec). Between analyte injections, the flow cell surfaces were regenerated by two consecutive injections of 10mM Glycine pH 2.2. The responses in the control flow cell were subtracted from those of the hsc70 flow cell. Using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (GE Healthcare), sensorgrams were globally fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Quality of fit was assessed from residuals, which show the difference between the calculated and the experimental curve at each time point, and the chi square value, χ2, which measures the closeness of fit. The kon (association) and koff (dissociation) rate constants were calculated using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The KD (equilibrium dissociation constant) was calculated as koff / kon. For GST-mediated sedimentation assays, GST-Hsc70 was pre-complexed to glutathione sepharose. In addition, prior to incubation with tau, the GST-Hsc70 was “primed” by brief incubation with 1 mM ATP in binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1–0.2% Triton X-100), followed by a wash in binding buffer without ATP. Priming was employed since ATP binding is thought to switch the hsc70 substrate-binding pocket to an open conformation, allowing it to be more receptive to substrates [reviewed in (<Mayer and Bukau 2005>)]. Also, priming would dislodge any bacterial proteins or degradation products that might have occupied the hsc70 substrate binding pocket during preparation or storage. Binding reactions proceeded 60 min at 4 °C, using purified recombinant human tau (150–200 ng) and a molar excess of GST-Hsc70 (8–12 ug) in binding buffer. GST-Hsc70 binding experiments were repeated at least thrice with different preps of each protein. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with tau. 5×105 members of a HeLa cell cDNA library were screened using 3R tau and 30 clones were identified. Restriction analysis of the 30 clones indicated that there were 9 unique cDNAs. Following sequence analysis of the 9 clones, one clone, which accounted for 2 of the original 30 isolates, was determined to be the heat shock cognate protein (hsc70). Sequencing determined that the clone encoded a carboxy-terminal fragment of human hsc70 comprising aa 360–646, which contained the hsc70 substrate/peptide-binding domain (aa 385–544) and a variable domain extending to the end of the molecule (<Chappell et al. 1987>; <Hu and Wang 1996>; <Wang et al. 1993>). Thus, the tau-binding hsc70 fragment excluded most of the nucleotide-binding domain (aa 1–384) of hsc70.To determine if tau and hsc70 interacted in mammalian cells, we expressed the hsc70 fragment (aa 360–646) and 3R tau in COS7 cells (<Fig. 1>)."
PMC4271846_2,"When we immunoprecipitated (IPed) tau from the co-transfected COS7 cell lysates, the HA-tagged Hsc70 carboxy-terminal fragment (HA-Hsc70ct) co-immunoprecipitated (co-IPed) with tau (<Fig  1>, lane 2). The HA tag did not bind tau or the anti-tau antibody, since a control HA-tagged 46 kDa protein failed to co-IP with tau (<Fig. 1>, lane 1). The multiple band pattern of tau, ranging ~45–55 kDa is due to differential phosphorylation of tau (<Medina et al. 1995>). The HA-Hsc70ct consistently co-IPed with tau under a variety of detergent and salt conditions (data not shown).As hsc70 protein is abundant in cells and its sequence is very well conserved, we asked if endogenous simian hsc70 in COS7 would bind transfected human tau. Endogenous hsc70 co-IPed with 3R tau (<Fig. 2A>, lane 1). Hsc70 was not detected if tau was absent or if tau was not IPed (<Fig. 2A>, lanes 2, 3). Similarly, we confirmed the binding of endogenous hsc70 to 4R tau (<Fig. 2B>, lane 1). We have noted that although tau can be expressed at high levels, the associating hsc70 was a very small fraction of the large pool of cytosolic hsc70 (typically less than 0.5%).To test for binding between purified preparations of tau and hsc70 and to assess real-time binding kinetics we utilized surface plasmon resonance (SPR). When different concentrations of recombinant 3R or 4R tau (analyte) were injected over immobilized recombinant bovine hsc70 (ligand), the BIAcore sensorgrams provided evidence of specific binding between tau and hsc70 (<Fig. 3>). The sensorgrams showed a good fit to a 1:1 Langmuir interaction model, as judged by the residuals being within 2 R.U. and the chi square values being under 10 (<Table I>). Kinetic analysis suggested that the 4R tau-hsc70 association proceeded faster than the 3R tau-hsc70 association and that the 4R tau-hsc70 complexes dissociated more slowly. SPR data suggested that hsc70 affinity for 4R tau was two-fold higher than affinity for 3R tau, with equilibrium dissociation constants of 0.31 and 0.16 µM, respectively. These data confirmed the yeast two-hybrid results in vitro and indicated that phosphorylation of tau was not required for the interaction.To further investigate the hsc70 interaction with tau, we conducted in vitro sedimentation assays using GST-Hsc70 and recombinant human tau. Hsc70 bound each of the human wild type tau isoforms tested: 2N4R, 4R and 3R (<Fig. 4>, lanes 1, 4, 7). In addition, we tested the smallest binding isoform (3R) for interaction with two fragments of hsc70. Consistent with our previous results, GST-Hsc70(1–359), which lacked the hsc70 sequence identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen, did not bind tau (<Fig. 4>, lane 10). GST-Hsc70(1–543), which contained the ATPase and peptide-binding domains of hsc70, did not bind tau either, suggesting that the variable domain, downstream of the hsc70 peptide-binding domain, was required for tau binding (<Fig. 4>, lane 11). This finding is consistent with previous reports implicating the variable domain in the retention of bound substrate (see Discussion). To map the binding site on tau, we tested a panel of tau mutants for binding to GST-Hsc70 (<Fig. 5>). For ease of reference, tau constructs analyzed for GST-Hsc70 binding are numbered in <Fig. 5> (extreme left). As indicated, the tau MTBR comprises sequences R1, R2, R3 and R4; alternative splicing removes aa 275–305 (R2) to generate 3R tau isoforms. The wild-type 2N4R, 4R and 3R tau proteins have been included for reference, as #1, #7, and #10, respectively. Hsc70 binding of 3R tau (#10) and 4R tau (#7) had already shown that the tau sequence encoded by exons 2 and 3 was not needed for binding. In fact, a large part of tau, immediately upstream of the microtubule binding region (aa 50–244), was not needed for hsc70 binding, as shown by #2. Further, the inability of #3 and #4 to bind hsc70 also excluded the amino terminus of tau as a binding site and, by comparison with #2, suggested that the microtubule binding repeats might be involved. The binding of #5 and #6, in light of the results from #3 and #4, excluded the extreme carboxy terminus of tau from our analyses and focused our attention on the tau repeats R1, R2 and R3. Additionally, the binding of #8 and #9 to hsc70 suggested that repeats R1 and R2 were sufficient for binding. The inability of #11 to bind hsc70 was not surprising, in the light of previous results from #2. Importantly, the inability of #12 to bind suggested that the binding site lay downstream of R1, while a comparison of #12 and #5 allowed us to narrow down the binding site to aa 274–282, i.e. the beginning of tau R2. However, this finding that aa 274–282 within R2 could endow tau with hsc70-binding ability was complicated by the fact that #10 (3R isoform), which lacked R2 (aa 275–305), still bound hsc70. This suggested that there could be more than one hsc70 binding site in the tau microtubule binding domain. Comparing #12 and #13 indicated that another hsc70 binding site was located within aa 306–335 of R3 (aa 305–335). This would also explain why #14, lacking R2 but containing R3, bound hsc70. Though #3 and #4 had indicated that the carboxy-terminal half of R4 lacked hsc70 binding activity, we could not entirely exclude the possibility of R4 having additional hsc70 binding activity within 336–355. Similarly, we had not excluded the possibility of hsc70 binding activity within 283–304. Subsequently, our analysis showed that sites at the beginning of R2 and R3 account entirely for tau’s binding to hsc70 (see below).As indicated in <Fig. 6A>, each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 contains a canonical microtubule-binding site (<Butner and Kirschner 1991>; <Ennulat et al. 1989>) located downstream of a 12–14 mer sequence. The 12–14 mer sequences at the beginning of R2, R3 and R4 were initially referred to as “inter-repeat” sequences, and those in R2 and R3 have been shown to influence microtubule binding (<Goode et al. 2000>; <Goode and Feinstein 1994>; Mukrasch et al.). Our deletion analysis had resolved a hsc70 binding site to one such region at the beginning of R2, aa 274–282 (<Fig. 6A>, underlined). At the same time, we had evidence of another hsc70 binding site within R3, aa 306–335 (<Fig. 6A>, underlined). We noted that aa 306–311 displayed considerable homology to aa 275–280. Specifically, 275VQII278 constituted a cluster of strongly hydrophobic residues (with the exception of Q) at the beginning of R2, and 306VQIV309 had a similar characteristic and location in R3. It has been shown that heat shock 70 proteins, including hsc70, can bind 5–7-mer sequences rich in hydrophobic amino acids (<Fourie et al. 1994>; <Rudiger et al. 1997>; <Takenaka et al. 1995>). We therefore hypothesized that a ΦQΦΦ site, where Φ represented a strongly hydrophobic amino acid, might mediate tau-hsc70 binding, as in the case of 275VQII278 and 306VQIV309. Noticeably, no part of R1, which was incapable of hsc70 binding (<Fig. 5>, #12), was homologous to 275VQII278 or 306VQIV309, while the beginning of R4 had only limited homology (337VEV339, marked by asterisks in <Fig. 6A>).To test our hypothesis, we disrupted the hydrophobic clusters in 275VQII278 and 306VQIV309 by site directed mutagenesis and tested the behavior of the tau mutants in GST-Hsc70 binding assays. Per our hypothesis, since 3R tau lacks 275VQII278, disruption of the 306VQIV309 site should be sufficient to affect hsc70 binding. We found that deletion of 308IV309 (ΔI308/ΔV309, <Fig. 6B>, lane 4) or deletion of 306VQI308 (data not shown) reduced hsc70 binding to 3R tau. We found that I308P and I308E point mutations also reduced hsc70 binding to 3R tau (<Fig. 6B>, lanes 7, 10). We did not test any amino acids downstream of Y310, since the Y310E 3R mutant retained its binding to hsc70 (<Fig. 6B> lane 13). Further, the inability of 3R tau to bind hsc70 following disruption of the 306VQIV309 site in R3 indicated that 337VEV339 in R4 could not serve as an alternative binding site. We next asked whether the disruption of the ΦQΦΦ in R3 could be compensated by insertion of a ΦQΦΦ motif into a different location."
PMC4271846_3,"To test this possibility, we chose R4, since it already had two valine residues in close proximity (337VEV339, <Fig  6A>). We modified our 3R tau ΔI308/ΔV309 mutant to create a VQIV site in R4, by replacing the E338 with (QI). In contrast to the ΔI308/ΔV309 mutant, this ΔI308/ΔV309 /E338(QI) mutant bound hsc70 (<Fig. 6B> lane 16), suggesting that the VQIV was sufficient for hsc70 binding. Turning to 4R tau, since 4R tau contains two binding sites for hsc70, disruption of any one site alone should not abolish hsc70 binding. Consistent with our hypothesis, hsc70 bound both the 4R ΔI277/ΔI278 and the 4R ΔI308/ΔV309 mutants (<Fig. 6C>, lanes 4,7). However, when both ΦQΦΦ sites were mutated (4R ΔI277/ΔI278/ΔI308/ΔV309), binding to hsc70 was clearly affected (<Fig. 6C>, lane 10).We investigated the effects of tau mutations, which decreased tau-hsc70 association in vitro, on the properties of tau in mammalian cells. Using COS7 cells, we expressed human 3R and 4R tau proteins with mutations in the hsc70-binding sites and tested mutant tau immunoprecipitates for the presence of hsc70. Endogenous hsc70 did not co-IP with 3R I308P or ΔI308/ΔV309 (<Fig. 7A>, lanes 2, 3). Also, there was a clear reduction in the amount of hsc70 associating with 4R ΔI277/ΔI278/ΔI308/ΔV309 mutant tau, as compared to 4R wild-type tau (<Fig. 7B>, lane 2 versus lane 1); mutant tau proteins were expressed and IPed similarly to wild-type (<Fig.7A and 7B>, panels on the right). As the mutations were located close to the canonical microtubule-binding sites in the tau MTBR, we also determined the localization pattern of mutant tau in transiently transfected mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts using indirect immunofluorescence: both 3R and 4R tau mutants showed co-localization with microtubules, similar to wild-type tau (data not shown). We also analyzed tau mutations affecting tau-hsc70 binding in neuronal cell lines. We established human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells lines with stable expression of 3R wild-type or 3R ΔI308/ΔV309 tau. Tau immunoprecipitation confirmed the association of wild-type tau with endogenous hsc70 and the lack of association between the tau mutant and endogenous hsc70 (<Fig. 8>, lanes 1, 4). Lastly, as hsc70 and the inducible hsp70 show similarities in their substrate-binding properties (<Mayer and Bukau 2005>), we investigated the association between tau and hsp70. To facilitate detection of hsp70 in the SH-SY5Y cells, thermal conditioning was used to elevate hsp70 levels, as described in Materials and Methods. While hsp70 associated with wild-type tau in these neuronal cells, the association was noticeably reduced by the ΔI308/ΔV309 mutation (<Fig. 8>, lanes 13, 16). Similar results were obtained using other pairs of clonal cell lines (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that hsp70 and hsc70 utilize either common or overlapping sites for binding to tau. An association between tau and hsp70/hsc70 was first reported in PC12 cells (<Wallace et al. 1993>). Later, hsc70 was identified in a group of brain lysate proteins that associated preferentially with phosphorylated tau (<Shimura et al. 2004b>). In the same study, in vitro phosphorylation of tau by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β enhanced the subsequent ubiquitination of tau, in the presence of hsc70, by the E3 ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein). Thus, the authors proposed that tau phosphorylation increased its association with a hsc70-CHIP complex, which facilitated tau polyubiquitination and degradation (<Shimura et al. 2004b>). Recently, an association between tau and hsc70 has also been inferred from an hsc70-dependent interaction between BAG-1 and tau (<Elliott et al. 2007>). Our findings reveal a direct association between hsc70 and tau that does not require phosphorylation and, as discussed below, suggest that hsc70/hsp70 interaction with tau may impact on tau aggregation.Our first indication that hsc70 could bind to tau stemmed from an unbiased screen for tau interactors using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Upon verifying that endogenous hsc70 and tau complexes existed in mammalian cells, we proceeded to characterize the interaction further. Surface plasmon resonance data suggested a high-affinity direct interaction that did not require an ATP-induced conformational change in hsc70. Though ATP-induced conformational changes are generally considered an integral part of the hsc70-substrate cycle in vivo, substrate binding can occur without ATP, as shown for hsc70-clathrin binding (<Prasad et al. 1994>). SPR analysis yielded submicromolar KD values for tau-hsc70 binding, which compare favorably with other reported KD values for HSP70-substrate binding (<de Crouy-Chanel et al. 1999>; <Rudiger et al. 1997>). The SPR data demonstrated that compared to 3R tau, 4R tau showed a two-fold higher affinity for hsc70. The difference in affinity is consistent with our subsequent identification of two hsc70-binding sites in 4R and one in 3R.In mapping the hsc70 binding site on tau, we employed sedimentation assays using GST-Hsc70 proteins (<Ungewickell et al. 1997>; <Wang et al. 1993>). However, the degree of tau binding observed in the sedimentation assays did not correlate well with the submicromolar KD yielded by SPR analysis. The lower binding efficiency of the sedimentation assay might be due to the higher detergent and lower temperature conditions employed relative to the SPR conditions. Also, the hsc70 in the sedimentation assays carried an N-terminal GST tag and N-terminal tagging has been shown to affect the substrate binding affinities of hsc70 (<Boice and Hightower 1997>). Nevertheless, the presence of the GST tag did not interfere with our ability to map hsc70 interaction sites on tau.The VQII and VQIV hsc70-binding motifs identified here agree with previous reports of peptide recognition by hsc70. Hsc70 has been shown to preferentially bind short peptides enriched in hydrophobic/basic or hydrophobic/aromatic amino acids (<Fourie et al. 1994>; <Takenaka et al. 1995>), which are characteristics of the KVQIINKK and VQIVYK sequences in the tau R2 and R3, respectively (<Fig. 6A>). While VQIVYK is present in all tau isoforms, KVQIINKK is present only in 4R isoforms due to alternative splicing. The importance of the isoleucine and valine in the interaction was proven by mutating or deleting the I308/V309, and by conversion of aa 337–339 (VEV) to VQIV. Previously, Rudiger et al. had proposed that 2–4 consecutive hydrophobic amino acids might constitute DnaK binding sites (<Rudiger et al. 1997>). Our data indicate that 1 or 2 consecutive hydrophobic amino acids can critically affect hsc70 (or hsp70) binding. Presumably, the flanking residues may control specificity. Our data also showed that formation of stable tau-hsc70 complexes requires both the peptide-binding domain and the variable domain of hsc70. This is in agreement with the general view that although the substrate-binding domain of hsc70 can independently interact with peptides, part of the variable domain forms a cap or lid which is required to retain larger polypeptides in the peptide-binding domain (<Boice and Hightower 1997>; <Hu and Wang 1996>).The sequences 275VQIINK280 (also known as PHF6*) and 306VQIVYK311 (also known as PHF6) have previously been identified as polypeptide regions involved in tau aggregation (<Giannetti et al. 2000>; <Li and Lee 2006>; <Santa-Maria et al. 2006>; <von Bergen et al. 2001>; <von Bergen et al. 2000>). Our data suggest that both sequences contain hsc70-binding sites as well. Interestingly, the KD values for tau-hsc70 binding are about two orders of magnitude lower than the recently reported SPR-derived KD for tau-tau binding (46 µM) (<Guo et al. 2006>). Thus, if the hsc70-tau interaction is stronger than the tau-tau interaction, hsc70 might competitively inhibit tau-tau binding. We hypothesize that hsc70 or hsp70 binding can interfere with tau aggregation. Consistent with this hypothesis, Sahara and co-workers have recently demonstrated that hsp70 decreases the heparin-induced in vitro aggregation of recombinant human tau (<Sahara et al. 2007>)."
PMC4271846_4,"The loss of tau aggregation activity, though, may not necessarily lead to a loss of hsc70 binding  For example, the Y310E mutation, which suppressed tau fibrillization in previous reports (<Scaramozzino et al. 2006>; <von Bergen et al. 2000>), did not decrease hsc70 binding with 3R tau.The location of the hsc70-binding site in the tau MTBR suggests that hsc70 cannot bind microtubule-associated tau. This is supported by the finding that hsc70 does not fractionate with tau-microtubule complexes (<Elliott et al. 2007>). The location of the hsc70-binding site also suggests that hsc70 might compete with tubulin or microtubules for binding to tau. The cellular level of hsc70 is reported to be 1% of total protein (<Schlossman et al. 1984>) while tubulin is estimated to be 2–5% of total protein in cell cultures and even higher in neural tissues (<Hiller and Weber 1978>). Therefore, both are present in excess over tau, which has been estimated to be a modest 0.25% of cellular protein (<Drubin et al. 1985>). The equilibrium KD for tau-hsc70 binding was between 0.16 – 0.31 µM in our SPR experiments whereas the reported KD for tau-microtubule binding has ranged from 0.15 – 1.10 µM (<Goode et al. 2000>; <Goode and Feinstein 1994>; <Gustke et al. 1994>). Thus, a close competition between hsc70 and microtubules for tau may be possible, with tau phosphorylation adding yet another layer of complexity.Our data implicating I308/V309 in tau’s binding to hsp70 similarly suggest that tau cannot bind simultaneously to hsp70 and microtubules. However, unlike hsc70, which does not associate directly with tubulin or microtubules (<Gache et al. 2005>), hsp70 binds microtubules, presumably through its N-terminus (<Sanchez et al. 1994>). This would allow hsp70 to simultaneously bind to tau through its C-terminal substrate-binding domain and to microtubules through its N-terminus. Consequently, hsp70 induction might enhance the partitioning of tau to microtubules, as previously observed (<Dou et al. 2003>).Hsc70 and hsp70, in the role of molecular chaperones, bind numerous newly-synthesized proteins (<Beckmann et al. 1990>; <Frydman et al. 1994>; <Qian et al. 2006>; <Thulasiraman et al. 1999>). Therefore, hsc70 may bind nascent or newly-synthesized tau, as previously hypothesized (<Kirby et al. 1994>). Newly-synthesized tau would comprise a small fraction of total cellular tau, which would be consistent with the very small fraction of cellular hsc70 that co-immunoprecipitated with tau from cultured cells.Our findings imply that hsc70 and/or hsp70 can bind all tau isoforms in the nervous system. Since hsc70 is ubiquitous and highly expressed in the cytosol, hsc70 would be in a position to complement, though not necessarily imitate, other chaperones acting on tau (<Dickey et al. 2006>; <Dou et al. 2003>; <Sahara et al. 2007>; <Shimura et al. 2004a>). In summary, we have provided evidence for a direct interaction between tau and hsc70. We have also shown that tau binding by hsc70/hsp70 chaperones requires hydrophobic motifs implicated in tau aggregation. This finding advances our understanding of the interaction between tau and molecular chaperones and may contribute towards therapeutic strategies based on leveraging well-developed intracellular chaperone systems to delay, prevent or even reverse tau accumulation and aggregation in disease. rhetorical Fig. 1 COS7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid encoding human 3R tau, with or without plasmids encoding either HA-tagged hsc70 carboxy-terminal fragment spanning aa 360–646 of human hsc70 (HA-Hsc70ct), or a control HA-tagged protein (HA-Control). Tau was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody showed HA-Hsc70ct (35 kDa) co-immunoprecipitated with tau (lane 2). HA-Control (46 kDa, lane 4) was not immunoprecipitated by the anti-tau antibody (lane 1). Lanes 7–12 show the same blot re-probed for tau. rhetorical Fig. 2 A. Human 3R tau was expressed in COS7 cells by transient transfection and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. Co-immunoprecipitating endogenous hsc70 was detected by immunoblotting (lane 1, arrowhead). Hsc70 was not detected if tau was absent (lane 2) or if non-specific IgG (lane 3) was used in immunoprecipitation. The ~98 kDa species (marked by *) in the lysate lane is a background band.B. Human 4R tau was expressed in COS7 cells by transient transfection. As above, immunoprecipitation showed that endogenous hsc70 co-immunoprecipitated with the 4R tau. Tau signal in the lysate (lane 6), upon longer exposure, displayed a multi-band tau pattern similar to the tau immunoprecipitate (lane 4). rhetorical Fig. 3 A range of 3R or 4R tau analyte concentrations was injected over a test surface containing immobilized bovine hsc70. The relative changes in SPR signal, as obtained by subtracting the signal of a control dextran surface from that of the hsc70 test surface, are shown. Analyte injection lasted 90 sec (association phase) and the dissociation phase, starting at time = 90 sec, was monitored for at least 180 sec. Sensorgrams shown are from a single representative experiment; however, multiple injections with a wider range of tau concentrations were used calculate the values shown in <Table I> rhetorical Fig. 4 Recombinant human tau isoforms 2N4R, 0N4R (4R) and 0N3R (3R) were tested for binding to GST-Hsc70 using GST protein as a negative control (lanes 1–9). Protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and tau binding was confirmed by immunoblotting. As controls, top and bottom panels in lanes 7 and 8 show the GST proteins as detected by anti-GST. Lanes 10 and 11 test the association between 3R tau and two deletion mutants of GST-Hsc70 that lack hsc70 carboxy-terminal sequence; the two truncated GST-Hsc70 proteins were detected by anti-GST (lanes 10 and 11, top panel). Full length hsc70 bound all wild-type tau isoforms tested (lanes 1, 4, 7) while two hsc70 deletion mutants lacking carboxy-terminal sequence did not bind tau (lanes 10 and 11, middle panel). Some recombinant protein preps showed some degradation, as in lanes 3 and 7. Input lanes depict the tau input: lane 3 = 10% (50 ng); lane 6 = 0.5% (1 ng); lane 9 = 1% (2 ng). rhetorical Fig. 5 A panel of recombinant tau proteins containing internal deletions and/or truncations was tested for binding to GST-Hsc70. Bolded numbers at the extreme left are for ease of reference in Results. Tau isoforms and deletions are listed under “Tau constructs”. Amino acid numbering is per the 441 aa isoform (2N4R). Only constructs derived from 2N4R tau had His tags. The + and − under “Binding” summarize the results of at least 3 binding reactions. The deletions revealed two hsc70 binding sites, shown by two pairs of dashed vertical lines. A binding site is located between amino acids 274–282, within R2, encoded by exon 10. A second binding site lies between amino acids 306–335, within R3, encoded by exon 11. Binding requires the presence of at least one site. rhetorical Fig. 6 A. Primary structure of the tau microtubule binding repeat domain, showing R1, R2, R3 and R4 (boundaries do not necessarily correspond to the exon boundaries). Amino acids 275–305, which are encoded by exon 10, are absent in three-repeat tau (3R tau). Therefore, in 3R tau, K274 is followed by V306, and R2 is omitted. Bold underlining marks the two hsc70-binding areas identified by previous deletion analysis (<Fig. 5>). The hydrophobic amino acids clustered in VQI(I/V) are represented by bold font in R2 and R3. A less hydrophobic cluster containing VEV in R4 is labeled with asterisks.B. Disruption of hydrophobic residues within 306VQIV309 impairs 3R tau-hsc70 binding. Tau mutants were tested for binding to GST-Hsc70 or GST control. Upper panels show GST-Hsc70 detected by a hsc70 antibody. Lower panels show sedimented tau and input tau. Input lanes represent about 1% (~ 2 ng) of the total tau input, except lane 18 which shows 0.5% (~ 0.9 ng). Note that the 3R Y310E mutation, positioned immediately downstream of 306VQIV309, did not impair mutant tau-hsc70 binding (lane 13)."
PMC4271846_5,"GST-Hsc70 also bound 3R ΔI308/ΔV309/E338(QI), a tau mutant in which the loss of I308/V309 in R3 was compensated by the creation of a VQIV cluster in R4 (lane 16) C. Coincident disruption of hydrophobic residues within both hsc70 binding sites impairs 4R tau-hsc70 binding. GST-Hsc70 bound 4R tau (lane 1) and also bound the 4R ΔI277/ΔI278 (lane 4) and ΔI308/ΔV309 (lane 7) tau mutants, in which only one of the two hsc70 binding sites had been disrupted. Hsc70 binding was severely impaired in the 4R ΔI277/ΔI278/ΔI308/ΔV309 mutant, which contained deletions in both hsc70 binding sites (lane 10).

In this particular experiment, the difference in tau levels (lane 7–8 and 11–12) showed that despite higher levels of protein present the 4R mutant tau was less efficient in associating with hsc70. rhetorical Fig. 8 Transfected SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell lines, stably expressing 3R wild-type or ΔI308/ΔV309 (mutant) tau, were subjected to thermal conditioning to increase hsp70 protein levels.

Hsc70 is a highly-expressed constitutive chaperone that can drive conformational change in proteins, prevent the aggregation of its substrates, recognize misfolded substrates, and facilitate their degradation. Here, we show that hsc70 binds to the microtubule-binding domain of tau in vitro and in vivo, without an absolute requirement for tau phosphorylation. Binding requires a carboxy-terminal region of hsc70 comprising its peptide-binding and variable domains. We have identified two hsc70-binding sites on tau and hydrophobic amino acids crucial for hsc70-binding. Interestingly, these hsc70-binding sites correspond to the β-structure elements that have been previously reported to facilitate tau aggregation. Thus, it is possible that hsc70 binding might directly inhibit tau-tau interactions that precede tau oligomerization and aggregation. Our results provide an important stimulus for research into how the hsc70-tau interaction might affect tau fate in normal cells and in disease. ."
PMC5974403_0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a dreadful neurodegenerative disease that leads to severe impairment of cognitive function, leading to a drastic decline in the quality of life. The primary pathological features of AD include senile plaques (SPs) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), comprising aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively, in the hippocampus of AD patients. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a key enzyme in this neurodegenerative disease, in particular, as it relates to tau hyperphosphorylation. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanism of the novel HDAC6 inhibitor, MPT0G211, using an AD model. Our results indicated that MPT0G211 significantly reduced tau phosphorylation and aggregation, the processes highly correlated with the formation of NFTs. This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment. In AD in vivo models, MPT0G211 appeared to ameliorate learning and memory impairment in animals. Furthermore, MPT0G211 treatment reduced the amount of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampal CA1 region. In summary, MPT0G211 treatment appears to be a promising strategy for improving the AD phenotypes, including tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, neurodegeneration, and learning and memory impairment, making it a valuable agent for further investigation. This work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 105–2325-B-002-039; MOST 106-2320-B-002-006-MY3). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, accounting for more than 80% of dementia cases worldwide. AD leads to the progressive loss of mental capacity and behavior, with a functional decline in the ability to learn. Several hypotheses have been extended to explain AD, including the cholinergic hypothesis, which was the first theory. The cholinergic hypothesis posits that the primary problem is a deficit in acetylcholine, caused by the death of cholinergic neurons<1>. Another primary hypothesis is that hyperactivation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by glutamate leads to the production of free radicals and the activation of enzymes that contribute to the death of neuronal cells<2>. Accordingly, four drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are used to treat cognitive manifestations of AD, namely, the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors revastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil, as well as the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine. These drugs have been revealed to reduce the progression of cognitive symptoms; however, the benefits are limited in more than half of the patients who take these drugs<2>,<3>. Thus new drug development for AD treatment is an urgent issue. Recent studies have focused on the amyloid and tau proteins as therapeutic targets. Although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear, present evidence suggests that the expression of these two markers may be linked<2>,<4>. For example, amyloid β (Aβ) not only spontaneously aggregates into the soluble oligomers, forming plaques resulting in network dysfunction, but also increases the accumulation of tau aggregates and the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which leads to synaptic dysfunction and eventually neuronal loss<2>,<4>. Therefore, the recent treatment strategies have attempted to manage AD by modulating the functions of these two major proteins.Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) belongs to the HDAC family, and its structure contains a cytoplasmic anchoring domain, which mediates its stable anchorage in the cytoplasm. The enzymatic activity of HDAC6 is exerted on tubulin, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and cortactin substrates; thus it has been identified as a key regulator of the cytoskeleton and cell migration<5>. Present studies have demonstrated that HDAC6 levels significantly increase in the hippocampus and cortex of the AD brain, and tubulin acetylation is reduced in the neurons containing NFTs<6>. While the detailed mechanisms of these processes remain unknown, HDAC6 appears to be involved in the process of tau hyperphosphorylation<6>,<7>. Tau is predominantly expressed in neurons where its primary function is to promote microtubule stability<1>,<4>; however, the hyperphosphorylation of tau has been suggested to impair its ability to bind and stabilize microtubules, thus promoting tau self-assembly and aggregation<2>,<4>. In addition to hyperphosphorylation, tau becomes abnormally accumulated in dystrophic neuritis around senile plaques (SPs) and in NFTs of the AD brain<2>. Recent studies have indicated that HDAC6 interacts with tau in human brain tissues, and the inhibition of HDAC6 attenuates tau phosphorylation at T231, a critical regulatory site for tau function; however, it does not disrupt the HDAC6–tau interaction<6>. Furthermore, HDAC6 inhibition also appeared to downregulate Aβ aggregation<8> and improve cognition in an AD mouse model<7>. In addition, a recent study indicated that mice lacking HDAC6 survive well and develop normally<9>, suggesting that the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 may not cause severe side effects. Collectively, these results suggest that HDAC6 may be a novel target of AD.The present study investigated the effect and mechanism of the novel HDAC6 inhibitor, MPT0G211 (N-hydroxy-4-((quinolin-8-ylamino)methyl)benzamide), on neuronal protection and cognitive function of AD models. We found that MPT0G211 significantly inhibited tau phosphorylation on Ser396, Ser404, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregation. The HDAC6 inhibitory activity of MPT0G211 resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased HDAC6–Hsp90 binding, and led to the ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau. In addition, a significant increase in phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment. In AD in vivo models, MPT0G211 treatment reduced the time spent by animals in finding the platform and closed arm in the Morris water maze and elevated plus maze test and reduced the amount of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampal CA1 region, which is related to learning and memory<10>. Furthermore, MPT0G211 appeared to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) after oral administration. Collectively, these results demonstrate that MPT0G211 has high potential as a treatment strategy for AD. Our previous study demonstrated that MPT0G211 (Fig. <1a>) exhibited potent HDAC6 inhibition (IC50 value = 0.291 nM) and was 1000-fold more selective for HDAC6 compared with the other HDAC isoforms<11>. In addition, MPT0G211 concentration-dependently increased the acetylation of α-tubulin in SH-SY5Y and Neuro-2a cells, the common used neuronal cell lines in the study of AD, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 μM without affecting the acetylation of histones, which is consistent with the selective inhibition of HDAC6 (Fig. <1b, c>). Similar results for the acetylation of α-tubulin versus control were obtained using another HDAC6 inhibitor, ACY-1215. SAHA, a non-selective HDAC inhibitor, treatment both significantly increased the acetylation of α-tubulin and histones. Nevertheless, 1 μM ACY-1215 treatment caused less acetylation of α-tubulin; these results were consistent with MPT0G211 exhibiting more potent HDAC6 inhibition than ACY-1215<11>. In addition, MPT0G211 treatment did not result in any significant cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y and Neuro-2a cells after 24 h (Fig. <1d>), suggesting that the concentrations used in this study (0.01–1 μM) did not cause cell death. rhetorical Fig. 1 a The structure of MPT0G211."

AD is characterized by the presence of SPs, which are extracellular aggregates composed of Aβ peptides, and NFTs, which are intracellular aggregates composed of hyperphosphorylated tau<2>. In addition, Aβ can increase the accumulation of tau aggregates as well as NFTs, leading to synaptic dysfunction and eventually neuronal death<2>,<7>. Therefore, tau phosphorylation was measured in SH-SY5Y and Neuro-2a cells transfected with the pCAX amyloid precursor protein 695 (APP 695) plasmid with tyrosine/histidine mutations of APP and the pRK5-EGFP-Tau P301L plasmid, which encodes human mutant P301L-tau, respectively<12>,<13>. The efficiency of the transfections was determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. <2a>) and western blot (Fig. <2b>). The phosphorylation of tau Ser396 was significantly increased in the cells transfected with P301L, and tau was hyperphosphorylated in cells cotransfected with hAPP 695 in SH-SY5Y and Neuro-2a cells (Fig. <2c, d>). Furthermore, we determined whether MPT0G211 treatment could inhibit tau phosphorylation. As reported, MPT0G211 treatment significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of tau Ser396 in both cell lines (Fig. <2e, f>). ACY-1215 treatment exhibited a similar inhibition; however, it was less efficient than MPT0G211. It is known that hyperphosphorylation also increases the capacity of tau assembles to form aggregates from oligomers to fibrils, eventually leading to their deposition as NFTs and causing neuronal dysfunction, including reduced mitochondrial respiration, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and impaired axonal transport<14>. Accordingly, we used an established method to determine whether MPT0G211 reduces the polymerization of phosphorylated tau<15>; 17-AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin), an inhibitor of Hsp90, was used as positive control. As demonstrated, cytosolic levels of tau associated with membranes and, in aggregates, were significantly increased in SH-SY5Y cells cotransfected with hAPP 695 and hTau P301L (Fig. <3a>). Treatment of the transfectants with MPT0G211 significantly reduced the levels of aggregated tau (Fig. <3a>). In addition, using flow cytometry to detect sub-G1 peak and annexin V-positive cells in apoptosis, we observed that MPT0G211 treatment significantly inhibited the plasmid transfection-induced sub-G1 population and annexin V-positive apoptotic cells increase in the neuronal cells (Fig. <3b–d>).

These results suggest that MPT0G211 not only inhibited tau phosphorylation and aggregation but also downregulated tau aggregation associated with the neuronal cell apoptosis. As previously described, a primary pathologic component of AD is the formation of NFTs composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Thus promoting the removal of these p-tau species may be a relevant therapeutic strategy. Although the significance of the chaperones that interplay in AD pathology remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that Hsp–ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)-mediated aggregate clearance plays a pivotal role in the AD pathology and further emphasizes the role of Hsp90 as a mediator of tau protein regulation and degradation<16>. Since Hsp90 is a substrate of HDAC6, the downregulation of the expression or activity of HDAC6 has been reported to promote Hsp90 acetylation, thereby favoring tau degradation<17>,<18>. Therefore, we explored the neuroprotective mechanism of MPT0G211 and whether it acts through Hsp90 and UPS modulation. As indicated, plasmid cotransfection significantly increased HDAC6/Hsp90 binding (Fig. <4a>). In addition, MPT0G211 treatment clearly enhanced the acetylation of Hsp90, which caused the downregulation of HDAC6/Hsp90 binding (Fig. <4a>). In cells treated with MPT0G211, coimmunoprecipitation of ubiquitin with p-tau (Ser396) clearly increased (Fig. <4b>), and the level of polyubiquitinated proteins significantly accumulated (Fig. <4c>). In addition, proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment significantly reversed the MPT0G211-induced inhibition of p-tau at Ser396 in both cell lines (Fig. <4d>). These results suggest that MPT0G211 inhibited HDAC6/Hsp90 binding and caused subsequent proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. rhetorical Fig. 4 a, b SH-SY5Y and Neuro-2a cells were transfected for 24 h with pCAX APP 695 and pRK5-EGFP-Tau P301L and incubated with MPT0G211 or ACY-1215 (0.1 μM) for another 24 h, after which the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against HDAC6, acetyl-lysine (a) or ubiquitin (b) and were subjected to immunoblotting. c Cells were transfected with pCAX APP 695 and pRK5-EGFP-Tau P301L for 24 h and were then incubated with MPT0G211 (0.01–1 μM) for another 24 h.

These results suggest that MPT0G211 inhibited HDAC6/Hsp90 binding and caused subsequent proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins.Moreover, we identified whether MPT0G211 also contributed to the attenuation of tau phosphorylation. Previous studies have indicated that GSK3β and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) are tau kinases, and these proteins have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD<19>,<20>. In addition, the activity of GSK3β is dependent on its phosphorylation at specific sites, including Ser9 and Tyr216, which can inhibit or increase GSK3β activity, respectively<19>. Therefore, we evaluated CDK5 and phospho-GSK3β on Ser9 and Tyr216 expression in response to plasmid cotransfection and MPT0G211 treatment."

Results are presented as the mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 compared with the control group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 compared with the indicated groups As previously described, a primary pathologic component of AD is the formation of NFTs composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Thus promoting the removal of these p-tau species may be a relevant therapeutic strategy. Although the significance of the chaperones that interplay in AD pathology remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that Hsp–ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)-mediated aggregate clearance plays a pivotal role in the AD pathology and further emphasizes the role of Hsp90 as a mediator of tau protein regulation and degradation<16>. Since Hsp90 is a substrate of HDAC6, the downregulation of the expression or activity of HDAC6 has been reported to promote Hsp90 acetylation, thereby favoring tau degradation<17>,<18>. Therefore, we explored the neuroprotective mechanism of MPT0G211 and whether it acts through Hsp90 and UPS modulation. As indicated, plasmid cotransfection significantly increased HDAC6/Hsp90 binding (Fig. <4a>). In addition, MPT0G211 treatment clearly enhanced the acetylation of Hsp90, which caused the downregulation of HDAC6/Hsp90 binding (Fig. <4a>). In cells treated with MPT0G211, coimmunoprecipitation of ubiquitin with p-tau (Ser396) clearly increased (Fig. <4b>), and the level of polyubiquitinated proteins significantly accumulated (Fig. <4c>). In addition, proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment significantly reversed the MPT0G211-induced inhibition of p-tau at Ser396 in both cell lines (Fig. <4d>). These results suggest that MPT0G211 inhibited HDAC6/Hsp90 binding and caused subsequent proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins.Moreover, we identified whether MPT0G211 also contributed to the attenuation of tau phosphorylation. Previous studies have indicated that GSK3β and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) are tau kinases, and these proteins have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD<19>,<20>. In addition, the activity of GSK3β is dependent on its phosphorylation at specific sites, including Ser9 and Tyr216, which can inhibit or increase GSK3β activity, respectively<19>. Therefore, we evaluated CDK5 and phospho-GSK3β on Ser9 and Tyr216 expression in response to plasmid cotransfection and MPT0G211 treatment. As demonstrated, phosphorylation of tau Ser396 and Ser404 significantly increased in the cells transfected with the plasmids, but no increases or mild increases in the phosphorylation of other sites (Ser262 and Ser356) were observed (Fig. <5a>). MPT0G211 treatment significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of tau Ser396 and Ser404 in both cell lines (Fig. <5a>); no marked changes in CDK5, p25, or p35 expression were associated with MPT0G211-induced phospho-tau downregulation; however, significant phospho-GSK3β increases on Ser9 through Akt phosphorylation were associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment (Fig. <5b>). In addition, a decrease in phospho-GSK3β on Ser216 was also observed. Accumulating evidence suggests that Aβ promotes tau phosphorylation through several mechanisms, including the activation of GSK3β<21>. Therefore, tau phosphorylation was measured in both cell lines treated with Aβ1–40. As reported, Aβ1–40-induced significant p-GSK3β (Ser9) attenuation and increase in p-tau (Ser396); MPT0G211 treatment diminished GSK3β activity and Aβ1–40-induced tau phosphorylation (Fig. <5c>). We further evaluated whether MPT0G211 treatment ameliorates learning and memory impairment. Using the Morris water maze test, we first evaluated the learning ability by training rats with a hidden platform. Triple transgenic (3×Tg-AD) mice, which harbor APPSwe and tauP301L mutant transgenes, are known to develop neuropathologies, such as plaque and tangles<19>. In this study, we used these mice to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of MPT0G211, and memantine (a drug that is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD) was used as reference compound. Oral administration of MPT0G211 significantly ameliorated memory impairment (Fig. <6a>). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that mutant transgenes mediated increases in total tau and tau phosphorylation at Ser396/Ser404 in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice that harbor tauP301L mutant transgene; MPT0G211 treatment significantly downregulated p-Tau (S396) and p-Tau (S404) expression and increased acetyl-α-tubulin accumulation in the 3×Tg-AD mice brain (Fig. <6b>). Western blot analysis also demonstrated similar results (Fig. <6c>). These results provide strong support that MPT0G211 treatments can ameliorate Alzheimer’s deficits. rhetorical Fig. 6 a 3×Tg-AD mice (aged 6 months) were orally administered MPT0G211 (50 mg/kg) or memantine (30 mg/kg) daily for 3 months; mice were then subjected to the Morris water maze, and their escape latency times were measured. b, c 3×Tg-AD mice were orally administered MPT0G211 (50, 100 mg/kg) for 3 months, then mice were sacrificed and their brains were removed for immunohistochemical analysis for acetyl-α-tubulin expression and tau phosphorylation (Ser396, Ser404) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (b) and western blot analysis (c).

A summary of the proposed neuroprotective mechanism of MPT0G211 is illustrated in Fig. <7>. Hyperphosphorylated tau can aggregate into filaments, and these tau filaments can continue to aggregate and form insoluble deposits, which are referred to as NFTs. This accumulation of abnormal proteins results in neurotoxicity in the brain, leading to AD. Thus inhibiting tau phosphorylation and promoting phosphorylated tau degradation remain the main goals of AD treatment<2>. Previous studies have demonstrated that HDAC6 is involved in the process of tau hyperphosphorylation<6>,<7>, and increased HDAC6 levels are found in the hippocampus and cortex of the AD brain<6>. Reducing HDAC6 activity has been reported to ameliorate cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model<7>,<17>. Mice lacking HDAC6 survive well and develop normally<9>, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme may not cause severe side effects. Collectively, these results suggest that HDAC6 may be a novel, promising target of AD.APP 695 is a plasma membrane protein known to be the source of Aβ<12>,<22>. Recent studies have indicated that significant Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 can be detected in APP 695-overexpressing neuronal cells, and Aβ can increase the tau hyperphosphorylation and decrease the solubility of tau<23>,<24>. In addition, transfecting tau P301L into cells results in proteins that are more favorable substrates for phosphorylation by protein kinases, increases tau phosphorylation, and also dramatically enhances the tendency for aggregation and polymerization into filaments, with resulting neuronal dysfunction<13>,<17>,<25>. In contrast, reducing the phosphorylation of tau at Ser199/Ser202 and Ser396/Ser404 appears to restore the tau-microtubule assembly<26>. In addition, by using different phosphorylated tau variants, it has been found that p-tau is toxic to the cultured cells<27>.An animal model for tauopathy has also revealed that p-tau is the primary factor for cellular toxicity<28>. In this study, the cells co-transfected with hAPP 695 and hTau P301L resulted in significant increases in the phosphorylation of tau Ser396/Ser404 (Fig. <5a>) and aggregation (Fig. <3a>), which then resulted in apoptosis (Fig. <3b–d>). Our results also revealed that MPT0G211 treatment not only significantly inhibited the tau phosphorylation of tau Ser396/Ser404, aggregation, and subsequent apoptosis, but also penetrated the BBB (Table <1>) and ameliorated learning and memory impairment in an animal model (Fig. <6>).The UPS is responsible for degrading the majority of cellular proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis."
PMC5974403_5,"During this process, molecular chaperones act as specialized machinery for assisting protein folding  A recent study has indicated that molecular chaperones may also be involved in AD pathology, and increasing evidence indicates that Hsp–UPS-mediated aggregate clearance is the pivotal mechanism of AD treatment<16>. Hsp90 is a major Hsp that interacts with diverse proteins, including tau, and previous studies have indicated that hyperphosphorylated tau can be recognized by Hsp90<17>,<29>. Following binding with Hsp90, the specific components of the Hsp90 complex determine whether the client proteins enter a refolding pathway or are targeted for degradation by the UPS<17>. In the ADP-bound conformation, Hsp90 associates with the client-bound Hsp70/Hsp40 complex and recruits the ubiquitin ligase carboxy terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein, directing the client to proteasomes for degradation<16>. Replacement of ADP with ATP can alter Hsp90 conformation, resulting in the release of Hsp70/Hsp40 and allowing the recruitment of p23, which can stabilize the client proteins<16>. A recent study has indicated that the acetylation state of Hsp90 modulates the function of Hsp90<30>. For example, hyperacetylated Hsp90 reduces the affinity of Hsp90 binding to the protein complex, which leads to impairment in the chaperone function and promotes client protein degradation<17>,<18>,<30>. Bali and Nimmanapalli groups have demonstrated that depletion of HDAC6 levels, or the inhibition of its deacetylase activity, results in hyperacetylation of Hsp90 associated with inhibition of ATP and client protein binding to Hsp90, eventually leading to polyubiquitylation and proteasome degradation of client proteins<31>,<32>. In this study, MPT0G211 treatment significantly increased the hyperacetylation of Hsp90 and p-tau (Ser396) ubiquitination (Fig. <4a, b>). In addition, proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment clearly reversed the inhibition of p-tau caused by MPT0G211 (Fig. <4d>). These results are consistent with the previous studies and indicate that MPT0G211 augments the polyubiquitination of p-tau and subsequent degradation.We also evaluated whether MPT0G211 plays a role in the modulation of kinase activities involved in the phosphorylation of tau. Among numerous kinases that have been implicated in tau phosphorylation, GSK3β and CDK5 have been identified as prime candidates for aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation at disease-associated sites<19>,<20>. In this study, inhibition of p-tau Ser396 by MPT0G211 treatment was not associated with changes in the CDK5 expression (Fig. <5a>); however, it was associated with phospho-GSK3β increasing on Ser9 (Fig. <5b>). GSK3β is a constitutively active protein kinase and its regulation is primarily based on the inhibition of its activity by phosphorylation on Ser9<19>; activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been identified to suppress GSK3β activity via Ser9 phosphorylation by Akt<33>. GSK3β activity is increased in the brain of AD patients, and overexpression of GSK3β in mice results in tau hyperphosphorylation and AD-like tau pathology<34>,<35>. Phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β occurs in the regions surrounding the microtubule-binding domain, whereas phosphorylation at these sites has been found to cause tau detachment from microtubules and lead to self-aggregation<36>. In addition, a previous study has demonstrated that exposure of neurons to Aβ increases GSK3β activity through the inhibition of PI3K signals, and blockade of GSK3β activity can prevent Aβ-induced neurodegeneration<37>. Herein, significant p-GSK3β increases on Ser9 through Akt phosphorylation were associated with p-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211; another p-GSK3β on Ser216 decreasing was also observed (Fig. <5b>). In addition, our results also demonstrated that MPT0G211 treatment diminishes GSK3β activity in Aβ1–40-induced tau phosphorylation (Fig. <5c>). Furthermore, we also revealed that MPT0G211 can penetrate the BBB (Table <1>), and oral administration of MPT0G211 significantly ameliorated memory impairment and tau phosphorylation (Fig. <6>). Collectively, our novel results suggest that MPT0G211 has a high potential as an AD treatment agent.

Six-month-old female B6;129-Psen1tm1Mpm Tg(APPSwe,tauP301L)1Lfa/Mmjax (3xTg-AD) mice and control B6129SF2/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), orally administered MPT0G211 (50 mg/kg) or memantine (30 mg/kg, dissolved in water) once daily for 3 months, and then subjected to Morris water maze. The assay that using 3xTg-AD mice was entrusted to carry out by Development Center for Biotechnology (New Taipei City, Taiwan). The water maze was constructed as a white circular pool filled with water, and the water temperature was maintained at 23–27 °C. A white platform was established and submerged 5 cm below the surface of the water and styrofoam beads were added to make the platform invisible. Animals were trained by permitting them to stay for 10 s upon reaching the platform. If the animals failed to locate the platform in 180 s, it was placed on the platform for 10 s to learn and memorize the location of the platform. Training was performed twice daily and 4 days during 1 week. Test trials were repeated twice with a 20 min interval for each animal. Scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 90 min before the test trial to induce AD-like features, except for the control group. The plus maze consisted of two open and two closed arms, connected by a central platform. Animals were individually placed at the end of either of the open arms facing away from the central platform. The time for each rat to move from the open arm to either of the closed arms was recorded. If the rat did not enter the closed arm within 180 s, it was gently pushed into the closed arm and assigned a transfer latency equal to 180 s. These experiments were performed in accordance with relevant ethics guidelines and regulations, which were reviewed and approved by the Animal Use and Management Committee of the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University (IACUC number: 20130361). This assay was performed by Eurofins Scientific. Briefly, SD rats weighing 200–300 g were provided by BioLasco Taiwan (under the license of Charles River Laboratories). Rats were sedated under general inhalant anesthesia (3% isoflurane) for blood collection using cardiac puncture 60 and 180 min after oral administration of the test compound. Aliquots of blood were gently mixed with lithium heparin, kept on ice, and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The plasma was then harvested and stored at −70 °C.

Each brain was homogenized in 3 mL cold PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 s on ice, and centrifuged at 5400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precipitated using acetonitrile precipitation and subjected to high-performance LC-MS/MS. Each result represents the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. The data were analyzed using the Student’s t-test. One-way analysis of variance was performed to analyze the animal data. Parameters with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a dreadful neurodegenerative disease that leads to severe impairment of cognitive function, leading to a drastic decline in the quality of life. The primary pathological features of AD include senile plaques (SPs) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), comprising aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively, in the hippocampus of AD patients. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a key enzyme in this neurodegenerative disease, in particular, as it relates to tau hyperphosphorylation. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanism of the novel HDAC6 inhibitor, MPT0G211, using an AD model. Our results indicated that MPT0G211 significantly reduced tau phosphorylation and aggregation, the processes highly correlated with the formation of NFTs. This HDAC6 inhibitory activity resulted in an increase in acetylated Hsp90, which decreased Hsp90 and HDAC6 binding, causing ubiquitination of phosphorylated tau proteins. In addition, a significant increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (phospho-GSK3β) on Ser9 (the inactive form) through Akt phosphorylation was associated with the inhibition of phospho-tau Ser396 in response to MPT0G211 treatment. In AD in vivo models, MPT0G211 appeared to ameliorate learning and memory impairment in animals. Furthermore, MPT0G211 treatment reduced the amount of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampal CA1 region. In summary, MPT0G211 treatment appears to be a promising strategy for improving the AD phenotypes, including tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, neurodegeneration, and learning and memory impairment, making it a valuable agent for further investigation. ."
PMC2289193_0,"Tau protein plays a role in the extension and maintenance of neuronal processes through a direct association with microtubules. To characterize the nature of this association, we have synthesized a collection of tau protein fragments and studied their binding properties. The relatively weak affinity of tau protein for microtubules (approximately 10(-7) M) is concentrated in a large region containing three or four 18 amino acid repeated binding elements. These are separated by apparently flexible but less conserved linker sequences of 13-14 amino acids that do not bind. Within the repeats, the binding energy for microtubules is delocalized and derives from a series of weak interactions contributed by small groups of amino acids. These unusual characteristics suggest tau protein can assume multiple conformations and can pivot and perhaps migrate on the surface of the microtubule. The flexible structure of the tau protein binding interaction may allow it to be easily displaced from the microtubule lattice and may have important consequences for its function. Tau protein plays a role in the extension and maintenance of neuronal processes through a direct association with microtubules. To characterize the nature of this association, we have synthesized a collection of tau protein fragments and studied their binding properties. The relatively weak affinity of tau protein for microtubules (approximately 10(-7) M) is concentrated in a large region containing three or four 18 amino acid repeated binding elements. These are separated by apparently flexible but less conserved linker sequences of 13-14 amino acids that do not bind.
