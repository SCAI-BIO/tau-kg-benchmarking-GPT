PMC4292886_0,"In Alzheimer disease, the microtubule-associated protein tau dissociates from the neuronal cytoskeleton and aggregates to form cytoplasmic inclusions. Although hyper-phosphorylation of tau Ser and Thr residues is an established trigger of tau misfunction and aggregation, tau modifications extend to Lys residues as well, raising the possibility that different modification signatures depress or promote aggregation propensity depending on site occupancy. To identify Lys-residue modifications associated with normal tau function, soluble tau proteins isolated from four cognitively normal human brains were characterized by mass spectrometry methods. The major detectable Lys modification was found to be methylation, which appeared in the form of mono- and di-methyl Lys residues distributed among at least eleven sites. Unlike tau phosphorylation sites, the frequency of Lys methylation was highest in the microtubule binding repeat region that mediates both microtubule binding and homotypic interactions. When purified recombinant human tau was modified in vitro through reductive methylation, its ability to promote tubulin polymerization was retained, whereas its aggregation propensity was greatly attenuated at both nucleation and extension steps. These data establish Lys methylation as part of the normal tau post-translational modification signature in human brain, and suggest that it can function in part to protect against pathological tau aggregation.

         FUNDING 
       This research was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NS07741). Tau is an intrinsically disordered monomeric protein that functions in league with the neuronal cytoskeleton (reviewed in [<1>]). Although it interacts with diverse cytoplasmic partners through its N-terminal projection domain [<2>], microtubule binding and promotion of tubulin assembly remain its most widely-studied activities. These are mediated by the assembly domain located in the C-terminal half of the tau molecule, composed of up to four imperfect repeats of 31 or 32 amino acids (i.e., the microtubule-binding repeat region, MTBR4) and flanking sequences [<3>]. In AD, however, tau loses its microtubule binding activity, and enters a pathway that culminates in aggregation and lesion formation (reviewed in [<4>]). Pathological tau homotypic interactions also are mediated by MTBR residues [<5>], including hexapeptide motifs 275VQIINK280 (termed PHF6*) and 306VQIVYK311 (termed PHF6) located in repeats 2 and 3, respectively [<6>]. Completion of the aggregation pathway and lesion formation correlates with neurodegeneration [<7>] and cognitive decline [<8>], consistent with a potential role in disease pathogenesis.The mechanisms that regulate entry into the aggregation pathway are not fully understood, but appear to involve post-translational modifications (PTMs) positioned to influence tau function, stability, and aggregation propensity [<9>]. The best established tau PTM is phosphorylation, which increases from ~3 mol phosphate/mol tau protein in post-mortem samples of cognitively normal brain to ~9 mol/mol in AD brain (reviewed in [<10>]). The location of tau phosphorylation sites has been established by a combination of antibody and LC/MS-MS analyses, revealing partial occupancy of at least 17 Ser and Thr sites in normal tau [<11>] and at least 40 sites in AD-derived tau aggregates (reviewed in [<12>]). The sites are widely distributed throughout the tau molecule, consistent with the unfolded structure of tau exposing the majority of Ser and Thr residues to phosphotransferases. Although the effects of phosphorylation on tau biology are site dependent, in general it inhibits tau function by depressing microtubule binding affinity [<13>–<15>] while increasing aggregation propensity by lowering the tau concentration required to support self-association [<16>].In addition to hydroxyl amino acids, Lys residues are modified on tau protein, and these too can influence tau metabolism and aggregation so as to antagonize or synergize with the effects of phosphorylation. First, tau can be ubiquitylated, which modulates tau accumulation and aggregation [<17>, <18>]. Five sites of ubiquitylation have been mapped by LC/MS-MS methods in filamentous tau isolated from AD brain, and these localize within the MTBR [<19>–<21>]. Second, tau can be acetylated, which can protect tau against phosphorylation of sites associated with microtubule dissociation, and thereby act as a gatekeeper for entry into the tau aggregation pathway [<22>]. However, occupancy of other sites can directly raise aggregation propensity [<23>]. Tau acetylation has been detected immunohistochemically, but the complete catalog of sites acetylated in vivo has not been established. Third, tau can be methylated, and this modification may contribute to regulation of tau metabolism by directly competing with both ubiquitylation and acetylation [<21>]. Seven sites of Lys monomethylation have been mapped on filamentous tau isolated from AD brain, showing that this modification overlaps with established sites of ubiquitylation [<21>]. However, the direct effects of methylation on tau function are unknown. For each of these three diverse Lys modifications, biological effects will depend largely on the sites on tau that they occupy in vivo. It is likely that certain combinations of PTMs preserve tau function, whereas others foster misfunction and entry into the aggregation pathway.To test this hypothesis, we have begun mapping modifications on tau protein purified from human brain using mass spectrometry methods. Here we extend the analysis to soluble tau protein enriched from pathologically and behaviorally normal human brain. Results indicate that the major Lys modification of normal tau protein detectable by high-mass accuracy LC-MS/MS is methylation, and that this PTM appears with greatest frequency within the MTBR. The results suggest that methylation is part of the modification signature associated with preservation of normal tau function. [14C]Formaldehyde (54.8 Ci/mol) was from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA), purified bovine tubulin dimer from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO), aggregation inducer Thiazine red (Chemical Abstract Service registry number 2150-33-6) from TCI America (Portland, OR), and trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI). Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids, glutaraldehyde, and uranyl acetate were from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). This study used only archival, de-identified post mortem human brain tissue samples from autopsies performed with informed consent of each patient or relative via procedures approved by the relevant institutional committees. Tau was enriched using methods detailed previously [<24>]. Gray matter was homogenized in 5 v/w of homogenization buffer (20 mM MES, pH 6.8, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) containing inhibitors of phosphoprotein phosphatases (10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4) and deacetylases (2 µM trichostatin A, 10 mM nicotinamde). After centrifugation (20 min at 27,000g), the supernatant was collected, adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled (10 min), and recentrifuged (20 min at 27,000g). The resulting heat-stable supernatant fraction was treated with 2.5% (final concentration) of perchloric acid. After isolating the acid-soluble fraction by centrifugation (20 min at 27,000g), protein was concentrated by TCA precipitation (20% w/v) followed by two washes in cold acetone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4292886_1,"Dry protein pellets were stored at −20°C until solubilized for LC-MS/MS  Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged 2N4R tau was prepared as described previously [<25>, <26>], and then subjected to reductive methylation [<21>, <27>, <28>] by incubating (22°C for up to 1 h) with 0.1 M NaBH3CN and 5 mM formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6. Reactions were stopped by the addition of glycine (50 mM final concentration). Non-methylated controls were prepared under identical conditions except that formaldehyde was omitted.For subsequent functional assays, tau reaction products were desalted (Bio-Gel P-6 resin, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl. Final tau protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). For subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis, tau products were desalted using protein desalting spin columns (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific) equilibrated in volatile buffer (50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8). Tau product was then evaporated to dryness and stored at −20°C until used.To quantify methylation stoichiometry, formaldehyde was replaced with [14C]formaldehyde at a final specific activity of 0.88 Ci/mol. Tau products were separated from radioactive reactant using protein desalting spin columns equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, then quantified by scintillation spectroscopy. Measurements were performed in triplicate and reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Methylation time course was modeled as a simple exponential growth to maximum using the function:

where kapp and ymax are the rate constant and maximum extent of methylation, respectively. Tissue-derived tau samples (400 ng) were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris-glycine gel; Bio-Rad). Protein bands were visualized with EZ Blue Coomassie stain (Sigma). Proteins migrating with 50–75 kDa mass were excised, cut into 1 × 1mm pieces, washed with 100 mM NH4HCO3, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Dried gel samples were then reduced and alkylated by rehydrating in 100 mM NH4HCO3 containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (60 min at 60°C) followed by incubation in 100 mM NH4HCO3 containing 55 mM iodoacetamide (45 min at room temperature in the dark). Samples were then washed with 100mM NH4HCO3, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Reduced and alkylated samples were then rehydrated and trypsinized in digestion solution (50 mM NH4HCO3, 5 mM CaCl2, and 15 ng/µL trypsin) for 45 min at 4°C. After removal of excess digestion solution, the samples were incubated at 37°C overnight. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted (37°C for 15 min with shaking) once with 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, once with 50 mM NH4HCO3:acetonitrile (1:1) and twice with 5% formic acid:acetonitrile. Extracted peptides were then de-salted using C18 PepClean Spin Columns (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer instructions and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Recombinant tau samples were handled as described above except that in some cases trypsin digestion was done in solution without preceding SDS-PAGE. Tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.5% acetic acid (solvent A) and fractionated on a 10 cm PicoFrit spray tip (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed in-house with sub-2 µm C18 resin (Prospereon Life Science, IL) using a nano-flow Xtreme simple liquid chromatography system (CVC Microtech, Fontana, CA) coupled to a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded onto the column in 98% solvent A at a flow rate of 0.6 µl/min, and eluted with a 60 min linear 2–40% solvent B (40% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid) gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 µL/min. After sample elution, the column was washed with 95% solvent B and re-equilibrated with 98% solvent A.Mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode with a data-dependent automatic switch applied between the survey scan and MS/MS acquisition. MS1 survey scans were acquired using a mass range of m/z 400–1,600 at a resolution of 60,000 at 400 m/z, and the MS1 target value was 100,000. MS/MS scans were acquired in the linear ion trap on the five most intense ions in each survey scan with dynamic exclusion of previously selected ions using a repeat count of 1 and exclusion duration of 15 s. Fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy 35%) was performed with a target value of 30,000 counts and an ion selection threshold of 5,000 counts. Charge state screening was enabled and ions with a +1 charge state were excluded from fragmentation. Other mass spectrometric parameters were as follows: spray voltage 1.35 kV, no sheath and auxiliary gas flow, ion transfer tube temperature 180°C, activation q = 0.25 and activation time 30 ms. A manually curated tau database containing all known central nervous system isoforms of Homo sapiens microtubule-associated protein tau was created. Mass spectra were searched against the database using both MASCOT and Bioworks 3.3.1 SP1 with SEQUEST algorithms. Search parameters included 20 ppm peptide mass tolerance, 1.0 amu fragment tolerance, static modification Cys + 57.02146 (carbamidomethylation) and variable modifications: Met +15.99491 (oxidation); Lys +14.01565 (monomethylation); Lys +28.03130 (dimethylation); Lys +42.04695 (trimethylation); Lys +42.01056 (acetylation); and Ser/Thr +79.96632 and −18.01054 (corresponding to phosphorylation and β-elimination, respectively). Tryptic peptides with up to three missed cleavages and charge-state dependent cross correlation (XCorr) scores ≥ 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 for 1+, 2+, and 3+ peptides, respectively, and ΔCn > 0.1 were considered as initial positive identifications. All MS/MS and spectra of identified post-translationally modified peptides from the initial screening were subjected to location probability analysis and manual verification. For MASCOT search results, modified peptides with initial MSCORE > 20 were retained and validated by manual inspection. Samples were prepared for CD analysis by desalting into 100 mM NaClO4 and 20 mM H3BO3 (pH 7.4). Spectra were collected (187–245 nm) at 20°C using a Jasco J-815 CD spectrometer (0.1 cm path length). Four repetitive scans (step size 0.5 nm; bandwidth 1 nm) were recorded, averaged, and corrected for buffer-only blank without additional filtering or smoothing. Raw CD signals (in millidegrees) were converted to mean residue molar ellipticity [θ]MRW as described previously [<29>]. Tubulin polymerization was assayed using the light scattering method [<30>, <31>]. Tubulin dimer (9 µM) was incubated (37°C) with either unmodified or reductively methylated tau (2 µM) in BRB80 (80 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2) containing 1 mM DTT and 1 mM GTP. Polymerization time course was followed by measuring absorbance at 340 nm every 1 min for 60 min in a Cary50 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Peltier single-cell temperature control accessory. Assays were done in triplicate to yield parameter means ± SD. The probability (p) of differences among measured assembly parameters was assessed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc multiple comparison test. 2N4R tau was incubated without agitation in assembly buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT) for up to 24 h (unless otherwise specified) at 37°C. Aggregation was initiated with Thiazine red (100 µM final concentration). Aggregation products were fixed in glutaraldehyde (0.5% w/v), adsorbed to Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and viewed in a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) operated at 80 kV and 16,000- to 60,000-fold magnification. Individual filaments (defined as objects >10 nm in length with both ends visible in the field of view) were counted and quantified with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Three or more fields were captured for each condition so that at least 20 filaments were counted per condition. Total filament lengths of all resolved filaments per field are reported ± SD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4292886_2,"Critical concentrations (Kcrit) ± SEE were estimated from the tau concentration dependence of total filament length using linear regression as described previously [<32>]  To estimate the filament dissociation rate constant (ke−), tau filaments prepared as described above were diluted 10-fold into assembly buffer containing 100 µM Thiazine red and incubated at 37°C. Aliquots were removed as a function of time up to 5 h post-dilution and assayed for total filament length. Disaggregation time series were fit to an exponential decay function to obtain kapp, the pseudo-first order rate constant describing the timedependent decrease in filament length, and L0, the total filament length at time zero. (2)
Rate constant ke− was estimated from kapp, L0, and the number of filaments at time zero as described previously [<16>, <33>, <34>]. The association rate constant ke+ was then estimated from the relationship [<32>]:

assuming a two state model (i.e., all tau was either monomeric or incorporated into filaments).Aggregation lag times, defined as the time when the tangent to the point of maximum aggregation rate intersects the abscissa of the sigmoidal curve [<35>], were obtained ± SE from each time series by Gompertz regression as described previously [<25>].The probability (p) of differences between estimated parameters (Kcrit, ke−, and ke+) was assessed by z-test:

where x1 ± Sx1 and x2 ± Sx2 are the pair of estimates ± SE being compared, and z is the 1-α point of the standard normal distribution using and JMP 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.05. To prepare material for analysis, soluble tau was isolated from the brains of four cognitively normal human males aged 55 ± 1.2 yrs (<Table 1>). In addition to meeting behavioral criteria, all cases were pathologically normal with respect to plaque and tangle lesion counts. Isolated tau samples were then proteolyzed with trypsin and subjected to LC-MS/MS. Resulting mass spectra were then interrogated using SEQUEST and MASCOT database search algorithms programmed to identify both unmodified peptides and peptides containing sites of phosphorylation (detected by either incorporation of a phosphoryl group or formation of β-elimination products dehydroalanine or dehydrobutyrine), mono-, di-, and tri-methylation, and acetylation. Any combination of two modifications was searched as well. Results showed that overall sequence coverage was 90% relative to longest tau isoform 2N4R, and included 90% of all Ser/Thr residues and 77.3% of all Lys residues in this isoform (<Fig. 1A>).Within the coverage area, we focused first on phosphorylation site distribution, which had been reported previously at low mass accuracy for both soluble [<11>] and PHF-tau (reviewed in [<12>]). We identified 31 Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites (<Table 2>) distributed broadly across the molecule, but with greatest frequency in the projection domain and in the assembly domain outside the MTBR (<Fig. 1B>). Seven novel Thr phospho-sites were detected at T17, T39, T50, T245, T263, T361, and T386 (<Table 2>). Although they had been identified previously in vitro after treatment of tau with protein kinases [<11>], this is their first demonstration in human tissue. A representative MS/MS spectrum generated by one of them, peptide 384AKTDHGAEIVYK395 phosphorylated on T386 (0.6 ppm mass accuracy), is shown in <Fig. 2A>. This site lies adjacent to the S396 – S416 region previously reported to be phosphorylated in both soluble and PHF-tau (reviewed in [<12>]). Identification of phospho-sites varied among cases, but previously reported sites T181, S202, T231 and S404, as well as novel sites T361 and T386, were found consistently in all of them (<Fig. 1B>). These data confirmed that the human brainderived tau protein samples were extensively modified, and that our methods were adequate for detecting tau modifications with high mass accuracy.We next searched for Lys modifications. No evidence for K+42 modification was found, indicating that neither trimethyl-Lys nor acetyl-Lys was present in the coverage area at the level of detection available in our datasets. In contrast, search criteria identified eleven unique sites of mono- and/or dimethylation (<Table 3>; <Fig. 1A>). The methylation sites were distributed broadly across the tau molecule and varied from case to case much like phosphorylation sites. Unlike phospho-sites, however, they localized with greatest frequency inside rather than outside the MTBR (<Fig. 1B>). An example of a spectrum identifying K311 as a site of dimethylation at 2.2 ppm mass accuracy is shown in <Fig. 2B>. This residue was reported as a possible methylation site in AD-brain derived tau protein on the basis of Edman degradation years ago [<36>]. It resides within the “PHF6” motif of the MTBR, which has been reported to mediate the aggregation propensity of recombinant monomeric tau in vitro [<6>, <37>]. Other methylation sites within the MTBR include K259, K290, and K353, each of which lies in a KXGS motif associated with AMP-activated protein kinase mediated regulation of microtubule binding [<38>]. In contrast, an assembly domain motif reported to mediate constitutive microtubule binding, 224KKVAVVR230 [<39>–<41>], was not methylated in these samples (<Fig. 1>). A second important binding motif, 274KVQIINKK281, was only partially resolved, but residues K280 and K281 were found to be unmethylated (<Fig. 1>).Within the N-terminal projection domain, Lys methylation was detected at K24, K44, K67, and K190 (<Fig. 1>). Two of these, K24 and K44, lie in close proximity to putative caspase [<42>, <43>] and calpain-1 [<44>] cleavage sites, respectively. Together, these data reveal that soluble tau resides in normal brain as a methylated protein, and that its sites of methylation overlap with motifs associated with pathological aggregation and with multiple competing PTMs. To prepare modified tau protein for functional assays, recombinant human 2N4R tau was subjected to reductive methylation (a well-characterized method for introducing Lys-specific methylation into proteins [<45>, <46>]). The rate and extent of Lys methylation was monitored in parallel reactions containing [14C]-formaldehyde, which served to donate [14C]-labeled methyl groups to tau. After 7 min incubation, [14C]-methyl incorporation averaged 5.5 ± 0.9 mol/mol tau monomer (<Fig. 3A>). By 60 min incubation, incorporation averaged 21.8 ± 1.8 mol/mol and approached saturation (<Fig. 3A>). To identify which sites were occupied near saturation, a non-radioactive 60 min sample was subjected to trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis. Sequence coverage was 65.2% and included 68.2% of all 2N4R lysines (<Fig. 1A>). Methyl groups were found distributed among 23 sites in the form of mono- and di-methyl Lys residues (<Table 4>). Two thirds of all resolved lysines were methylated, including six of the seven sites occupied within the assembly domain of soluble brain-derived tau (<Fig. 1B>). These results were consistent with the exposure of most Lys residues to solvent owing to the intrinsically disordered structure of tau monomer, and with the non-specific nature of reductive methylation. It is likely, therefore, that all reductive methylation time points had similar methylation site distributions but with varying occupancies. When subjected to CD spectroscopy, all methylated tau samples yielded spectra dominated by a broad minimum of ellipticity centered at 200 nm (shown only for the 60 min sample in <Fig. 3B>), indicating that tau protein remained intrinsically disordered even after high-stoichiometry methylation. In all, five tau samples were prepared, containing 0 – 21.8 mol/mol methyl groups. One of the normal functions of tau is to promote spontaneous assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers [<47>–<50>]. Certain PTMs occurring in the assembly domain, including phosphorylation and acetylation, can modulate this interaction [<13>, <14>, <23>, <51, 52>].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4292886_3,"To determine the effect of methylation on tau-promoted microtubule assembly, purified tubulin dimers were incubated at 37°C alone or with unmodified or reductively methylated tau, and the extent of tubulin polymerization was measured spectrophotometrically  In the absence of tau, tubulin polymerized only weakly (<Fig. 3CD>). In contrast, the addition of unmodified tau greatly stimulated polymerization at all time points, and tau methylated at up to ~9 mol/mol promoted tubulin polymerization almost identically (<Fig. 3CD>). However, methylation to higher stoichiometries depressed the ability of tau to promote microtubule polymerization, with 21.8 mol/mol incorporation rendering modified tau almost completely inactive (<Fig. 3CD>). Together, these data indicate that Lys methylation did not modulate tau-dependent tubulin polymerization until very high-stoichiometries were incorporated. The aggregation of tau into filaments is a well-documented correlate of AD. To determine the effect of methylation on tau aggregation propensity, the methyl-tau preparations described above were incubated in the presence of Thiazine red aggregation inducer under near-physiological conditions of pH, reducing conditions, and ionic strength. Thiazine red was used as aggregation inducer because it efficiently drives aggregation of full-length 2N4R tau into filaments having mass-per-unit length similar to authentic brainderived PHFs [<32>, <34>, <52>]. The reaction approximates a homogeneous nucleation scheme characterized by initial formation of an unstable dimeric nucleus, followed by filament elongation through monomer addition [<32>]. Under these conditions, the inherent aggregation propensity of tau can be quantified in terms of nucleation and extension components. Tau aggregation was monitored using transmission electron microscopy, which detected both filament morphology and length. Low magnification images confirmed that unmodified recombinant tau readily aggregated (<Fig. 4A>), but that Lys methylation impaired total filament length in a stoichiometry-dependent manner (<Fig. 4B–E>). High magnification images revealed similar morphology of both unmodified and methylated tau filaments (<Fig. 4AB> insets), indicating that methylated tau shared the fundamental aggregation characteristics of unmodified tau, but had a lower propensity to do so.To determine the mechanism through which methylation depressed aggregation propensity, the minimal concentration of unmodified or methylated tau required to support aggregation was estimated in the presence of Thiazine red inducer. Abscissa intercepts of tau concentration dependence plots revealed that the minimal concentration for aggregation of tau methylated to 5.5 mol/mol stoichiometry increased nearly 3-fold relative to unmodified tau (<Fig. 5AB>). However, this methylated tau did not differ from non-methylated tau with respect to sensitivity to Thiazine red inducer (<Fig. 5C>). These data indicate that Lys methylation depressed the intrinsic aggregation propensity of tau, and did so in part by increasing the concentration of tau needed to support fibril formation.In nucleation-elongation reactions, the minimal concentration approximates Kcrit, which corresponds to the equilibrium dissociation constant for elongation, Ke [<32>]. It therefore reflects contributions from both the dissociation (ke−) and association (ke+) rate constants for filament elongation (<Eq. 3>). As a result, changes in Kcrit may stem from changes in either filament stability (ke−), efficiency of monomer association with filament ends (ke+), or both. To differentiate among these possibilities, initial filament disaggregation rates were estimated for unmodified and methylated (5.5 mol/mol stoichiometry) tau by diluting preassembled filaments below the Kcrit and measuring filament length as a function of time. Under these conditions, loss of total filament length was found to decay following first-order kinetics as predicted for endwise depolymerization from a Poisson-like length distribution [<16>, <33>] (<Fig. 5D>). The dissociation constant ke− was derived from these data using the established relationship between tau mass and filament length [<32>]. Rate constant ke+ was then calculated from estimates of ke− and Kcrit using <Eq. 3>. Tau methylation was found to increase ke− nearly 2-fold and decrease ke+ ~1.5-fold (<Fig. 5E>), indicating that it raised minimal concentration by both weakening filament stability and slowing the rate of elongation.In a homogeneous nucleation dependent reaction, the rate limiting step involves formation of a thermodynamic nucleus, defined as the least stable species reversibly interconverting with monomer [<53>]. To determine whether methylation affected nucleation rate, tau aggregation time course was quantified for both unmodified and methylated (5.5 mol/mol stoichiometry) tau in the presence of Thiazine red. Because homogeneous nucleation rate is influenced by the degree of supersaturation (i.e., the concentration of monomer above the critical concentration; [<54>]), the two tau preparations were normalized for supersaturation at the start of time course measurements. When quantified over 24 h, both time series displayed lag, exponential growth, and plateau phases (<Fig. 6A>). Reaction lag times, which vary inversely with nucleation rate [<35>], were then estimated by fitting data with a 3-parameter Gompertz growth function. Under these conditions, methylated tau aggregated with a significantly longer lag time relative to unmodified tau (<Fig. 6B>). These data show that Lys methylation slows the nucleation phase of the tau aggregation reaction. Overall, multi-site Lys methylation at 5.5 mol/mol can depress tau aggregation at both the nucleation and elongation steps without affecting microtubule polymerizing activity. These findings are significant in several respects. First, they confirm that normal human tau protein is extensively phosphorylated in vivo. At least 31 Ser and Thr residues distributed broadly across projection and assembly domains were found to be modified, with local hot spots lying mostly outside the MTBR. The distribution was consistent with previous studies of normal human brain, where substantial site overlap between normal and AD-derived tau was observed [<11>, <55>]. Including the seven new sites discovered herein, the total number of phosphorylated residues identified by all methods in normal or diseased human brain tissue now stands at 52, representing well over half of all hydroxyl amino acids in tau. The overall distribution is consistent with tau interacting with phosphotransferases in a conformation where the majority of phosphorylatable residues are accessible.Increases in tau phosphorylation site occupancy, especially at KXGS motifs, can reduce microtubule binding function [<13>, <38>], and therefore may represent a key step in AD pathogenesis. However, considering that hyperphosphorylation occurs in fetal development [<56>] and hibernation [<57>] without filamentous aggregation, hyperphosphorylation of tau per se does not appear to dictate entry into the tau aggregation pathway. Rather, interaction with other modifications, such as those occurring on Lys residues, may antagonize or synergize with phosphorylation to drive aggregation and lesion formation. Thus a second significant finding here is that mono- and di-methylation represent the major physiological Lys modifications in normal brain. Much like phosphorylation sites, tau methylation sites were found distributed across both projection and assembly domains, consistent with broad exposure of Lys residues to modification enzymes, and offering opportunities for cross talk with other PTMs. In the projection domain, methylation sites K24 and K44 lie adjacent to putative caspase and calpain cleavage sites, respectively. The latter cleavage event is reportedly associated with toxicity in biological models [<44>, <58>– <60>]. In the MTBR, where the majority of Lys methylation was found, sites overlapped with three of five reported ubiquitylation sites on AD-derived filamentous tau.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4292886_4,"In addition, the Lys component of three out of four KXGS motifs (K259, K290, and K353) were occupied, with the fourth, K321, lying outside the area of coverage  Thus, Lys methylation sites are positioned to potentially influence tau metabolism through cross-talk with other PTMs.Within the tau projection domain, K163, K174, and/or K180 have been reported as acetylation sites in vivo, with occupancy detectable in normal brain and increasing with Braak stage in AD brain [<61>]. Within the MTBR, two sites adjacent or within the PHF6* motif (K274 and K280; [<62>, <63>]), and AMP-dependent protein kinase recognition sites K259 and K353 [<22>], were reported to be acetylated as well. Although on the basis of immunoblot analysis K280 [<63>] and K274 [<62>] were unoccupied in normal brain, occupancy of K259 and K353 was reportedly highest in normal brain and should have been detected by our LC-MS/MS approach along with K163, K174, and K180. Because each of these residues was resolved in our area of coverage, failure to detect tau acetylation may reflect poor preservation of this modification during purification. Nonetheless, it was possible to detect methylation at these Lys residues, raising the potential for direct cross talk with modifications such as acetylation.In addition to participation in cross talk, methylation of the tau assembly domain could directly affect tau biology. A third significant finding here was that mono- and di-methylation greatly suppressed tau aggregation propensity by depressing nucleation rate, inhibiting elongation rate, and destabilizing mature filaments (<Fig. 7>). Previously we reported that these same steps were augmented by exon 10 inclusion and certain missense tau mutations associated with frontotemporal dementia (<Fig. 7>). In contrast, little effect on tubulin assembly was noted until methylation stoichiometries reached very high levels. Thus, multi-site Lys methylation is a candidate modification for suppressing aggregation propensity while preserving tubulin assembly-promoting activity. This conclusion is based on the use of reductive methylation to prepare methylated tau. Because this method is non-specific, it allowed control over modification stoichiometry but not over site distribution. Although the sites modified in vivo and reductive methylation overlapped, the latter incorporated detectable levels of methylation into more sites. Therefore, the functional consequences of methylation should be considered tentative until it can be recapitulated with greater control over site specificity.The enzymes that catalyze tau methylation and dimethylation are unknown. Relative to the phosphotransferase field, the protein methylation field is young, with the first histone Lys methyltransferase and demethylase being reported only in 2000 and 2004, respectively [<45>, <64>, <65>]. Since that time, 208 putative methyltransferases have been identified in the human genome, with 57 of them containing SET domains associated with protein lysine methyltransferase activity [<66>]. Only a subset of these has been studied in depth, with most effort being directed toward nuclear enzymes owing to the importance of histone modification. Nonetheless, Lys methyltransferase activity has been found in the cytoplasm [<67>, <68>]. Identification of tau methyltransferases will likely yield additional insights into the role of methylation in normal biology.In the cell nucleus, Lys methylation of histones is a stable yet reversible mark that influences gene expression (reviewed in [<69>]). It remains to be seen whether the normal tau methylation pattern deduced herein is stable through development and aging. However, it does differ from the reported methylation pattern of PHF-tau isolated from AD brain [<21>]. With respect to methylation site distribution, PHF-tau contained fewer sites overall, with only three sites in the MTBR (<Fig. 1B>). Moreover, PHF-tau modification was limited to monomethylation, whereas normal tau contained dimethyl-Lys at eight of eleven identified sites. These data indicate that PHF-tau and normal soluble tau differ qualitatively with respect to Lys methylation. It will be important to determine whether the lower site frequency and bias toward monomethylation in PHF-tau is accompanied by lower site occupancy. If so, then increasing tau methylation may be a tractable approach for depressing tau aggregation and neurofibrillary lesion formation in AD.In summary, the data identify Lys methylation as part of the normal modification signature of tau protein in human brain. In addition to indirect effects owing to PTM crosstalk, Lys methylation can directly affect tau biology by lowering aggregation propensity. It may also affect other aspects of tau biology not investigated here, such as the ability of tau to interact with its many known binding partners including signaling molecules and cytoskeletal elements (reviewed in [<1>]). We propose that multiple tau PTMs, including phosphorylation and methylation, act in concert to affect both normal and pathological functions of tau. rhetorical Figure 1 (A) Identified tryptic peptides in the context of the human 2N4R isoform (NCBI accession number NP_005901), where the dotted underline depicts projection domain segments n1 and n2, the solid underline identifies the MTBR (as defined by [<70>]), and PHF6/PHF6* mark the hexapeptide segments involved in filament nucleation.

Methylation increased lag time relative to unmodified tau (***, p < 0.001). rhetorical Figure 7 This nucleation-elongation scheme for tau aggregation was deduced on the basis of in vitro experimentation [<32>]. Once assembly competent tau species form (Uc), the rate-limiting step in tau fibrillization is dimer formation, which represents the thermodynamic nucleus (N). Following nucleation, extension occurs through further addition of assembly competent monomers to the filament (F) ends. Lys-methylation inhibits filament formation by slowing nucleation and extension rates, and by destabilizing mature filaments. Conversely, these same steps are reportedly augmented by missense mutants associated with frontotemporal dementia (R5L, G272V, P301L, and V337M; [<72>]) and by normal tau isoforms that include microtubule binding repeat r2 through alternative splicing of exon 10 [<34>].

Although hyper-phosphorylation of tau Ser and Thr residues is an established trigger of tau misfunction and aggregation, tau modifications extend to Lys residues as well, raising the possibility that different modification signatures depress or promote aggregation propensity depending on site occupancy. To identify Lys-residue modifications associated with normal tau function, soluble tau proteins isolated from four cognitively normal human brains were characterized by mass spectrometry methods. The major detectable Lys modification was found to be methylation, which appeared in the form of mono- and di-methyl Lys residues distributed among at least eleven sites. Unlike tau phosphorylation sites, the frequency of Lys methylation was highest in the microtubule binding repeat region that mediates both microtubule binding and homotypic interactions. When purified recombinant human tau was modified in vitro through reductive methylation, its ability to promote tubulin polymerization was retained, whereas its aggregation propensity was greatly attenuated at both nucleation and extension steps. These data establish Lys methylation as part of the normal tau post-translational modification signature in human brain, and suggest that it can function in part to protect against pathological tau aggregation. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC2667488_0,"In astrocytes, the inflammatory induction of Nitric Oxide Synthase type 2 (NOS2) is inhibited by noradrenaline (NA) at the transcriptional level however its effects on specific transcription factors are not fully known. Recent studies show that the activity of several transcription factors including C/EBPβ, which is needed for maximal NOS2 expression, is modulated by conjugation of the small molecular weight protein SUMO. We examined whether the expression of SUMO Related Genes (SRGs: SUMO-1, the conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and the protease SENP1) are affected by inflammatory conditions or NA and whether SUMO-1 regulates NOS2 through interaction with C/EBPβ. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammatory responses including NOS2 expression in primary astrocytes. The mRNA levels of SRGs were determined by QPCR. A functional role for SUMOylation was evaluated by determining effects of over-expressing SRGs on NOS2 promoter and NFκB binding-element reporter constructs. Interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ with the NOS2 promoter were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interactions of SUMO-1 with C/EBPβ were examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. LPS decreased mRNA levels of SUMO-1, Ubc9 and SENP1 in primary astrocytes and a similar decrease occurred during normal aging in brain. NA attenuated the LPS-induced reductions and increased SUMO-1 above basal levels. Over-expression of SUMO-1, Ubc9, or SENP1 reduced the activation of a NOS2 promoter, whereas activation of a 4 × NFκB binding-element reporter was only reduced by SUMO-1. ChIP studies revealed interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ with C/EBP binding sites on the NOS2 promoter that were modulated by LPS and NA. SUMO-1 co-precipitated with C/EBPβ and a close proximity was confirmed by FRET analysis. Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates NOS2 expression in astrocytes, and point to modification of C/EBPβ as a possible mechanism of action. Targeting the SUMOylation pathway may therefore offer a novel means to regulate inflammatory NOS2 expression in neurological conditions and diseases. This work was supported in part by NIH grant NS04495 (DLF) Nitric oxide generated by Nitric Oxide Synthase type 2 (NOS2, also termed iNOS) contributes to disease progression in a variety of neurological diseases and conditions. NOS2 is the calcium-independent isoform of the NOS family whose expression is generally restricted, but is highly and rapidly induced upon activation by a variety of stimuli, among them cytokines and bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Several investigators have confirmed NOS2 expression in primary astrocytes upon inflammatory induction [<1>-<4>] as well as in neurological diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), its animal model EAE [<5>-<7>], cerebral ischemia [<8>], and Alzheimer's disease [<9>-<11>].Transcription of the NOS2 gene has been shown to require activation of transcription factor NFκB [<12>,<13>]; however in many cell types activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are necessary for maximal NOS2 expression [<14>-<18>]. The C/EBPs constitute a family of basic leucine-zipper transcription factors which form homo and hetero dimers that bind to similar cis-regulatory elements with varying affinities [<19>,<20>]. The leucine-zipper motif constitutes the dimerization domain of the C/EBP protein whereas the basic region is the DNA contact area that determines binding specificity. C/EBP isoforms include C/EBPα, C/EBPβ (also known as NF-IL6, IL-6-DBP, LAP, AGP/EBP, or CRP2), C/EBPδ (also called CRP3, CELF, or NF-IL6b), C/EBPγ (IgEBP), C/EBPε (CRP1), and C/EBPζ (CHOP). C/EBPβ is itself composed of several variants due to use of alternative translation start sites, resulting in C/EBPβ1 (the full length protein, also called LAP*), C/EBPβ2 (LAP, shorter by 23 amino acids versus LAP*), and C/EBPβ-20 (LIP, which lacks the transactivation domain and is considered to be a dominant negative isoform).The expression of NOS2 has been shown to be regulated by the neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA), via activation of beta-adrenergic receptors and a resulting increase in cAMP levels [<21>-<23>]. Although the effect of NA occurs at the transcriptional level, it does not inhibit the activation of NFκB or its binding to DNA [<24>]. A 27 bp region of the NOS2 promoter containing an almost consensus (6/7 identities) CRE site and a consensus binding site for C/EBP was shown to be critical for inhibition by NA raising the possibility of regulation through these transcription factors [<25>].The activity of C/EBP family members, like many transcription factors and co-factors, is regulated by the protein Small Ubiquitin like Modifier (SUMO) [<26>-<29>]. The covalent binding of SUMO to acceptor sites on target proteins involves several steps starting with conversion of the precursor to mature SUMO by a C-terminal hydrolase (SENP) [<30>]. The SUMO Activating Enzyme (SAE) E1 transfers SUMO to conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc9) which then catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and the ε-amino group of a target lysine. The majority of target lysines are within SUMO consensus motifs, however proteins without such motifs can also be SUMOylated. SUMO E3 ligases (PIAS, RanBP2) increase the efficiency of the reaction possibly also facilitating SUMOylation of targets lacking the consensus motif. The proteases (SENP) involved in maturation are also responsible for the removal of SUMO from substrates [<31>-<33>].Recent reports implicating SUMOylation in regulation of inflammation [<34>-<36>] as well as NOS2 transcription [<37>] combined with our findings that effects of NA on NOS2 expression most likely involve C/EBPβ prompted us to investigate whether SUMO-1 is involved in regulation of NOS2 transcription through modification of C/EBPβ. In this study we show that the expression of SUMO-1 and two critical SUMOylation enzymes (collectively referred to here as SRGs for SUMO Related Genes) as well as C/EBPβ are regulated under pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions, and that these genes modulate NOS2 promoter activation. Our data further support that interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ occur at the NOS2 promoter and are important for modulating NOS2 transcription. Primary astrocytes were prepared from cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1 Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described [<1>]. After 2 weeks of growth in complete medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) the cultures consisted of 95–98% astrocytes. C6 rat glioma cells were grown in complete medium. Cell cultures at 80–90% confluency, were transferred to DMEM with 1% FBS and antibiotics and treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and/or NA (30 μM) for induction or modulation of NOS2. Luciferase activity assays, chromatin and protein immunoprecipitations, and mRNA analysis were conducted 4 hr after treatments.

PMC2667488_2,"Stable transfectants of NOS2 constructs in pGL3 vector were generated as previously described [<25>]  Transient transfections were conducted using Effectene reagent (QIAGEN) according to manufacturers instructions. The phRG-TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was co-transfected as an internal control reporter to experimental reporter constructs at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Luciferase activity in stably transfected cells was determined using Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in a microplate luminometer (Rosys-Anthos, Anthos, Durham, NC, USA). Luciferase activity in transiently transfected cells was determined using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a single sample luminometer (Femtomaster FB12, Zylux, Huntsville, AL). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were conducted according to a protocol developed at the University Health Network Microarray Centre , Toronto, Canada). Briefly, cells grown in 10 cm plates to 80–90% confluency were treated as described above, proteins were cross linked to DNA using 1% formaldehyde (37°C for 10 min), then cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris, pH 8. Chromatin was sheared by sonication on ice at setting 6 (Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for 20 s, 8× with 2 min intervals. Supernatants containing chromatin fragments (mostly 600 bp) were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal IgG2a (sc-7962 directed against C-terminus amino acids 199–345 of human C/EBPβ and which detects all C/EBPβ isoforms and to a lesser extent C/EBPα, δ, or ε, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); 0.5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal IgG (anti-GMP1, which recognizes the 17 kDa unconjugated SUMO-1 as well as SUMO-1 ligated to target proteins, Zymed, Invitrogen) or no antibody (control) overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with Protein A Sepharose beads in the presence of 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA as blocking agent. Precipitates were subjected to several washes and then protein-DNA complexes eluted from beads by incubation in 0.1 M NaHCO3 containing 1% SDS. DNA: protein cross-links were reversed by incubating samples at 65°C for 5 hr in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and 20 μg/ml RNAse A, proteins digested with proteinase K (0.3 mg/ml), and DNA recovered using QiaQuick (QIAGEN) PCR purification columns.

Astrocytes grown in 6 cm plates were treated as described above. Cells were lysed in β-glycerophosphate buffer containing 2% SDS as described [<38>]. Immunoprecipitations were conducted with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal IgG2a (sc-7962, Santa Cruz); after lysates were diluted 20× with lysis buffer without SDS. Precipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes.

Primary astrocytes on gelatin coated coverslips were co-transfected with YFP-SUMO-1 and CFP-C/EBPβ expression plasmids. 24 hr after transfection cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. FRET analysis was conducted using LSM510 Meta system (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Emission spectra were obtained from cells co-expressing YFP-SUMO-1 and CFP-C/EBPβ as three dimensional image stacks by laser scanning microscopy using non bleaching intensities of 458 nm for CFP and 514 nm for YFP. Reference spectra obtained from cells expressing only CFP-C/EBPβ or only YFP-SUMO-1 were used for separation of the emission spectra by linear un-mixing software of the LSM510 Meta system. In cells expressing both fluorophores the acceptor YFP-SUMO-1 was photobleached in defined regions of interest (ROIs) using 100% power of the 514 nm laser line and the lack of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to the acceptor in those regions was observed as an increase in the donor (CFP-C/EBPβ) fluorescence.

Treatment with LPS resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in Ubc9 and SENP1 mRNA levels, and an approximately 30% decrease in SUMO-1 mRNA levels compared to untreated (control) cells. The presence of NA altered the LPS effect on these enzymes and SUMO-1 to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of LPS on SENP1 was attenuated by approximately 50%, whereas the level of Ubc9 mRNA was restored back to untreated levels. NA not only reversed the LPS effect on SUMO-1 mRNA levels but caused an increase of approximately 20% (Figure <1A>). The inflammatory effect of LPS was verified by an increase in NOS2 mRNA (Figure <1B>). C/EBPβ mRNA levels were also increased by LPS, consistent with its involvement in inflammatory activation. As previously shown [<23>]," co-treatment with NA reduced the effect of LPS on NOS2 but had no effect on C/EBPβ mRNA levels (Figure <1B>).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC2667488_3,"During aging, a reduction in brain NA levels occurs, which could contribute to increased neurological damage [<40>]  Analysis of expression of SUMO-1 and the conjugating enzyme Ubc9 mRNA levels (Figure <2A>) revealed a significant age-dependent change in SUMO-1 and Ubc9 mRNA levels in the frontal cortex of wild type C57BL/6 mice between 3 and 15 months of age, with values at 15 months reduced about 70% compared to the values measured at 3 months. During this time, there was also a significant age-dependent change in C/EBPβ and NOS2 mRNA levels, with increases of 3- to 5-fold measured between 3 and 15 months of age (Figure <2B>) suggesting an age-dependent increase in overall inflammatory status. To determine if SUMOylation was involved in inflammatory activation, rat C6 glioma cells stably transfected with luciferase reporter constructs pNFκB (4 × NFκB binding-element) or pGL3-2.2 (containing the 2.2 κB NOS2 promoter sequence)were transiently transfected with SRG expression plasmids and the promoter activation by LPS was determined (Figure <3>). Over-expression of SUMO-1 diminished the LPS-dependent increase in activity of both constructs. Increasing Ubc9 levels did not affect pNFκB activity but decreased pGL3-2.2 activity. Similarly, over-expressing SUMO protease SENP1 did not affect pNFκB but diminished pGL3-2.2 activity. The involvement of C/EBPβ and SUMO-1 in NOS2 transcription was further investigated using ChIP assays to detect the association of these proteins with regions of the NOS2 promoter containing either the C/EBP-2 or the C/EBP-3 site (Figure <5A>). C/EBPβ was found associated with both the C/EBP-2 and C/EBP-3 sites under all conditions; however binding to C/EBP-2 was increased by treatment with LPS plus NA (Figure <5B>). SUMO-1 was detected at both sites, although a stronger signal was obtained with the fragment of the NOS2 promoter containing the C/EBP-3 site (Figure <5C>). Treatment with LPS reduced association of SUMO-1 with this site while addition of NA restored it (or prevented that loss). Re-precipitation of SUMO-1 interacting fragments with anti-C/EBPβ antibody showed that under all conditions, the C/EBP-3 site also interacted with C/EBPβ (Figure <5C>, bottom panel). In contrast there was little evidence for simultaneous association of both SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ at C/EBP-2 site. An interaction of SUMO-1 with C/EBPβ was confirmed by Western blots which showed that SUMO-1 co-immunoprecipitated with C/EBPβ (Figure <5D>), and this interaction was increased by the presence of NA. rhetorical Figure 5 Presence of C/EBPβ and SUMO-1 on the NOS2 promoter. Primary astrocytes were treated with nothing (C), LPS (L), or LPS+NA (LN) for 4 hours, then ChIP analysis conducted. (A) Two fragments of the rat NOS2 promoter containing the proximal C/EBP-2 (top) or C/EBP-3 (bottom) binding sites were amplified by PCR after immunoprecipitation using (B) anti-C/EBPβ antibody or (C) anti-SUMO-1 antibody alone or followed by anti-C/EBPβ antibody. The products were separated through 2% agarose gels and their accuracy was verified by comparison to input DNA (\in\""", 5% of total input). The images shown are inverted versions (Adobe Photoshop) of the original gel images and are representative of results obtained in 2 separate experiments. (D) Lysates of astrocytes treated as indicated above were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-C/EBPβ antibody and Western blot (W) of the samples was probed with anti-SUMO-1 antibody. The involvement of C/EBPβ and SUMO-1 in NOS2 transcription was further investigated using ChIP assays to detect the association of these proteins with regions of the NOS2 promoter containing either the C/EBP-2 or the C/EBP-3 site (Figure <5A>). C/EBPβ was found associated with both the C/EBP-2 and C/EBP-3 sites under all conditions; however binding to C/EBP-2 was increased by treatment with LPS plus NA (Figure <5B>). SUMO-1 was detected at both sites, although a stronger signal was obtained with the fragment of the NOS2 promoter containing the C/EBP-3 site (Figure <5C>). Treatment with LPS reduced association of SUMO-1 with this site while addition of NA restored it (or prevented that loss). Re-precipitation of SUMO-1 interacting fragments with anti-C/EBPβ antibody showed that under all conditions, the C/EBP-3 site also interacted with C/EBPβ (Figure <5C>, bottom panel). In contrast there was little evidence for simultaneous association of both SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ at C/EBP-2 site. An interaction of SUMO-1 with C/EBPβ was confirmed by Western blots which showed that SUMO-1 co-immunoprecipitated with C/EBPβ (Figure <5D>), and this interaction was increased by the presence of NA. The possibility that C/EBPβ can be SUMOylated in primary astrocytes was further tested using FRET analysis. Primary astrocytes were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding CFP-tagged C/EBPβ and YFP-tagged SUMO-1 (Figure <4A>), and FRET measured by the increase in donor fluorescence (CFP-C/EBPβ) after photobleaching of the acceptor molecule (YFP-SUMO-1) (Figure <4B>). Acceptor photobleaching of selective ROIs in cells expressing both fluorophores resulted in a significant increase of donor fluorescence (Figure <4C>), consistent with a close proximity of C/EBPβ and SUMO-1 since FRET can only occur between a donor and acceptor pair at distances less than 10 nm. In this study we demonstrate that SUMO-1 and the enzymes Ubc9 and SENP1 of the SUMOylation process are expressed in primary astrocytes and that their expression is modified under inflammatory conditions. We also show that over-expressing these proteins modifies the astrocyte response to LPS, demonstrating a functional role for SUMOylation in astrocytes. To our knowledge this is the first report to characterize SUMO-1 and SRGs in astrocytes, confirming the existence and functionality of this important signaling pathway in one of the most abundant cell types in brain.Our data shows that pro-inflammatory conditions that are induced by LPS or during normal aging, and as evidenced by a significant increase in the expression of NOS2 as well as C/EBPβ, decrease the expression levels of SUMO-1, Ubc9 and the protease SENP1, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for SUMO-1 in brain. Although a decrease in SENP1 expression might be expected to promote inflammation (by reducing overall SUMOylation status), this enzyme is also involved in SUMO-1 maturation [<41>]. The fact that NA, an anti-inflammatory neurotransmitter, attenuates the effects of LPS on both the SRGs and NOS2 further supports an anti-inflammatory role of SUMO-1, and suggests that SUMOylation contributes to NA effects. Reduction in NA levels that occur during aging [<40>] could therefore contribute to the age-dependent decrease in SRGs.In our experiments NOS2 promoter activity was decreased when SUMO-1, Ubc9, or SENP1 were over-expressed (Figure <3>), suggesting an inhibitory role in primary astrocytes. SUMO-1 over-expression also decreased the activity of a pNFκB reporter plasmid that can only bind NFκB, which itself is not a SUMO target, therefore implying modulation of NFκB activity through interaction with other factors such as NEMO, IKK, or the inhibitory IκBα protein. Since NA increases both SRGs as well as IκBα [<25>], this raises the possibility that SUMOylation of IκBα contributes to the inhibitory effects of NA. However, the fact that over-expression of Ubc9 or SENP1 did not affect pNFκB activity suggests that their ability to inhibit NOS2 involves SUMOylation of proteins other than NFκB-related molecules.The increase we observed in C/EBPβ mRNA levels caused by inflammatory stimuli are in accordance with previous studies [<42>-<44>]. Interestingly, and as we have shown before for the activation of NFκB [<25>], NA did not affect C/EBPβ mRNA levels although it reduced NOS2 mRNA. Several reports have shown that C/EBPβ activity is controlled by modulating its binding to DNA [<45>] and in many cell types NFκB and C/EBPβ co-operate in regulating NOS2 transcription [<46>,"<47>]. This suggests that NA could inhibit NOS2 activation by altering the interaction of C/EBPβ with DNA and/or NFκB."""
PMC2667488_4,"Although some reports suggest that other C/EBPs can be involved in the regulation of NOS2 expression [<17>,<48>] in this paper we have focused attention on the C/EBPβ isoform since in most studies NOS2 transcription has been shown to involve C/EBPβ  In rat C6 glioma cells, NOS2 induction by over-expression of MAPKs was blocked by a dominant negative form of C/EBPβ [<49>]. In human astrocytes, activation by the HIV-1 tat protein induced C/EBPβ expression and a dominant negative C/EBPβ blocked NO production [<50>]. In smooth muscle cells induction of NOS2 was accompanied by binding of C/EBPβ to the promoter [<51>], and in kidney cells, supershift assays revealed only the presence of C/EBPβ on the NOS2 promoter, when induced by LPS and IFNγ [<52>]. In liver cells, overexpression of the C/EBPβ-20 inhibitor LIP suppressed activity of the human NOS2 promoter [<18>]. Other inhibitors have also been shown to reduce NOS2 expression associated with a decrease in C/EBPβ levels or binding to the promoter [<15>,<53>,<54>].Although several roles for SUMOylation in brain have been reported, there are limited studies describing the ability of SUMOylation to regulate brain inflammation. SUMOylation can have pro- or anti-inflammatory actions, depending on the specific SUMO isoform that is conjugated and the target protein. SUMO-1 levels were shown to be low in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD) samples [<55>]; while SUMO-2/3 was detected at high levels in cortex after cerebral ischemia [<38>]. Transfection studies have shown that SUMOylation of amyloid precursor protein reduced Aβ production in human neurons [<56>] and in HeLA cells [<57>]; and that SUMO-1 modification increases human superoxide-dismutase-1 stability and aggregation [<58>]. The protein IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase type 1) which transduces IL1 signaling and immune responses of Toll-like receptors is SUMOylated in brain, which could influence its ability to modulate inflammation [<59>].SUMOylation is known to modulate transcription factor: DNA interactions [<60>,<61>] and in many cases has been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses [<35>,<36>,<62>]. SUMOylation of JunB modifies its ability to induce cytokine expression [<63>], SUMOylation of PPARγ increases it's interactions with the NCoR co-repressor and prevents inflammatory responses [<37>], SUMO-1 can modify several members of the NFκB signaling pathway, including NEMO (NFκB essential modulator) necessary for NFκB activation [<64>], as well as the inhibitory IκBα protein [<34>,<65>] and its kinase IKK [<66>]; and SUMOylation of STAT1 reduces IFN-dependent, STAT1 mediated transcription [<67>]. SUMOylation of C/EBPs has been shown to modulate transcription [<26>-<29>,<68>,<69>], and in many cases associated with reduced activity. An increase in SUMOylated C/EBPβ was shown to be involved in reduction of COX2 expression [<70>], and SUMOylation of C/EBPβ reduces albumin transcription [<68>]. Similarly, the synergic control elements of C/EBPα are believed to require SUMOylation for activity [<29>]. We therefore we considered the possibility that NA altered CEBP/β activity through SUMOylation.There are several binding sites for members of C/EBP family on the rat NOS2 promoter, two of which are located close to the proximal NFκB binding site (C/EBP-2, located upstream; C/EBP-3, located downstream). ChIP results show that LPS treatment is associated with decreased levels of SUMO-1 associated with C/EBP-3; and that NA restores those levels (or prevents the LPS-induced loss). This suggests that SUMO-1 at this site exerts suppressive effects. We observed that C/EBPβ was bound to both site-2 and site-3, and was not significantly modified by LPS; however in the presence of NA there was a clear increase in C/EBPβ at site-2. Although C/EBPβ is generally considered to be pro-inflammatory, as indicated above there are also studies showing that it can suppress transcription. C/EBPβ represses activation of the cyclin D promoter [<26>]; and activation of c-Myc expression in Tcells [<27>].Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments showing both C/EBPβ and SUMO-1 interacting at the C/EBP-3 site suggest that the SUMOylated factor at this site may be C/EBPβ. The results of Western blots and FRET analysis indicate strongly that C/EBPβ is SUMOylated however these results may also indicate the presence of a complex containing both C/EBPβ and SUMOylated factor(s). Thus, we conclude that the suppressive effects of NA on NOS2 expression involve increased SUMOylation at the NOS2 promoter.Since in this paper we have focused attention on modification of C/EBPβ by SUMO-1, our results do not address the possibility that inflammatory stimuli or NA modify SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 interactions with the NOS2 promoter or with C/EBPβ, as recently reported to occur in COS1 cells [<26>]. Furthermore, in these studies we used an antibody directed against the amino terminus of C/EBPβ which does not distinguish between C/EBPβ isoforms; however findings that C/EBPβ1 is a preferential target for SUMOylation [<26>] suggests that our results may primarily reflect SUMOylation of this isoform. Our results demonstrate an important role for SUMOylation in regulating NOS2 expression in astrocytes, and point to modification of C/EBPβ as a critical determinant. However, there are likely to be other SUMO targets involved in the regulation of NOS2 transcription which may also contribute to suppressive effects of NA which need to be characterized. In view of the known involvement of NOS2 in a variety of neurological diseases and conditions, the knowledge that increasing SUMOylation processes can reduce NOS2 expression provides novel targets for therapeutic interventions.

In astrocytes, the inflammatory induction of Nitric Oxide Synthase type 2 (NOS2) is inhibited by noradrenaline (NA) at the transcriptional level however its effects on specific transcription factors are not fully known. Recent studies show that the activity of several transcription factors including C/EBPβ, which is needed for maximal NOS2 expression, is modulated by conjugation of the small molecular weight protein SUMO. We examined whether the expression of SUMO Related Genes (SRGs: SUMO-1, the conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and the protease SENP1) are affected by inflammatory conditions or NA and whether SUMO-1 regulates NOS2 through interaction with C/EBPβ. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammatory responses including NOS2 expression in primary astrocytes. The mRNA levels of SRGs were determined by QPCR. A functional role for SUMOylation was evaluated by determining effects of over-expressing SRGs on NOS2 promoter and NFκB binding-element reporter constructs. Interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ with the NOS2 promoter were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interactions of SUMO-1 with C/EBPβ were examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. LPS decreased mRNA levels of SUMO-1, Ubc9 and SENP1 in primary astrocytes and a similar decrease occurred during normal aging in brain. NA attenuated the LPS-induced reductions and increased SUMO-1 above basal levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC2667488_5,"Over-expression of SUMO-1, Ubc9, or SENP1 reduced the activation of a NOS2 promoter, whereas activation of a 4 × NFκB binding-element reporter was only reduced by SUMO-1  ChIP studies revealed interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPβ with C/EBP binding sites on the NOS2 promoter that were modulated by LPS and NA. SUMO-1 co-precipitated with C/EBPβ and a close proximity was confirmed by FRET analysis. Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates NOS2 expression in astrocytes, and point to modification of C/EBPβ as a possible mechanism of action. Targeting the SUMOylation pathway may therefore offer a novel means to regulate inflammatory NOS2 expression in neurological conditions and diseases. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3514650_0,"Conditional overexpression of four-repeat human tau containing the P301L missense mutation in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy leads to progressive accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and hyperphosphorylated, sarkosyl-insoluble tau species, which are biochemically comparable to abnormal tau characteristic of hereditary tauopathies termed FTDP-17. To fully understand the impact of tau species at different stages of self-assembly on neurodegeneration, we fractionated rTg4510 brain representing several stages of tauopathy to obtain TBS-extractable (S1), high salt/sarkosyl-extractable (S3), and sarkosyl-insoluble (P3) fractions. Under reducing condition, the S1 fraction was demonstrated by Western blotting to contain both 50–60 kDa normally-sized and 64 kDa tau. Both are thermo-stable, but the 64 kDa tau showed a higher degree of phosphorylation. Under non-reducing condition, nearly all TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau were detected as ~130 kDa species consistent with the size of dimer. Quantitative analysis showed ~80 times more 64 kDa tau in S1 than P3 fraction. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed tau-positive granules/short filaments in S1 fraction. These structures displayed MC1 immunoreactivities indicative of conformational/pathological change of tau. MC1 immunoreactivity was detected by dot blotting in samples from 2.5 month-old mice, whereas Ab39 immunoreactivity indicative of late stages of tau assembly was detected only in P3 fraction. Quantitative analysis also demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between brain weight and 64 kDa tau, but the level of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau reflects neurodegeneration better than that of sarkosyl-insoluble 64 kDa tau. Together, the findings suggest that TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau production is a potential target for therapeutic intervention of tauopathies. The authors thank Dr. L.I.

Lundbeck A/S (C.V., J.T.P., J.L.) and Mayo Foundation (J.L.). Accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of microtubule-associated protein tau is a major hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related diseases regarded as tauopathies [<1>–<3>]. Tau protein derived from NFTs is insoluble in the detergent sarkosyl and has elevated levels of both phosphorylation and ubiquitination - features that distinguish NFTs from normal tau protein. In human tauopathies, accumulation of fibrillary tau and neuronal loss have been localized in brain regions associated with cognitive dysfunction [<4>], suggesting a close link between these features. This notion is supported by studies of transgenic animals overexpressing human tau (hTau) [<5>–<12>]. The rTg4510 mouse model expresses mutant hTau containing the frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to tau on chromosome 17 (FTDP-17-Tau) associated P301L mutation and hTau expression can be by suppressed doxycycline [<13>,<14>]. In rTg4510 mice, expression of P301L hTau induces NFT formation, neuronal loss and behavioral abnormalities (e.g. memory dysfunction) in an age-dependent manner. Importantly, changes in memory index have been noted in rTg4510 prior to the appearance of sarkosyl-insoluble tau, suggesting a poor relationship between sarkosyl-insoluble tau production and memory impairment [<15>]. Furthermore, suppression of hTau halted neuronal loss and partially reversed cognitive dysfunction without preventing NFTs [<14>], suggesting that NFTs themselves are not initially cytotoxic. Thus, the initial mechanisms that lead to neuronal death and memory impairment in these mice remain unclear.Studies of brain specimens from individuals with AD indicate that the progression of tauopathy is likely to involve different pools of tau [<16>]. A pool of hyperphosphorylated tau—referred to as AD-P tau— previously has been isolated from AD brains through differential centrifugation [<16>]. This form of tau was recovered from a pellet fraction (27,000 × g to 200,000 × g) from AD brains homogenized in a buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose [<16>]. AD-P tau does not appear to associate with any filamentous elements, yet it is able to self-assemble into filaments comparable to those that accumulate in AD brains [<17>]. Furthermore, two additional pools of hyperphosphorylated abnormal tau have been identified based on their solubility in sarkosyl [<18>].Due to the rapid progression of tau pathology in specific brain regions and the conditional expression of tau, the rTg4510 mouse model has proven to be a useful tool for investigating the progression of tauopathy. These mice produce 140 and 170 kDa abnormal tau species, the level of which is significantly and negatively correlated to the memory index of the mice [<15>]. The 140 kDa tau and normal tau are similar in solubility, and both can be recovered in the supernatant fraction obtained by centrifuging brain extracts at 150,000 × g for 15 min. In comparison, the 170 kDa species is primarily sarkosyl-insoluble. Both 140 and 170 kDa tau represent a very small proportion of total tau in rTg4510 mice; however, they have been considered as tau species at early-stages of aggregation [<15>]. Regardless, it remains unclear as to changes of different tau pools during the progression of tauopathy. To address these issues, we examined the profile and solubility of tau protein using specimens derived from 2 to 14 month-old rTg4510 mice and characterized a pool of TBS-extractable tau in depth. The parental mutant hTau responder line, parental tTAactivator line, and the resultant F1 rTg4510 mice and littermates were generated and maintained as previously described by SantaCruz et al. [<14>]. Mice were maintained on a standard diet lacking doxycycline to ensure that transgenic hTau was expressed throughout the lifetime of the experimental animals. JNPL3 mouse line was maintained as hemizygotes on an outbred Swiss Webster background [<19>]. All procedures involving mice and their care were approved by the Mayo Clinic and University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation in order to preserve the metabolic environment of the brain and to prevent artifacts that could alter the biochemical profiles of tau. Mouse brains were bisected down the midline to yield two hemispheres. The cerebral cortex and hippocampus (ctx+hip) of the right hemisphere of each animal were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use. Tissues were then homogenized in 10 volumes of Tris-buffered saline [TBS: 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I & II (Sigma), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] [<14>,<15>]. The homogenates were either centrifuged at 150,000 × g (protocol A) or 27,000 × g (protocol B) for 20 min at 4°C to obtain supernatant (S1) and pellet fractions (<Figs. 1A, B>). Pellets were homogenized in 5 volumes of high salt/sucrose buffer [0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose, 10 mM Tris/HCl, (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF] and centrifuged as above. The supernatants were collected and incubated with sarkosyl (1% final concentration; Sigma) for one hour at 37°C, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for one hour at 4°C to obtain salt and sarkosyl-extractable (S3) and sarkosyl-insoluble (P3) fractions. The P3 pellet was re-suspended in TE buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA] to a volume equivalent to half of that of the brain specimens used to produce brain homogenates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3514650_1,"To prepare heat-stable samples, we incubated a portion of the S1 fraction at 95°C for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min  The supernatants were concentrated by using a centrifugal filter (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, MA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated protein bands were visualized through CBB staining using a SimpleBlue™ SafeStain kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Human temporal cortices were provided by the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville brain bank for neurodegenerative disorders. Tissue extraction was followed by protocol B as shown above. The experimental procedure involving human tissues was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board. Fractionated tissue extracts were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (2.5%). The heat-treated samples (60°C for 15 min) were separated by gel electrophoresis on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels or 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels containing a 15-well comb (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). For dot blotting, samples were pre-treated by Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) to absorb mouse IgG background. 20 μl of Dynabeads were washed with PBS and mixed with 200 μl of S1 fraction. The mixture was incubated on a rotator overnight at 4°C. 1 μl of each immune-depressed sample was spotted on nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with a blocking solution containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Triton-X100 in TBS, the membranes were incubated with various antibodies, washed to remove excess antibodies, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Bound antibodies were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL PLUS kit; PerkinElmer). Western blot immunoreactivity was visualized by a computer-linked LAS-4000 BioImaging Analyzer System (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and quantitative analysis was performed by Multi Gauge v3.1 software (Fujifilm). To detect tau protein, we subjected different fractions (S1, S3, P1) derived from 0.01 mg of tissue to SDS-PAGE. For comparing different fractions, we loaded S1, S3, and P3 fractions into gels at a ratio of 1:16:50 (based on tissue weight). To quantitate tau protein and to compare tau protein levels across individual mouse brains, we determined the relative amounts of tau in S1 by normalizing tau protein levels by those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH). For the inter-gel standard, three mouse brain samples were selected and loaded into each gel. Then, the averaged relative amount of these samples was used for the correction between multiple blot intensities. We used polyclonal tau antibodies E1, WKS44, and WKS46 [<20>]; pS212 (Invitrogen); and pS422 (Invitrogen); and monoclonal tau antibodies PHF1, CP13, and MC1 (provided by Dr. Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine); Ab39 [<21>,<22>]; Tau5 (provided by Dr. Lester I. Binder, Northwestern University Medical School); Tau13 (Covance, Emeryville, CA); 12E8 (provided by Dr. Peter Seubert, Elan Pharmaceuticals); PHF6 (AbCam); and Tau46 (Zymed). Of the aforementioned antibodies, PHF1, PHF6, CP13, 12E8, pS212, and pS422 recognize phosphorylated epitopes. The remaining antibodies recognize non-phosphorylated epitopes. The location of epitopes recognized by different antibodies is listed in <Supplemental Table 1>. Other monoclonal antibodies used were specific to GAPDH (Biodesign, Saco, ME); β-actin; or β-tubulin (Sigma). S1 fraction samples were prepared in rehydration solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and IPG buffer using 2-D Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare Life Science, Piscataway, NJ). They were loaded onto 11 cm IPG strips (pH 4–7 or pH 3–10; GE Healthcare Life Science), followed by isoelectric focusing. Second dimension separation was performed with 10% SDS-PAGE at 150 V using the Criterion™ gel electrophoresis system (BioRad Laboratories). Subsequently, gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad Laboratories) for Western blotting using tau antibodies WKS44 and PHF1. Samples were adsorbed onto carbon/formvar-coated 400 mesh copper grids (EM Science, Fort Washington, PA) for 60 sec. After washing with filtered TBS three times, the grids were blocked for 15 min in blocking solution (filtered TBS containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin and 2% horse serum), and then incubated for 2 hours with Tau46 (1:50) and E1 (1:20) antibodies. Excess antibodies were removed by washing with the blocking solution three times. The grids were subsequently incubated for 1 hour in 5 nm gold-conjugated anti-rabbit and 10 nm gold-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:20; GE Healthcare Life Science). After washing with TBS five times, the grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 45 sec and examined with a Philips 208S electron microscope (Philips, Hillsboro, OR). All antibodies were diluted with the blocking solution. Statistical analysis was conducted using PRISM4 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and one-way ANOVA, unless noted otherwise. In previous studies of rTg4510 mice [<14>,<23>], brain homogenates were centrifuged at 150,000 × g (protocol A) to yield supernatant and pellet fractions (<Fig. 1A>). The pellet was subsequently treated with high salt/sucrose buffer and centrifuged as above. The supernatants were treated with sarkosyl and separated into sarkosyl-extractable and sarkosyl-insoluble fractions. In the present study, we followed a different protocol (protocol B), in which tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g. This protocol has previously been used to study abnormal tau from AD brains (<Fig. 1A>) [<24>]. Regardless of the protocols, supernatant fractions obtained from the first centrifugation step (S1 fraction) of brain and spinal cord preparations from aged rTg4510 tau transgenic mice contain tau proteins of size [50–60 kDa; consistent with that of normal tau (<Fig. 1B>)], as determined by immunoblotting. Larger sized tau of 64 kDa in molecular weight, referred to as TBS-extractable 64 kDa, was recovered only in the S1 fraction following protocol B in aged rTg4510 transgenic mice (<Fig. 1B>). Such tau species, detected in brain specimen from rTg4510 mice were not found in spinal cord – a region that displayed no tauopathy (<Fig. 1B>)[<14>]. TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau was also demonstrated in the S1 fraction from the aged constitutive transgenic model, JNPL3, in which the same 0N4R human P301L tau is overexpressed as in rTg4510 mice, but at lower levels and in an altered expression pattern [<5>]. We analyzed brain and spinal cord extracts derived from a female 16 month-old JNPL3 mouse which displayed hind limb paralysis, a phenotype that we have previously shown correlates with degree of tauopathy in the spinal cord of this model [<19>]. Similar to brain extracts from rTg4510 mice, brain extracts from JNPL3 mice also contained the TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau, though at a lesser extent. The preponderance of this TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau in JNPL3 mice was observed in the spinal cord, which is a main site of tauopathy in this model (<Fig. 1B and C>).To further confirm the existence of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau in S1 fraction recovered by low speed centrifugation (27,000 × g, protocol B in <Fig. 1A and B>), we analyzed rTg4510 mice ranging from 2 month to 14 months, time points that cover the progression from early to severe tauopathy in this model. 64 kDa tau was detected in the S1 fraction from rTg4510 brain samples from 4 months of age onward and in the P3 fraction at all ages examined by probing with antibodies specific to hTau (E1) and phospho-tau (PHF1) (<Fig. 1C>). The amount of sarkosyl-insoluble tau was more abundant in 8 than 4 or 2 month-old rTg4510 mice (<Fig. 1C>). 64 kDa tau was rarely detected in sarkosyl-soluble (S3) fraction from rTg4510 mouse brains with E1 and PHF-1 antibodies. Similar to what was observed in rTg4510 mice, the S1 and P3 fractions from brain and spinal cords of aged JNPL3 mice with hind-limb paralysis contained 64 kDa tau immunoreactive with E1 and PHF1 antibodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3514650_2,"In contrast to rTg4510, the S3 fraction from JNPL3 specimens (particularly those derived from the spinal cord of mice with a more severe motor phenotype) contained appreciable levels of 64 kDa tau (<Fig  1C>) that was both immunopositive for E1 and PHF1. It has been noted that P3 fraction contains filamentous tau aggregates among other elements and that enrichment of tau filaments as precipitates can be achieved via further centrifugation (150, 000 × g for 1 hour) through a sucrose density gradient [<18>,<25>]. Therefore, it is possible that 64 kDa tau in S1 and S3 fractions were constituents of tau assemblies at earlier stages of tau-self interactions. To determine the relative amounts of hTau in different fractionations derived from rTg4510 mice, we performed quantitative analysis of E1 antibody immunoblotting of samples from 3 to 4 and 6 to 8 month-old animals according to protocol B. Upon correction for differences in sample dilution, we determined the proportion of total human tau (i.e. S1+S3+P3) in different fractions. As summarized in <Fig. 1D>, more than 93% of tau was recovered in the S1 fraction, followed by S3 and P3 fractions, which represent less than 6.3% and 0.5% of the total, respectively. The proportion of tau in P3 fractions increased with age of animals (6–8 versus 3–4 month-old). Of those partitioned into S1 fraction of the brain, only ~3% was due to the presence of 64 kDa tau species in rTg4510 mice between 3 and 4 months of age, though this increased to ~14% in 6 to 8 month-old rTg4510 mice. Our quantitative analysis also showed the presence of about 78–80 times more 64 kDa tau in the S1 than in the P3 fraction (<Fig. 1D>).We next carried out detailed analyses of tau in 1 to 14 month-old rTg4510 mice, focusing on the S1 and P3 fractions, since the S3 fraction did not contain abnormal sized tau. To analyze the progression of tau phosphorylation, blotting was performed with PHF1 antibody (<Fig. 2A>), which was widely used for the detection of hyperphosphorylated tau [<26>,<27>]. In addition to the aforementioned 64 kDa tau species, larger sized tau species were present in samples from 4 months and older mice and more abundant in older ones (<Fig. 2A>). In the S1 fraction, most large tau species were discerned as discrete bands upon immunoblotting. In contrast, most large tau in the P3 fraction appeared as smears displaying wide ranges of electrophoretic mobility (<Fig. 2A>; bottom panel). A portion of high molecular weight (HMW) tau in the P3 fraction from rTg4510 brain (indicated arrows in <Fig. 2A>) was too large to enter the gel, and the amount of HMW tau in the P3 increased with age and severity of tauopathy in rTg4510 mice. The results raise the possibility that 64 kDa tau species partitioned to the S1 fraction were at earlier states of self-assembly and/or less modified than those located in the P3 fraction. Upon quantitative analysis of 64 kDa tau in the S1 fraction versus brain weight, we demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between these two parameters (<Fig. 2B, D>), regardless whether animals of all ages, 1 to 8 month-old or 14 month-old were considered. In this regard, it has been reported that tauopathy causes progressive, age-dependent forebrain atrophy in rTg4510 mice [<14>,<28>]. Similar analysis showed a significant inverse relationship between the levels of 64 kDa in the P3 fraction and brain weight, when mice of all ages or 8 month-old or younger were examined (<Fig. 2C, D>). However, for 1 to 6 month-old mice the relationship between sarkosyl-insoluble 64 kDa tau and brain weight is not as well correlated as that displayed by the TBS-extractable tau and brain weight (i.e. p=0.1003 versus p=0.0018) (<Fig. 2D>). In addition, dot blot analysis of the P3 fraction showed an age-dependent increase of PHF1-immunoreactivity until 6 months of age. However, the inverse correlation between the total amount of sarkosyl-insoluble tau and brain weight disappeared in mice over 6 months of age (data not shown). These results suggest that the level of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau species appears to reflect neuronal loss better than that of sarkosyl-insoluble tau species. To analyze tau phosphorylation, we probed blots of S1 fractions derived from brain extracts from 4 and 8 month-old rTg4510 mice with a panel of tau antibodies against phosphorylation-dependent or phosphorylation-independent tau epitopes (<Fig. 3A>). TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau (indicated by arrows on right side of blots in <Fig. 3A>) was readily detected by nine phosphorylation-dependent antibodies tested (AT270, CP13, pS212, AT100, PHF6, 12E8, PHF1, pS400, and pS422). By contrast, some of these phosphorylated epitopes were hardly detected in normal tau (indicated by bold lines on right side of blots in <Fig. 3A>), even though the level of normal tau is much higher than that of 64 kDa tau according to immunolabeling with phosphorylation-independent tau antibodies (E1, WKS44, and Tau46). The results support the notion that TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau differs from normal tau in the extent of phosphorylation and is phosphorylated at multiple sites.To evaluate tau phosphorylation during the progression of tauopathy in this model, we probed Western blots of S1 fraction with 12E8, PHF1 and E1 antibodies and performed quantitative analysis (<Fig. 3B>). The ratios of phosphorylated tau to total tau (50–64 kDa) (e.g., 12E8 versus E1, respectively) were determined and values derived from samples of 2 month-old mice were regarded as one. As summarized in <Fig. 3C>, the proportion of phosphorylated tau increased as the age of mice increased. The extent of tau phosphorylation in 8 month-old mice is as high as sevenfold (<Fig. 3C>) of that from 2 month-old.Besides immunoblotting with phosphorylation-dependent antibodies, we used 2D SDS-PAGE at pH 3–10 and pH 4–7 to profile tau phosphorylation in the S1 fraction of rTg4510 mouse brain at 6 months. After 2D electrophoresis was completed, proteins in polyacrylamide gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blotted by phosphorylation-independent tau antibody WKS44. As a result, 2D SDS-PAGE/Western blot (2D-Western blot) analysis of S1 fraction from 6 month-old rTg4510 mice revealed multiple 64 kDa tau isoforms having isoelectric points ranging from pH 5.0 to pH 6.0 (validated by control proteins β-tubulin and β-actin as shown in <Fig. 3E>), values that are far more acidic than the theoretical isoelectric point (pH 9.4) of the 4R0N tau isoform, which contains the P301L mutation (<Fig. 3D & E>). 2D-Western blot by using PHF1 antibody confirmed that hyperphosphorylated 64 kDa tau was displayed to multiple spots (<Fig. 3D>). These data support further that 64 kDa tau is modified by phosphorylation. Interestingly, it should be noted that multiple spots of 64 kDa tau were migrated to the same position on the second dimension of electrophoresis (shown in <Fig. 3E>) indicating that the mobility shift of the 64 kDa tau was not entirely dependent on increased molecular weight by additional phosphorylation. To find out whether normal and TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau have different physicochemical properties, the S1 fraction from 6 month-old rTg4510 mice was centrifuged further at 150,000×g for 20 min to obtain a supernatant (S1c) and a pellet (S1p) fraction (<Fig. 4A>). When the S1p fraction was analyzed under reducing (+β-mercaptoethanol [βME], <Fig. 4B>) and non-reducing conditions, most of the tau was detected in the region around 64 kDa (arrow in <Fig. 4A>) and ~ 130 kDa (dimer in <Fig. 4B>), respectively. In comparison, the electrophoretic mobility of most tau in S1c is comparable to normal tau and was not affected by the presence or absence of reducing agent βME (<Fig. 4B>). The results indicate the presence of tau assemblies in S1p preparation and the involvement of disulfide bond cross-linkage in tau-self interaction, and are consistent with previous findings of cysteine-dependent tau dimers [<29>,<30>].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3514650_3,"To test whether TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau is comparable to normal tau in terms of thermo-stability, the S1c and S1p fractions were heat-treated at 95°C for 10 min, and centrifuged to separate heat-stable from heat-unstable proteins  Similar preparations from non-transgenic mice were used as controls and 4R0N recombinant tau was included as a reference. All heat-treated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie blue or probed with E1 and PHF1 antibodies by Western blotting (<Supplemental Fig. 1>). Coomassie blue staining showed the presence far more 50–60 kDa (marked by bracket) and 64 kDa (marked by arrow) proteins in rTg4510 than non-transgenic preparations, when samples from S1c and S1p fractions, respectively, were analyzed (<Supplemental Fig. 1>). Importantly, these sized proteins displayed E1 and PHF1 immunoreactivities, indicating that TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau is as thermo-stable as normal tau (<Supplemental Fig. 1>). To determine the morphological properties of tau assemblies located in the S1p fraction, we used electron microscopy with or without immunogold labeling. Numerous granular aggregates and short filaments (~200 nm in length and 10–17 nm in width) were detected in S1p samples derived from 6-month-old rTg4510 mice (<Fig. 4, C and E>). Structures were rarely detected in corresponding preparation from 6 month-old non-transgenic controls (<Fig. 4D>). By counting the number of granules and filaments in multiple fields (9 fields, 1.8 μm × 1.8 μm), we estimated that granular elements represent about 30% of the total (n=5.4±1.1 in an area of 3.24 μm2) and the rest were short filaments (n=13.9±1.1 in an area of 3.24 μm2).Immunogold labeling of S1p samples revealed tau immunoreactivities in granular and short filamentous structures (<Fig. 4, G and H>). Since the P3 fraction contained 64 kDa tau species and has previously been shown to contain filamentous elements, we determined whether there are dimensional differences between such filaments and those recovered in the S1p fraction. Conventional transmission electron microscopic analysis of samples revealed the presence of filaments that were much longer in the P3 than those in S1p fraction (<Fig. 4, E and F>). The results as well as those obtained from biochemical profiling of tau are consistent with the notion that the S1p fraction contains tau at earlier stages of assembly than P3. To determine the relevance of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau to human tauopathy, we fractionated human brain homogenates from FTDP-17 harboring P301L mutation, using protocol B and centrifugation of the S1 fraction at 150,000×g to derive S1c and S1p fractions. Because the level of hTau in rTg4510 mouse brain is significantly higher than that in human brain, we loaded 20-fold more FTDP-17 human brain sample so that the Western blots would show comparable intensities. As the sample loading ratio of human brain samples was different from the rTg4510 mouse brain samples, the intensity of S3 fractions from human brain samples was much less than that from rTg4510 mouse brain samples (<Supplemental Fig. 2>). Similar to what was observed in rTg4510 mice, S1p and P3 fractions from human specimens contained higher molecular weight, phosphorylated tau species (e.g. 12E8 and PHF1 immunoreactive) larger than normal tau (<Supplemental Fig. 2> and <Fig. 4A>) - some did not enter the gel and others appeared as smears. The electrophoretic profiles of tau in samples derived from human FTDP-17 brain are more complex than those in corresponding preparations from rTg4510 mice. In the P3 fraction, three distinctive tau species of size 60, 64 and 68 kDa were detected in samples from human as previously reported [<18>,<31>], but only 64 kDa tau was found in those from transgenic mice. The difference between human FTDP-17 and rTg4510 samples likely reflects the presence of multiple human tau isoforms in human brain rather than the single 0N4R human tau isoform found in the rTg4510 model. The human FTDP-17 samples contained a number of lower molecular weight products which were absent in the rTg4510 samples, and this may reflect degradation that is associated with post-mortem delay associated with human studies. To confirm early pathological alteration of 64 kDa tau species, both S1c and S1p fractions were examined for the immunoreactivity of MC1, Ab39 and Tau13 antibodies (<Fig. 5>). The MC1 antibody recognized specific tau conformation in which the amino-terminal region comes into contact with the microtubule-binding domains [<32>]. The conformational change from normal unfolded state to this compact folding state has been considered to be essential for tau aggregation process [<27>,<33>]. The Ab39 antibody is known to recognize a unique epitope in NFT although its precise epitope is still unknown due to difficulties associated with its use for Western blotting analysis [<22>,<34>]. Tau13 antibody is hTau specific and phosphorylation-independent monoclonal antibody. Our dot blotting data clearly showed that MC1-immunoreactivity in S1p fraction from rTg4510 mice was significantly higher than that in S1p fraction from non-tg mice at both 2.5 and 8 months of age (<Fig. 5B>). Based on pathological alteration of tau in rTg4510 mice, it was reasonable that the P3 fraction from 8 month-old rTg4510 mice showed higher MC1-immunoreactivity than the P3 fraction from 2.5 month-old rTg4510 mice (<Fig. 5B>). On the other hand, Ab39-immunoreactivities in both S1c and S1p fractions from rTg4510 mice were not significantly different from those from non-tg mice (<Fig. 5C>) while Tau13-immunoreactivities in those fractions from rTg4510 were clearly positive to compare with those from non-tg mice (<Fig. 5D>). As the Ab39 antibody preferentially detects NFT in tauopathy brains [<19>,<22>,<34>], Ab39-immunoreactivity was only positive in P3 fraction from 8 month-old rTg4510 mice (<Fig. 5C>). Similar to the MC1 antibody, Tau13-immunoreactivity in P3 fraction from 8 month-old rTg4510 mice was higher than that in P3 fraction from 2.5 month-old rTg4510 mice (<Fig. 5D>). These data suggest that TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau has a MC1-positive conformation, and differs from mature tangles. Findings of tau mutations in frontotemporal dementia affected subjects and mutant tau expression causing formation of tau-positive inclusions, neuronal loss and behavior abnormalities in various animal models have established a role of this protein in neurodegeneration [<5>–<12>]. The abundance of NFTs has been reported to correlate positively with the severity of cognitive impairment in AD [<35>]. However, accumulating evidences derived from studies of experimental models have indicated that NFTs may not be neurotoxic. For example, a Drosophila model of tauopathy showed neuronal cell loss without NFT formation [<36>] and suppression of hTau overexpression in a transgenic mouse model prevented further neuronal loss and cognitive impairment without decreasing NFT count [<14>]. These studies suggest that tau assemblies at certain stages of self-interactions before NFTs are formed may be involved in neuronal loss.To identify tau species related to the development of tauopathy and progression of neuronal dysfunction, we examined tau protein biochemistry in an inducible P301L mutant htau transgenic mouse model. As demonstrated in the present study, induced hTau expression caused an age-dependent increase of TBS-extractable tau of 64 kDa in molecular weight. This form of tau is larger than normal tau, recoverable in the supernatant (S1) fraction following centrifugation of brain homogenates at 27,000 × g, and separable from normal tau after further centrifugation at 150,000 × g, and abnormally phosphorylated. In the brains of FTDP-17 patients, hyperphosphorylated tau was also recovered in the fraction recovered following 27,000 × g to 150,000 × g centrifugation. Our results are in line with previous findings showing that AD P-tau is primarily isolated from the 27,000 × g to 200,000 × g fraction of AD brain extracts [<16>].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3514650_4,"Immunochemical and morphological analyses showed that less than 30% of tau in the AD P-tau fraction is derived from filamentous species [<16>]  Consistent with these observations, we did not find tau filaments (>200 nm length) in the TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau preparations. Instead, we observed amorphous, tau-immunopositive granular aggregates and short filaments. This morphological finding was further supported by MC1 immunoreactivity and Ab39 insensitivity. The MC1 antibody, which was raised to Alz50 [<37>] immunoaffinity purified paired helical filaments from AD brain [<32>], identifies an early pathogenic conformation of tau [<27>]. On the other hand, the Ab39 antibody raised to crude AD brain homogenate preferentially detects NFTs [<21>,<22>,<34>]. Our results indicate that the TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau-enriched fraction contains tau products with abnormal conformation at less advanced stages of self-assembly than NFTs. Interestingly, in brain samples from 6 month-old rTg4510 mice, there was ~80 times more 64 kDa tau in the TBS-extractable fraction than in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, indicating that more than 95% of 64 kDa tau may comprise soluble tau species. In Western blots, sarkosyl-insoluble tau from human tauopathy brains appears high molecular weight smears (see <Supplemental Fig. 2> and [<24>,<38>,<39>]). Although these high molecular smear species can be accounted as a major pool of hyperphosphorylated tau from human diseased brain, the 64 kDa tau in the TBS-extractable fraction from rTg4510 mice was more abundant than htau immunoreactive smear in sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from rTg4510 mice (see <Supplemental Fig. 2> and note that S1 and P3 fraction were derived from 0.01 and 0.5 mg of tissue, respectively). Therefore, it is possible that soluble hyperphosphorylated tau species, not NFTs, are involved in neuronal dysfunction.Our previous work that examined the tau aggregation pathway using an in vitro tau self-assembly system demonstrated the existence of tau aggregation intermediates (e.g., tau dimer, tau multimer, and granular tau oligomer) [<40>]. Tau multimers with apparent molecular weights of ~140 kDa and ~170 kDa have been reported in previous studies of rTg4510 brains, using a Tris-glycine gel system operating at pH 6.8 [<15>]. The 170 kDa tau was shown to display sarkosyl-insolubility whereas the 140 kDa species was extractable in TBS and recovered in supernatant after centrifugation at 150,000×g for 15 min [<15>]. Tau multimers were only observed after prolonged exposure during ECL reaction indicating that these multimers are proportionally very small fractions [<15>]. In our hand, analysis of TBS-extractable tau fraction using two other SDS-PAGE buffer systems—a Bis-Tris gel system operating pH of 7.0 and a Tris-acetate gel system operating pH of 8.1—showed that under non-reducing conditions tau multimers migrate to ~120 kDa and ~130 kDa, molecular sizes consistent with those of tau dimer species weighing 50–60 kDa and 64 kDa, respectively ([<30>,<40>] and <Fig. 4B>). We found that most tau dimers were 64 kDa tau species, whereas most tau monomers were normal tau (<Fig. 4B>). However, these reducing agent sensitive tau dimers were not detected in previous rTg4510 studies [<15>]. Although we cannot resolve this discrepancy, differences between previous and present studies were tissue preparation protocols (150,000×g and 27,000×g centrifugations for TBS-extraction, respectively) and the age of mice for the reducing agent sensitivity analysis (3.5 month-old in [<15>], and 6 month-old rTg4510 mice in the present study, respectively). It is conceivable that tau dimers composed of either normal tau or 64 kDa tau species can be recognized by the antibody TOC1, which was raised against cross-linked tau dimer and detected tau oligomers [<41>]. To determine whether cognitive function and neuronal loss are triggered by the same subspecies of tau, the correlation analysis between cognitive performance of rTg4510 mice and levels of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau species need to be examined in future.Mass spectrometric analysis and mapping using phosphoepitope-specific antibodies of AD brain samples have revealed that insoluble tau possesses 45 phosphorylation sites (for review, see [<42>]). Under physiological conditions, tau phosphorylation sites may turn over rapidly through the regulation of multiple kinases and phosphatases. In brains undergoing tauopathy, abnormal highly phosphorylated tau seems to influence self-aggregation by maintaining a stable state of phosphorylation. In the present study, we observed more than 10 phosphoepitope-positive sites on TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau in 8 month-old rTg4510 mice. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that 64 kDa tau has multiple isoelectric points, ranging from pH 5.0 to pH 6.0. By contrast, the 4R0N tau isoform with P301L mutation has a theoretical isoelectric point of pH 9.4. Taken together, this indicates that the phosphorylation sites in 64 kDa tau neutralize the basic charge of tau. Most interestingly, multiple isoelectric points of 64 kDa tau indicate that 64 kDa tau is heterogeneously phosphorylated. Since it remains unknown which specific phosphorylation sites underlie the mobility shift of tau proteins in SDS-PAGE, it would be worthwhile to perform phosphopeptide mass spectrometry of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau species.In summary, the progression of tauopathy in rTg4510 mice is closely associated with the levels of a pool of abnormal tau. This abnormal tau appears as short filaments and granules representing oligomeric assemblies of 64 kDa hyperphosphorylated tau. Oligomer formation involves disulfide cross-linking between tau molecules. The resulting assembly intermediates are much more abundant than the end products of assembly. Our research goal is to identify the tau species that must be eliminated in order to halt or reverse tau-induced neurodegeneration. If the TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau species can be reversibly regulated, our finding will provide crucial information toward development of tau-based therapy. rhetorical Fig. 1 A. Comparison of two protocols for preparing sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Brain homogenates were separated into TBS-extractable (S1), high-salt and sarkosyl-extractable (S3), and sarkosyl-insoluble (P3) fractions.

Conditional overexpression of four-repeat human tau containing the P301L missense mutation in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy leads to progressive accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and hyperphosphorylated, sarkosyl-insoluble tau species, which are biochemically comparable to abnormal tau characteristic of hereditary tauopathies termed FTDP-17. To fully understand the impact of tau species at different stages of self-assembly on neurodegeneration, we fractionated rTg4510 brain representing several stages of tauopathy to obtain TBS-extractable (S1), high salt/sarkosyl-extractable (S3), and sarkosyl-insoluble (P3) fractions. Under reducing condition, the S1 fraction was demonstrated by Western blotting to contain both 50–60 kDa normally-sized and 64 kDa tau. Both are thermo-stable, but the 64 kDa tau showed a higher degree of phosphorylation. Under non-reducing condition, nearly all TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau were detected as ~130 kDa species consistent with the size of dimer. Quantitative analysis showed ~80 times more 64 kDa tau in S1 than P3 fraction. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed tau-positive granules/short filaments in S1 fraction. These structures displayed MC1 immunoreactivities indicative of conformational/pathological change of tau. MC1 immunoreactivity was detected by dot blotting in samples from 2.5 month-old mice, whereas Ab39 immunoreactivity indicative of late stages of tau assembly was detected only in P3 fraction. Quantitative analysis also demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between brain weight and 64 kDa tau, but the level of TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau reflects neurodegeneration better than that of sarkosyl-insoluble 64 kDa tau. Together, the findings suggest that TBS-extractable 64 kDa tau production is a potential target for therapeutic intervention of tauopathies. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4694579_0,"Accumulation of toxic protein aggregates—amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles—is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aβ accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance; indeed, Aβ clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how Aβ is cleared from the brain. Extracellular Aβ deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the blood–brain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular Aβ (eAβ) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAβ from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of Aβ clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess Aβ deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on Aβ.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and comprises early-onset AD (EOAD) and sporadic or late-onset AD (LOAD).<1>–<3> EOAD affects a minority of AD patients, whereas LOAD afflicts over 95% of patients with AD.<4>–<6> Both EOAD and LOAD are characterized by excessive accumulation of toxic forms of amyloid-β (Aβ), which has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between its production and clearance.<7>–<9> Emerging evidence suggests that Aβ clearance is impaired in both early-onset and late-onset forms of AD.<10>,<11> Specifically, carriers of EOAD-associated presenilin mutations show both increased Aβ production<10>,<12> and decreased Aβ clearance,<10> whereas individuals with LOAD exhibit decreased Aβ clearance only.<11>Failure of Aβ clearance is increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of AD. It is critical to understand how Aβ is cleared from the brain, and to find new ways of investigating this process in carefully phenotyped patients and healthy controls. Because Aβ deposition can be increased in presymptomatic individuals years or even decades before the hallmark symptoms of AD manifest,<20> an understanding of Aβ clearance might eventually provide strategies to reduce excess Aβ deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset.Soluble Aβ can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, including enzymatic degradation and cellular uptake, transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption into the circulatory and lymphatic systems.In the early 2000s, mouse studies demonstrated that the majority (75%) of extracellular Aβ (eAβ) is cleared by the BBB, with only a minority (10%) being cleared by ISF bulk flow.<14>,<15> However, two-photon imaging studies from the past few years have suggested that ISF bulk flow—facilitated by astroglial aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channels and named the glymphatic (glial + lymphatic) system—contributes to a larger portion of eAβ clearance than previously thought.<16>,<17> Furthermore, the discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels suggests yet another potential clearance route.<18> Although the relative contributions of each of these systems to overall clearance are unknown, they act together to drive eAβ from the brain, meaning that alterations in any given system can contribute to the altered pathophysiology and accumulation of lesions in AD.In this Review, we aim to describe the brain’s clearance systems that are related to removal of toxic accumulation of proteins in AD. Here, ‘clearance’ is defined broadly as the removal of any substance, such as Aβ, from the brain. We focus on Aβ, given its ability to form aggregates within the extracellular space, but also briefly cover tau, which needs to be investigated in parallel with Aβ. When characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, EOAD is related to mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) or amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes.<2>–<4> However, epidemiological data suggest that only a minority of EOAD cases demonstrate autosomal dominant transmission, leaving the genetic association of the majority of EOAD cases unexplained.<2>,<19>Various factors have been reported to positively and negatively modulate the risk of LOAD. Specifically, the greatest overall risk factor for LOAD is ageing;<20> for example, in the USA, over 40% of individuals above the age of 85 years have been diagnosed with AD.<21>–<24> The strongest identified genetic risk factor for LOAD is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele (APOE*ε4),<25>,<26> although genome-wide association studies have linked LOAD to several other genetic variants, such as TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2),<27> clusterin (CLU),<28> and phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM).<28>,<29> Known environmental risk factors for LOAD include cardiovascular disease, and factors conferring a risk of cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Head trauma, physical and mental inactivity, and sleep impairment are additional risk factors for LOAD.<13>,<30>–<35> AD is characterized by specific neuropathological and biomarker changes. The gross pathological changes consist of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampal formation, temporal lobes and parietotemporal cortices, accompanied by cortical thinning, enlarged ventricles and white matter abnormalities, as evident on MRI.<36>,<37> Microscopic changes include accumulation of Aβ into parenchymal senile plaques (also known as neuritic plaques) or in the walls of cerebral capillaries and arteries (known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA), as well as aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads.<36>,<38> The severity of CAA, the NFT load, and the magnitude of synapse loss—but not the number and extent of amyloid plaques—correlate well with the degree of cognitive decline.<39>–<44> These AD-related neuro-pathological changes presumably occur decades before symptom onset, because they are also found in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and in people with no cognitive symptoms.<20> Recent advances now enable several AD-related brain changes to be detected in vivo: 18F-FDG-PET detects decreases in glucose metabolism,<45>,<46> and MRI detects brain atrophy, as well as diffusion and perfusion abnormalities, which are most prominent in the vulnerable hippocampal formation and cortical regions.<47>–<49> The pathological accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins in the brain can be inferred by analysing their levels in the CSF, with longitudinal changes having been described and modelled.<50>–<53> Specifically, Aβ accumulation into extracellular plaques is marked by decreased CSF levels of Aβ1–42, and tau accumulation into NFTs is marked by increased CSF levels of total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau.<51>,<54> In addition, PET can be used to assess Aβ brain accumulation directly,<50> and PET for tau is currently under investigation.<52>,<55> The removal of soluble waste from the brain occurs via various overlapping clearance systems, which can be classified according to the compartment from which the waste is directly cleared, and the compartment into which the waste is directly cleared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4694579_1,"Protein waste can be cleared from the intracellular compartment, or from the extracellular compartment, which comprises the ISF that surrounds neurons and the CSF that surrounds the brain  These proteins can then be removed by enzymes or cellular uptake, exported into the blood or lymph, or recirculated in the CSF (<Table 1>). The relative contributions of each of the various clearance systems are currently unknown; the prevailing view is that the BBB clearance predominates, though recent studies involving perivascular CSF circulation challenge this view, making clearance systems of the brain an important area for future research. Degradation clearance is the enzymatic breakdown of proteins in the brain, and entails both extracellular and intracellular degradation. Extracellular degradation of ISF proteins mainly consists of degradation by proteases expressed and secreted by cells such as astrocytes.<56>,<57> ISF proteins can also be taken up from the extracellular space to be degraded intracellularly in neurons or glia, including phagocytic microglia and astrocytes.<58>–<60> Intracellular degradation of proteins occurs via the ubiquitin– proteasome pathway, the autophagy–lysosome pathway, and the endosome–lysosome pathway.<56> Interstitial proteins can be cleared into the blood directly at the BBB through specialized transport systems located in the brain endothelium.<61>–<64> The BBB endothelial cells are connected by tight junctions and have two functionally distinct sides: the luminal side facing the blood circulation, and the abluminal side facing the brain parenchyma.<65> In addition to the BBB, the brain is also protected by the so-called ‘glial barrier’ (also known as the glia limitans) that surrounds the BBB and consists of astroglial endfeet processes that cover the majority of the parenchymal vasculature, with the remaining area consisting of intercellular astrocytic endfeet clefts forming gap junctions.<66> The BBB and glial barrier are part of the neurovascular unit, which comprises various components, including cerebral microvascular endothelium, basement membrane, contractile pericytes (which share the capillary basement membrane with the endothelium), smooth muscle cells (which invest the endothelium of precapillary arterioles), astroglia, and neurons.<67>Transport at the neurovascular unit across the glial barrier and BBB depends on the solubility, molecular weight and diameter of the protein.<68>,<69> The relatively large size of the intercellular clefts (20 nm)<70>,<71> implies that the glial barrier is permeable to nearly all proteins.<66> Given the size of AD-related proteins, monomeric Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42 and tau, should be able to pass freely through astrocytic endfeet clefts at the glial barrier.<72> However, endothelial tight junctions at the BBB prevent free passage of Aβ and tau into the blood, so they must instead be transported across the endothelium by specialized transporters, which, as descried below, have been identified for Aβ, but not for tau. ISF proteins can also be cleared directly into the CSF via ISF bulk flow<73> that enters the CSF sink (described below) or the perivascular space (sometimes referred to the paravascular space—we use the term ‘perivascular space’ to describe the region surrounding the parenchymal vasculature). In parts of the body other than the CNS, lymphatic vessels run in parallel with the circulatory system to clear waste from the ISF in the form of lymph. Lymphatic vessels have recently been described in the meninges surrounding the mouse brain,<18> but the brain parenchyma itself is devoid of such vessels, leading to the long-held assumption that CSF serves as a ‘lymph equivalent’ to clear waste from the CNS.<74>,<75> Apart from transport across the endothelium, the removal of ISF from the brain parenchyma was traditionally believed to occur by diffusion<76> or ISF bulk flow into the CSF sink, which comprises the ventricles and subarachnoid space.<77> Given that diffusion is dependent on molecular size, diffusion into the CSF sink has been proposed to be too slow for the highly metabolic and large human brain.<77> As such, ISF bulk flow, which is independent of molecular size, has been proposed as the predominant pathway for movement of large molecules into the CSF sink.<77> ISF bulk flow was initially thought to course through the brain in a diffuse manner, but later evidence (described below) suggests the existence of definite pathways.<78> Support for an anatomically specific bulk-flow system came from a study of perivascular circulation.<79> Following infusion of horseradish peroxidase into the lateral ventricles or subarachnoid space of anaesthetized cats and dogs, CSF within the subarachnoid space flowed freely through the Virchow–Robin space—a histologically defined space where the subarachnoid space meets the perivascular space. From the Virchow–Robin space, CSF travelled into the periarterial spaces that surround penetrating arteries, moving along specific pathways in the same direction as blood flow.<79> CSF was also shown to move from the perivascular space into the interstitial ISF.<79> This perivascular circulation hypothesis challenged the traditional model of one-way flow of ISF into the CSF sink.<77>,<80>,<81>Mouse model<82> and human<83> studies involving fluorescent soluble tracers and confocal microscopy have demonstrated that following intracerebral injection, ISF solutes diffuse and enter perivascular drainage pathways along the basement membrane of capillary and arterial walls separating smooth muscle cells,<84> then move towards the leptomeningeal arteries at the surface of the brain and, ultimately, to cervical lymph nodes (<Figure 1>).<84> This pathway was named the perivascular drainage pathway, and was deemed to be the lymphatic drainage of the brain.<44>The perivascular circulation hypothesis<79> was recently confirmed and expanded on by a study in mice.<16> Following tracer injection into the CSF at the cisterna magna, two-photon microscopy was used to visualize in real time the flux of CSF in living mice through a closed cranial window.<16> As already hypothesized decades ago,<74> CSF was found to act like lymph: it flushed out interstitial substances in a process facilitated by glial cells, prompting the authors to name it the glymphatic system (<Figure 1>).<16> This evidence corroborated prior findings that CSF, driven by arterial pulsation, flows into the periarterial space, following the course of the arterial vascular smooth muscle basement membrane to reach the basal lamina of the brain capillary bed, and entering the interstitium at all levels of this perivascular route.<79> The work also confirmed that ISF moves by bulk flow.<77> Moreover, the study extended these findings to include a role for astroglial AQP4 channels. These channels were found to mediate CSF transport from the periarterial space across the pial–glial membrane into the interstitium, where it mixes with ISF. The pia has been shown to be relatively permeable:<16>,<85> tracers injected into the subarachnoid space rapidly enter the perivascular space and brain parenchyma.<16> CSF–ISF movement from the interstitium into the perivenous space of deep draining veins runs ventromedially towards ventricular and deep white matter structures.<85> Hydrostatic pressure of periarterial bulk flow has been speculated to drive CSF water through the AQP4 channels, which is followed by astrocytic passage of molecules both through clefts and across astrocytes to maintain osmotic balance, although the mechanism has not been fully elucidated.<16> Any remaining CSF components course along the capillary basal lamina.<87>,<79>It is unclear whether the perivascular drainage pathway and the glymphatic pathway are in fact distinct pathways, or whether they simply reflect transport along the same pathway captured under differing physiological or experimental conditions. In another study using two-photon imaging, fluorescent tracers were injected directly into the mouse brain via an open skull. Periarterial tracer accumulation was observed, although the direction of the flow was not discerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4694579_2,"<88> Opening of the skull is suggested to be a confounding factor in many experiments involving circulation of CSF, because skull removal can lead to inflammation and mechanical injuries to the cortical surface, or disturb local blood perfusion, BBB permeability and brain homeostasis <89>–<92> Regardless, as recently suggested, the perivascular drainage and glymphatic pathways are not mutually exclusive: both could be active depending on the conditions, and the pathway in use could even be different between vessels or within the same vessel at different times (<Figure 1>).<86> Following clearance from the ISF into the CSF, proteins must be cleared from the brain. Circulating CSF can be absorbed directly into the circulatory or lymphatic systems. Although other CSF production sites have also been suggested,<93>–<95> the majority of CSF seems to be produced at the BCSFB by the choroid plexus, a vascular unit of capillaries comprised of fenestrated endothelium and covered by choroid plexus epithelium (modified epen-dymal cells with tight junctions), located in the ventricles. The BCSFB serves not only as a CSF production site, but also as a ventricular CSF solute clearance site.<96>,<97> According to the traditional view, following CSF production by the choroid plexus, CSF circulates within the subarachnoid space, from where it is primarily cleared from the brain at arachnoid villi (also known as arachnoid granulations)— one-way valve structures leading to the dural venous sinuses.<98> As described above, circulating CSF within the perivascular space can be cleared from the brain to cervical lymph nodes.<84>,<16> Another clearance route for circulating CSF to cervical lymph nodes is along perineural spaces, extensions of the subarachnoid space surrounding nerves.<99>,<100> Furthermore, the recent development of a method for mounting of whole meninges, such that mouse meninges can be examined intact on a single slide, led to the discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels, which might provide another clearance route for circulating CSF proteins.<18> These meningeal lymphatic vessels might also provide a more conventional path for immune cells to exit the CNS, and dysfunction of these vessels might have important implications for neurological disorders associated with altered immune responses.<18> Aβ is produced during neuronal activity<101> from amyloid precursor protein (APP), a membrane protein that acts as a signalling receptor.<101>,<102> In nonpathological conditions, APP is cleaved by α-secretase, which precludes formation of Aβ, and the resulting carboxy-terminal fragment is then cleaved by γ-secretase.<103> The resulting products do not aggregate.<104>If APP is first cleaved by β-secretase 1 (also known as BACE1) instead of α-secretase, the subsequent γ-secretase cleavage will result in soluble monomeric Aβ. The most common soluble monomeric isoforms of Aβ are Aβ1–40 (<80%), Aβ1–38 (<20%) and Aβ1–42 (10%).<105> Aβ1–40 is prone to be deposited in the vasculature, as seen in CAA.<15>,<106> Aβ1–38 is less likely to aggregate in either the vasculature or the brain than the other isoforms.<107>,<108> Aβ1–42 has two additional amino acids, making it more hydrophobic than Aβ1–40;<109> thus, it is capable of forming insoluble aggregates.<110> The tendency of Aβ1–42 to form hard-to-clear aggregates is particularly increased when the concentration of Aβ1–42 is high, and at a lower pH.<111>–<114>The different forms of Aβ are in a dynamic equilibrium, and dense amyloid plaques can slough off soluble monomeric Aβ1–42, which can then reform into aggregates.<115> Reflecting the equilibrium, in a longitudinal study of individuals carrying EOAD-linked presenilin mutation, CSF Aβ levels were initially reduced owing to aggregation of Aβ1–42 into plaques.<10> Impaired clearance can, thus, result from Aβ aggregation— especially aggregation of Aβ1–42—rather than from an intrinsic defect in the clearance system. Nonetheless, Aβ clearance systems can also become dysfunctional, as discussed below (<Figure 2> and <Table 2>). Intracellular Aβ (iAβ) can be degraded by proteasomes via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in neurons,<116> lysosomal cathepsin enzymes,<117> proteases (such as insulin-degrading enzyme, a thiol metalloendopeptidase that degrades monomeric Aβ) and insulin.<118> Extracellular Aβ can also be degraded by proteases, such as neprilysin (a membrane-anchored zinc metalloendopeptidase that degrades the Aβ monomers Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, and Aβ oligomers),<119> matrix metalloproteinases 2, 3 and 9,<120> glutamate carboxypeptidase II,<121> endothelin-converting enzyme,<122> tissue plasminogen activator,<123> plasmin,<120> angiotensin-converting enzyme,<120> and insulin-degrading enzyme.<124> In addition, eAβ can be degraded following glial phagocytosis. Specifically, ISF Aβ can be taken up by microglia and astrocytes, whereas perivascular Aβ can be degraded by vascular smooth muscle cells, perivascular macrophages, and astrocytes (<Figure 2>).<125>Degradation clearance of Aβ is affected by four main factors: enzyme expression and activity, ligand affinity and competition, activation of cellular uptake, and initiation of intracellular degradation pathways (<Table 1>), all of which become impaired with ageing and in AD. First, expression of neprilysin is decreased in AD,<126> especially in regions with high Aβ loads such as the hippocampus and temporal gyrus.<127> Although overall matrix metallo-proteinase 2 expression is increased in AD,<58> its activity is reduced in astrocytes that surround Aβ plaques.<128> Second, both Aβ and insulin are ligands that compete for degradation by insulin-degrading enzyme; thus, hyper-insulinaemia can reduce clearance of Aβ, which might partly explain the link between type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD.<13> Third, plaques activate the immune effectors of the CNS—microglia and astrocytes<129>—inducing both phagocytosis of Aβ, which facilitates clearance from the extracellular space, and production of neurotoxic inflammatory cytokines.<130> Aβ that has undergone cellular uptake can then be degraded, for example via the autophagy–lysosome pathway<131> or be released back into the extracellular space,<130> as found in the brains of patients with AD.<132>,<133> Last, in AD, Aβ degradation via the endosome–lysosome pathway is increased relative to lysosomal degradation:<134> endocytic activity is elevated, resulting in accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, presence of lysosomal cathepsin enzymes in Aβ plaques, and abnormally enlarged endosomes containing Aβ, leading to generalized proteasome dysfunction.<134>,<135> Aβ is transported from the interstitial space across the BBB and into blood, and vice versa (<Figure 3>).<123> Specifically, local soluble Aβ is transferred from the interstitium to the brain by LDL receptor (LDLR) family members such as LRP1, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters).<14>,<136> Some evidence suggests that LRP1 is the main transporter for Aβ efflux at the BBB, whereas other studies have demonstrated its role to be quite minor.<137>–<139>The main ABC transporter responsible for Aβ efflux is ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein 1 or MDR1), which directly exports Aβ into the circulation. ABCA1, which is located on the abluminal side of the brain endothelium,<140> does not directly bind and extrude Aβ,<141> but mediates Aβ clearance in an ApoE-dependent manner.<142> The precise mechanism by which abluminal ABCA1 mediates Aβ clearance is unknown, although this transporter has been proposed to induce ApoE lipidation, which facilitates ApoE-Aβ interaction in the perivascular space, making Aβ more accessible to transport by LRP1 or ABCB1.<143> Clearance of Aβ through the BBB is also mediated by α2-macroglobulin (α2M),<14> and LDLR-related protein 2 (LRP2, also known as megalin) when LRP2 forms a complex with clusterin (also known as ApoJ).<14>,<136> In addition, insulin-degrading enzyme has been proposed to have a role in Aβ clearance through the BBB, which might explain why BBB clearance is sensitive to insulin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4694579_3,"<144>Free Aβ can be transported from the circulation into the interstitium via RAGE (advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor) <136>,<145> Soluble transporters (also known as sequestering agents)—such as the soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE),<14> anti-Aβ IgG,<14> serum amyloid P component (SAP),<14> and the soluble form of LRP (sLRP), which binds 70–90% of plasma Aβ—bind to soluble Aβ and inhibit its binding to RAGE, thereby preventing Aβ from entering the interstitium.<146> Clearance of Aβ through the BBB is affected by transporter expression and activity, ligand affinity and competition, and vascular integrity (<Table 1>). In AD, these factors are impaired in a number of ways. First, expression of the blood efflux transporters LRP1<123> and ABCB1<147> is decreased, whereas expression of the blood influx transporter RAGE is upregulated.<123>Second, oxidative changes in AD are linked to changes in sLRP that reduce its affinity for Aβ, potentially facilitating Aβ influx into the interstitium by RAGE.<123> Inflammation, a common feature of AD, can affect ligand affinity by making the pH more acidic, which promotes hyperphosphorylation of tau and induces conformational changes in Aβ that hinder its clearance.<148>,<149> ApoE is a cholesterol transporter that competes with Aβ for efflux by LRP1 from the interstitium into the circulation;<150> competition for shared receptors is the primary mechanism by which ApoE mediates Aβ clearance.<151> The strongest genetic risk factor for AD is APOE*ε4<152> (APOE*ε4>APOE*ε3>APOE*ε2<151>), which codes for an ApoE isoform that is less efficient at mediating Aβ clearance than are the other ApoE isoforms.<153>Third, ApoE4 is also associated with lower antioxidant activity than other ApoE isoforms,<154>,<155> and it mediates BBB breakdown through a proinflammatory pathway involving cyclophilin A in pericytes.<156> These findings are in line with evidence suggesting that increased oxidative stress<157> and loss of vascular integrity contribute to ageing<158> and AD,<159> as demonstrated by accelerated breakdown of the BBB and the neurovascular unit. ISF bulk-flow clearance removes ISF—which contains eAβ—from the interstitium via ISF bulk flow into the CSF sink and perivascular space.<16>,<44> Here, we will discuss perivascular clearance of Aβ specifically via the perivascular drainage and glymphatic pathways. Aβ is cleared along perivascular drainage pathways.<83> In both AD<44>,<160> and CAA<44> (commonly associated with AD<84>), perivascular drainage of Aβ is impaired. Known factors affecting perivascular drainage of Aβ include APOE*ε4, deposition of immune complexes, arterial age, and—possibly—arterial pulsation (<Table 1>). The presence of ApoE4 is associated with reduced perivascular drainage of Aβ,<161> which in turn is linked to deposition of immune complexes.<162> Perivascular drainage of Aβ fails as arteries age;<163> this failure is associated not only with loss of homeostasis<164> and elevated levels of soluble Aβ in the brain, but also with accumulation of Aβ in arterial walls (as seen in CAA), which increases the risk of intracerebral lobar haemorrhages.<165> One of the main complications following immunization against Aβ is the solubilization of Aβ from plaques and entrapment in perivascular drainage pathways, which worsens CAA.<162>,<166> It is possible that arterial pulsation drives perivascular drainage of ISF solutes,<88>,<167> and that morphological changes associated with age-related arteriosclerosis result in failure of perivascular drainage.<168> Of note, a high-fat prenatal maternal diet has recently been reported to result in a failure of Aβ clearance along cerebrovascular basement membranes. This failure was exacerbated if the high-fat diet had been lifelong, suggesting a role for epigenetic changes and diet in AD pathogenesis.<169>,<170> Recent mouse studies suggest that the AQP4-dependent glymphatic pathway is an important clearance system for driving the removal of soluble Aβ from the interstitium. In mice, Aβ is cleared along perivascular pathways, and Aβ clearance was reduced by 55–65% in Aqp4 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice.<16>,<171> Furthermore, glymphatic clearance was reduced by 40% in aged relative to young mice,<17> suggesting that the glymphatic pathway is impaired with age, which, as mentioned above, is the primary risk factor for LOAD.Potential factors affecting glymphatic ISF bulk flow include molecular size, arterial pulsation, AQP4 expression and localization, and sleep (<Table 1>). Following subarachnoid injection, larger tracer molecules are slower to enter the parenchyma than are smaller tracers, and soluble perivascular Aβ can cross the 20 nm astrocytic endfeet clefts.<16>Arterial pulsation is critical for perivascular circulation and transport of CSF into the interstitium.<79>,<172>,<173> Recirculating Aβ-rich CSF within the periarterial space, might be taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly in the presence of glymphatic stasis (caused by reduced arterial pulsation) that could facilitate protein misfolding and aggregation.<81>,<174>–<176> This is one mechanism by which Aβ might accumulate in the periarterial space, as seen in CAA, and the resulting Aβ accumulation might block perivascular pathways, further reducing glymphatic clearance.<87>In Aqp4 knockout mice, interstitial clearance is reduced by about 70%, resulting in a 55–65% reduction in Aβ clearance.<16>,<171> In AD, AQP4 expression could be decreased, given that in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes, interstitial Aβ1–42 reduces AQP4 expression,<177> which can lead to additional accumulation of plaque-forming Aβ1–42.<178> In traumatic brain injury (TBI)—a risk factor for AD— reactive gliosis is increased.<178> Initially, AQP4 expression is increased in TBI, but long-lasting AQP4 mislocalization from perivascular endfeet to the astrocytic soma occurs, resulting in reduced perivascular AQP4 availability, which can reduce Aβ clearance.<66>,<171> Both TBI and AD are associated with perivascular inflammation,<16>,<66> and these changes might partly explain the link between these conditions.<13>In mice, Aβ clearance during sleep is twice as fast as during awake periods.<179> This increase in Aβ elimination is mediated by a 60% increase in the volume of the extracellular space, which might be modulated by a change in astrocyte cell volume in response to change in adrenergic signalling, as would be expected during sleep.<179>–<182> This expansion of the extracellular space was caused by sleep itself rather than circadian rhythms, as it not only occurred during normal sleep, but could also be induced with anaesthesia.<17>,<179> It should be noted, however, that circadian rhythm disturbances have been reported in patients with AD,<183> and might affect clearance through a different mechanism involving increased oxidative stress caused by decreased expression of circadian clock genes, which are involved in protection from oxidative damage.<184>,<185>The recent study describing the glymphatic system demonstrated that accelerated ISF-to-CSF bulk flow was partly responsible for the increase in total Aβ clearance during sleep, representing about 40% of total clearance, which can be calculated from the clearance rate constant data.<179> The remaining 60% is probably attributable to accelerated BBB transport of Aβ, because during these transport clearance measurements, the degradation of AB was minimal, which is in line with previous reports.<178>,<179> This finding might result from the glymphatic system flushing Aβ toward the BBB during sleep. Thus, sleep could indirectly increase BBB clearance of Aβ through increased glymphatic bulk flow, but it might also directly increase clearance through the BBB via various mechanisms, such as molecular changes (for example, upregulated LRP1), as seen with AD-protective physical and cognitive activity in mice.<187>–<189> These findings might partly explain why sleep impairment increases the risk of AD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4694579_4,"<33>,<35> Aβ in the circulating CSF can be absorbed either through the arachnoid villi<196> and BCSFB<136> into the circulation, or through the perivascular<16>,<44> and perineural spaces<191>— and possibly the meningeal lymphatics<18>—into the lymphatic system CSF absorption clearance of Aβ by the circulatory and lymphatic systems depends on CSF production, BCSFB integrity and transporters, arachnoid villi resistance, and lymphatic absorption of the CSF (<Table 1>). In ageing and AD, these factors are impaired in a number of ways. First, in ageing, and particularly in AD, CSF production by the choroid plexus is reduced, as shown by decreased water secretion into the ventricles via AQP1 water channels.<192> In AD, the choroid plexus undergoes many structural changes, such as calcification, fibrosis and Aβ deposition, all of which can obstruct CSF production.<193>Second, these structural changes affect BCSFB integrity, thereby reducing Aβ clearance. Many of the Aβ transporters expressed at the BBB, including LRP1, LRP2, ABCB1 and RAGE, are also found at the BCSFB.<194> LRP1 is likely to have an important role in ventricular Aβ clearance at the BCSFB, given that the overall clearance rate of Aβ from the CSF is fivefold faster than the rate observed via CSF flow through the arachnoid villi.<195> However, the age-related change in expression of many BCSFB transporters follows an opposite pattern to that observed at the BBB for Aβ, such that there is increased efflux and decreased influx transporter expression, which is suggested to be a result of the BCSFB compensating for age-dependent BBB transporter defects.<136>Third, CSF outflow resistance at the arachnoid villi is increased in AD.<196> This increased resistance is mechanistically similar to normal pressure hydrocephalus,<196> and has been proposed to result from amyloid deposition and fibrosis at the arachnoid villi,<197> resulting in decreased CSF bulk outflow and, thus, decreased CSF Aβ absorption into the blood. Although no evidence has yet been obtained that CSF Aβ levels initially increase in LOAD, reduced CSF turnover would be expected to result in heavily Aβ-laden recirculating CSF, subsequently resulting in reduced concentration as Aβ is deposited in plaques,<111> in the vasculature as CAA,<175> and in the meninges, thereby increasing outflow resistance at the arachnoid villi.<98>Last, lymphatic absorption of CSF decreases with age<98>—the primary risk factor for LOAD. In EOAD, by contrast, overproduction of Aβ might result in increased absorption of Aβ by the lymphatic system, as demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model of AD, in which increasing Aβ levels in cervical and axillary lymph nodes mirrored increased Aβ levels in the brain.<198> Tau—a splicing variant of the microtubule- associated protein tau (MAPT)—is an intracellular neuronal protein that stabilizes axons.<199> Intracellular tau (i-tau) can undergo two transformations that are relevant to its clearance: modification and release. Tau modification is regulated by phosphorylation. i-Tau can undergo nondegradative cleavage by proteolytic enzymes, such as aminopeptidases, thrombin, HTRA1, calpain and caspases.<135> Rather than degrading tau, these enzymes produce proteolytic fragments, which can ultimately be degraded; however, these fragments have an increased propensity to form aggregates, resulting in reduced clearance. In AD, i-tau is hyperphosphorylated, which induces the formation of insoluble NFTs that cannot readily be cleared, and can also be neurotoxic.<200> Neuronal activation (namely, presynaptic glutamate release),<201> neuronal death and increased i-tau concentration or aggregation<202> trigger the release of i-tau into the extracellular space, leading to elevated CSF tau levels.Tau clearance is less well understood than Aβ clearance, but also seems to be less complex. Transporters that specifically transport tau through the BBB have not been identified, which suggests that tau does not undergo clearance through the BBB, except after brain injury, when BBB permeability is temporarily increased.<203> Instead, tau is thought to be cleared from the brain primarily by degradation, ISF bulk flow, and CSF absorption clearance (<Table 2>). Recent studies using passive immunization with anti-tau oligomer antibodies have shown that like Aβ, pathological tau can be cleared from the brain by a peripheral sink mechanism, indicating that enhancement of tau clearance might be a therapeutic strategy in AD.<204> Tau is mainly cleared through intracellular degradation by lysosomes via the autophagy–lysosome pathway, and by proteasomes via the ubiquitin– proteasome pathway.<202> AD-related dysfunction of these pathways has been suggested to result in the accumulation of soluble i-tau.<135> i-Tau can also be degraded by proteases (such as caspases) in response to apoptosis- inducing stressors, and by calpain in response to elevated intracellular calcium concentrations. Phosphorylation of tau by protein kinase A increases its resistance to degradation by calpain; thus, AD-associated hyperphosphorylation of tau has been suggested to impair tau turnover and result in tau accumulation in the form of NFTs.<205> Following release of i-tau into the extracellular space—a process that could result from neuronal death or stimulation<202>—e-tau can be internalized by other neurons via endocytosis, leading to prion-like spreading of tau pathology.<206> In addition, soluble e-tau might bind to muscarinic type 1 and type 3 receptors, thereby increasing intracellular calcium levels, which might facilitate further release of i-tau.<202> Tau released into the extracellular space is highly stable:<207> its CSF half-life is 12–14 h,<208> compared with about 2 h for Aβ.<209> If e-tau is not cleared by endocytosis, it might be cleared via the glymphatic system.<210> Following TBI, glymphatic clearance of ISF solutes was impaired by about 60% in wild-type mice, and to an even greater extent in Aqp4 knockout mice that displayed NFTs, neuroinflammatory reactive gliosis, and neurodegeneration.<210> These findings support the link between TBI and tau aggregation, with resulting neurodegeneration similar to that seen in AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.<210>,<211> Recirculation of CSF poses an additional challenge to tau clearance: cells closest to the periarterial boundary might internalize tau from the tau-laden recirculating CSF within the periarterial space.<175> As for any soluble substance in circulating CSF, tau can be absorbed either into the circulatory system from the arachnoid villi and BCSFB, or from the lymphatic system through the perivascular and perineural spaces. Meningeal lymphatic vessels<18> provide another possible route, although their specific contribution to tau elimination has not been tested. Removal of proteins from the brain occurs via various overlapping clearance systems: enzymatic degradation and cellular uptake, transport across the BBB and BCSFB, ISF bulk flow, and absorption of CSF into the circulatory and lymphatic systems (<Table 1>). The majority of eAβ is cleared across the BBB, with a minority being cleared by ISF bulk flow (<Figure 2> and <Table 2>).<14>,<15> However, the recently discovered glymphatic pathway (<Figure 1>) also seems to be an important contributor to eAβ clearance, because it can flush Aβ towards the perivascular space, thereby mediating clearance through the BBB (<Figure 3>) or re-entry into the capillary basement membranes.<16>,<17> The recently discovered meningeal lymphatic vessels might provide another clearance route,<18> but their role in Aβ and tau clearance has not yet been assessed. In contrast with Aβ, tau does not seem to undergo receptor-mediated BBB clearance; thus, the elimination of tau seems less complex than that of Aβ. However, the mechanisms involved in the clearance of tau from the brain are not completely understood, and further research into tau trafficking could help us better understand its role in AD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4694579_5,"Recent evidence for Aβ accumulation in LOAD points to reduced clearance, as opposed to overproduction, as the main culprit, but which specific clearance systems are defective is unclear <10>,<11> The evidence for clearance failure in AD comes from the use of stable isotope labelling kinetics,<212> which enable measurement of both Aβ production and clearance in humans. However, this technique does not provide information on the specific clearance systems themselves but, rather, provides a composite of production and clearance measures for Aβ. This technological progress has introduced an urgent need for detailed information on the specific Aβ clearance defects in patients with AD. Likewise, a technique to measure overall tau clearance and specific tau clearance defects in AD is needed, because such defects might be expected in light of the reduced CSF production and arachnoid villi defects that are observed in ageing individuals and patients with AD.Because Aβ deposition can be increased in presymptomatic individuals years or even decades before the hallmark symptoms of AD manifest, an understanding of Aβ clearance might eventually provide strategies to restore clearance mechanisms, so as to eliminate excess Aβ deposits and delay or possibly even prevent disease onset. Whether the observed clearance defect in AD is a cause or a consequence of pathology, or merely coincidental, remains unknown. Regardless, Aβ clearance defects are a consistent finding in patients with AD, and might provide a useful biomarker and indicator of reversible clinical pathology. rhetorical Figure 1 Perivascular clearance comprises perivascular drainage and glymphatic pathways. The perivascular drainage Nature Reviews | Neurology pathway (white arrows) moves waste into the periarterial space (located along smooth muscle cells and the capillary basement membrane) and towards the subarachnoid space in the direction opposite to blood flow. The glymphatic pathway (black arrows) clears waste from the ISF through the brain parenchyma, and comprises three functional components. (1) CSF influx, unidirectionally with blood flow, into the periarterial space (between the basement membrane of smooth muscle cells and pia mater), where the water component of CSF crosses astrocytic AQP4 channels to enter the brain parenchyma. CSF solutes can be cleared with astroglial transporters or channels, or can pass through the astrocytic endfeet clefts. (2) CSF–ISF exchange within the brain parenchyma. (3) CSF–ISF movement into the perivenous space of deep-draining veins. Effluxed waste can then recirculate with the CSF, or eventually be absorbed into the lymphatic system.

340, 1529–1530 (2013). rhetorical Figure 2 Aβ clearance systems. Soluble Aβ can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems. Degradation clearance via extracellular and intracellular degradation pathways can involve either cellular uptake from the interstitium by neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, or uptake from the perivascular space by smooth muscle cells, perivascular macrophages, and astrocytes. BBB clearance involves Aβ efflux into the blood. ISF bulk flow clearance can occur into the CSF sink (ventricles and subarachnoid space), via perivascular drainage pathway, or via glymphatic pathway. CSF absorption clearance involves absorption either into the circulatory system from the arachnoid villi and BCSFB, or into the lymphatic system from the perivascular and perineural spaces—and possibly through meningeal lymphatic vessels.

PMC4694579_6,"Aβ accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance; indeed, Aβ clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD  To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how Aβ is cleared from the brain. Extracellular Aβ deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the blood–brain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular Aβ (eAβ) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAβ from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of Aβ clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess Aβ deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on Aβ. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_0,"Misfolded tau proteins are characteristic of tauopathies, but the isoform composition of tau inclusions varies by tauopathy. Using aggregates of the longest tau isoform (containing four microtubule-binding repeats, 4-repeat tau), we recently described a direct mechanism of toxicity that involves exposure of the N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) in tau, which triggers a signaling pathway that disrupts axonal transport. However, the impact of aggregation on PAD exposure for other tau isoforms was unexplored. Here, results from immunochemical assays indicate that aggregation-induced increases in PAD exposure and oligomerization are common features among all tau isoforms. The extent of PAD exposure and oligomerization was larger for tau aggregates composed of 4-repeat isoforms compared to those made of 3-repeat isoforms. Importantly, aggregates of all isoforms exhibited enough PAD exposure to significantly impair axonal transport in the squid axoplasm. We also show that PAD exposure and oligomerization represent common pathological characteristics in multiple tauopathies. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism of toxicity common to each tau isoform that likely contributes to degeneration in different tauopathies.

All authors have reviewed the contents of the manuscript being submitted, approve of its contents and validate the accuracy of the data. A group of diseases collectively known as tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein called tau (<Crowther and Goedert, 2000>). In addition to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this group of diseases includes corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick’s disease (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), among others (<Spillantini and Goedert, 2013>). Each disease is characterized by pathognomonic tau inclusions, such as the neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and neuritic plaques in AD, glial (astrocytic and oligodendroglial) inclusions in CBD and PSP, neuronal Pick bodies in PiD or mixed neuronal and glial inclusions in CTE (<Kovacs, 2015>,<McKee, et al., 2013>,<Yoshida, 2006>). The clinical symptoms and affected brain regions further differentiate tauopathies. Interestingly, there is an apparent link between tau isoforms and different human tauopathies, as there is some degree of specificity for certain tau isoforms forming the pathognomonic tau inclusion of each disease (<Kovacs, 2015>).In the adult human central nervous system, tau is normally expressed as six isoforms that are derived from alternative splicing of three exons (<Wang and Mandelkow, 2016>). Alternative splicing of exon 10, located in the second microtubule-binding repeat, gives rise to isoforms containing either 4 or 3 microtubule-binding repeat domains (4R or 3R, respectively). The 4R and 3R isoforms are further separated into three distinct isoforms that contain either exons 2 and 3, exon 2 only, or neither of these exons. Multiple studies provide evidence that tau isoforms exhibit differing properties in terms of microtubule binding affinity (<Butner and Kirschner, 1991>,<Litersky, et al., 1993>,<Trinczek, et al., 1995>,<Voss and Gamblin, 2009>), microtubule bundling (<Chen, et al., 1992>,<Kanai, et al., 1989>,<Scott, et al., 1992>), regulation of microtubule dynamics (<Bunker, et al., 2004>,<Goedert and Jakes, 1990>,<Levy, et al., 2005>,<Panda, et al., 2003>,<Scott, et al., 1991>,<Trinczek, et al., 1995>), levels of expression during development (<Boutajangout, et al., 2004>,<Goedert and Jakes, 1990>,<Hong, et al., 1998>) and/or aggregate formation in vitro (<Adams, et al., 2010>,<Combs, et al., 2011>,<King, et al., 2000>,<Voss and Gamblin, 2009>,<Zhong, et al., 2012>). However, the biological importance and disease relevance of each tau isoform remains relatively unclear. In the context of human disease, the pathology of AD and CTE is largely comprised of a mixture of 3R and 4R tau isoforms, the inclusions in CBD, PSP and FTDP-17 are primarily composed of 4R isoforms and PiD pathology mostly contains 3R tau isoforms (<Buee and Delacourte, 1999>,<Ferrer, et al., 2014>,<Goedert, et al., 1992>,<Munoz, et al., 2003>,<Sergeant, et al., 1999>,<Yoshida, 2006>). Although these differences are well documented, the question of whether there are common or diseases specific mechanisms of toxicity for different misfolded tau isoforms remains unanswered.Recently, our group identified inhibition of anterograde, kinesin-1-dependent fast axonal transport as a toxic mechanism for disease-related forms of tau (<Kanaan, et al., 2013>). Using the isolated squid axoplasm preparation, this toxic effect of tau was found to be mediated, at least in part, by pathological changes in tau conformation that expose an N-terminal motif termed the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>,<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>). Several modifications promoted aberrant PAD exposure, including phosphorylation, filament formation and oligomerization. The latest is of particular interest because soluble pre-fibrillar tau aggregates appear to represent toxic forms of tau in several tauopathy models, and may play a role in the spreading of tau pathology from cell-to-cell (<Cardenas-Aguayo Mdel, et al., 2014>,<Lewis and Dickson, 2015>,<Ward, et al., 2012>). The PAD in tau is involved in a signaling pathway whereby exposure of PAD activates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which in turn activates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3) via dephosphorylation of serine 9. Active GSK3 phosphorylates kinesin light chains causing cargo dissociation and disruption of fast anterograde axonal transport (FAT) (<Morfini, et al., 2002>). Previously, all studies demonstrating inhibition of axonal transport by pathogenic forms of tau have used the longest 4R tau isoform. Therefore, the question of whether aggregates of all six human isoforms oligomerize, display PAD, and inhibit axonal transport has not been evaluated. Such information would help to identify the extent to which PAD exposure contributes to toxicity in human tauopathies that display pathology comprised of different tau isoforms. In this work, we evaluated levels of PAD exposure, oligomer formation, and axonal transport toxicity for aggregates composed of each of the six human tau isoforms. Six human isoforms of tau protein are created by alternative splicing in the adult CNS (<Fig. 1A>). Inclusion or exclusion of exon 10 creates two isoform categories that contain either 4 or 3 microtubule-binding repeat domains (i.e. 4R or 3R isoforms), respectively (<Wang and Mandelkow, 2016>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_1,"The 4R and 3R isoforms are further divided into three separate isoforms by alternative splicing of two N-terminal exons and contain either both (exons 2 and 3, 2N), one (exon 2, 1N) or zero (neither exon 2, nor exon 3, 0N) of these exons  The isoform containing 2N4R is hT40 (441 amino acids), 1N4R is hT34 (412 amino acids), 0N4R is hT24 (383 amino acids), 2N3R is hT39 (410 amino acids), 1N3R is hT37 (381 amino acids) and 0N3R is hT23 (352 amino acids). All constructs were expressed in E. coli using the pT7c plasmid and each contained a C-terminal 6× histidine tag for purification. DNA sequences were verified by sequencing prior to use in protein production. Recombinant proteins of each isoform were purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin, 635502, Clontech) followed by size exclusion chromatography over an S200 column (26/60, 17-1195-01, GE Healthcare) using methods similar to those described (<Carmel, et al., 1994>,<Carmel, et al., 1996>). Proteins (in 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT) were quantified using an SDS Lowry protein assay.The SDS Lowry was performed by adding BSA protein stock (2 mg/ml, 23209, Thermo Scientific) or unknown, purified tau protein stocks to SDS solution (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8) to a final volume of 100 µl. BSA protein standards of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 µg were used and blank samples without tau protein were used for the tau samples. The proteins were precipitated by adding 1 ml of 10% perchloric acid/1% phosphotungstic acid to each sample and incubated 1 hr on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4° C and the supernatant was removed. After air-drying the protein pellet, it was dissolved in 1 ml of Lowry solution (0.01% CuSO4, 0.02% sodium potassium tartate, and 2% sodium carbonate in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then 100 µl of Folin-Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent (diluted 1:1 in water, F9252, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated for 30–45 minutes at room temperature. Then absorbance at 750 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. Tau protein concentrations were interpolated from the BSA standard curve (linear regression, r2=0.994). The protein was aliquoted into 10–50 µl and frozen at −80°C until used in experiments outlined below. Purified tau protein isoforms were visualized using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (<Fig. 1B>) to confirm protein quality and consistency in protein assay results across the isoforms. It is noteworthy that this specific protein assay is routinely used by our group and produces consistent results in our hands. Tau aggregation was induced with arachidonic acid (ARA; 90010, Cayman Chemical) using methods similar to those previously described (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>). Briefly, recombinant tau (2 µM) was incubated in polymerization buffer (5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6) with 75 µM ARA at room temperature for 6 hours. ARA was stored at –20° C, and working solutions were prepared in 100% ethanol immediately prior to use. To obtain monomeric control samples, tau (2 µM) was prepared in polymerization buffer with ARA vehicle (ethanol), immediately aliquoted and then stored at −80° C. The extent of aggregation was determined using a combination of the right angle laser light scatter (LLS) assay, thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy as described below. A right angle LLS system was used to measure the intensity of scattered light (IS) as described (<Gamblin, et al., 2000>). Briefly, the system was composed of a 475 nm laser (BWI-475-20-E, B&W Tek, Inc.), a high sensitivity CMOS digital camera (DCC1240M, Thor Labs) and imaging software uc480 Viewer version 4.2. Images of scattered light were captured after 6 hours of polymerization at room temperature, a time at which a steady state of polymerization has been reached (<Gamblin, et al., 2000>,<Sarthy and Gamblin, 2006>). Images were analyzed in Photoshop v12.1 (Adobe Systems) using the marquee tool to select a region of interest (75 × 10 pixels) within the scattered light band near the middle of the cuvette. The pre-ARA baseline IS was subtracted from each post-ARA IS measurement. Each experiment was repeated four independent times, and background-corrected intensity of IS was used for comparisons. The formation of β-sheet structures was measured after 6 hours of polymerization at room temperature using a ThS fluorescence assay. A 0.0175% solution of ThS (T1892, Sigma) was prepared on the day of each experiment and cleared through a 0.22 µm filter before use. For each sample, 6 µl of ThS was added to 150 µl of 2 µM monomer or aggregated tau in a black 96-well plate (06–443-2, Fisher Scientific). After 20 minutes incubation at room temperature, fluorescence measurements were made using a Promega GloMax Multi Detection System with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 510–570 nm. Background fluorescence was measured in wells containing tau monomers with ARA vehicle (i.e. ethanol), and subtracted from each respective aggregate condition. Each experiment was repeated four independent times. TEM was used to visualize the morphology of aggregates formed by each isoform after 6 hours of polymerization at room temperature as described (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>). A 10 µl aliquot of each 2 µM monomeric or polymerized tau sample was fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde (tau was 1.6 µM final concentration), spotted onto 300 mesh formvar carbon coated copper grids (FCF300-Cu, Electron Microscopy Sciences), and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined with a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus electron microscope at 80 kV and 10,000× magnification. Images were captured with an AMT XR81 digital camera and AMT software version 602.6 (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). Fresh frozen frontal cortex tissue from non-demented control, PiD, CBD and AD cases (n = 4/group) were obtained from the Brain Bank of the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Northwestern University. For detailed human subject information see <Table S1>. Soluble tau and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions were obtained as described previously (<Kanaan, et al., 2016>). Briefly, tissue pieces (0.5–1 g) were homogenized on ice in ten volumes (1 g = 10 ml) of brain homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin). The soluble tau fraction was collected in the supernatant following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 minutes at 4° C. The following pellet was homogenized in brain pellet homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 800 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF) and centrifuged using same parameters as above. The supernatant was collected, 1% sarkosyl (final concentration) was added, samples were incubated at 37° C for one hour, and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for one hour at 4°C. Then the final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of brain pellet homogenization buffer to obtain the sarkosyl insoluble tau fraction. Both the soluble tau and sarkosyl insoluble tau fractions were assayed for total protein concentration using the SDS Lowry protein assay and stored at −80°C until used in sandwich ELISAs for analysis (see below). Four tau antibodies were used in this study to characterize aggregates composed of each tau isoform. The Tau5 antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1, Binder/Kanaan Lab) recognizes aa 210–230 (<Carmel, et al., 1996>) and is unaffected by phosphorylation or conformation. The TNT1 antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1, Binder/Kanaan Lab) was made against PAD (i.e. amino acids 2–18, epitope between 7–12) and is a useful marker of PAD exposure in non-denaturing assays (<Combs, et al., 2016>,<Kanaan, et al., 2016>,<Kanaan, et al., 2012>). The TOC1 antibody (mouse monoclonal IgM, Binder/Kanaan Lab) has an epitope between 209–224 and selectively recognizes oligomeric tau aggregates, compared to monomeric or filamentous aggregates (<Patterson, et al., 2011a>,<Ward, et al., 2013>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_2,"The R1 antibody (Binder Lab) is a rabbit polyclonal pan-tau antibody with numerous epitopes throughout the tau protein (<Berry, et al , 2004>). Sandwich ELISAs were used to measure the relative levels of total tau, PAD-exposed tau and oligomeric tau in recombinant tau protein samples and tau isolated from the frontal cortex of human brains (<Kanaan, et al., 2016>). All steps were performed at room temperature. Wells were washed between each step using 200 µl/well of ELISA wash buffer (100 mM borate acid, 25 mM sodium borate, 75 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM thimerosal, 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20), and 50 µl solution/well was used for all other steps.For sandwich ELISAs with recombinant tau samples, Tau5 (2 mg/ml), TNT1 (2 µg/ml) or TOC1 (2 µg/ml) capture antibodies were diluted in borate saline (100 mM borate acid, 25 mM sodium borate, 75 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM thimerosal) and applied at 50 µl/well to coat high-binding 96-well microplates (catalog #07-200-35, Fisher Scientific) for 60 minutes. Plates were washed twice with ELISA wash buffer, and then blocked for 60 minutes with ELISA wash containing 5% non-fat dry milk (block solution). Two washes were performed and then recombinant tau samples were added to each well for 90 minutes. Tau monomers or aggregates from the in vitro polymerization assays were diluted with polymerization buffer to a final concentration of 5 nM (Tau5 assays), 100 nM (TNT1 assays) or 150 nM (TOC1 assay). Titer assays for each version of the sandwich ELISA were performed to ensure assays were within the linear range. Wells were rinsed 3 times and then incubated with R1 diluted 1:20,000 (50 ng/ml) in block solution for 90 minutes, to serve as the detection antibody. Wells were washed 3 times, and then incubated for 60 minutes with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; PI-2000, Vector Labs) diluted in block solution. Wells were washed 3 times, and assays were developed using 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; T0440, Sigma) for 20 minutes (Tau5 and TNT1 assays) or 35 minutes (TOC1 assay). The reactions were stopped with 3.5% sulfuric acid and absorbance was read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The amount of total tau applied in the assay was known and equivalent between groups since purified recombinant protein samples were used, but absorbance (A) is not linear (i.e. A = Log10(1/transmittance)) and not useful for comparing across samples. Thus, the absorbance data were converted to percent absorbed light (a linear scale) using the following equation %A = (1–10−x)*100, where x is absorbance. Since R1 is a polyclonal anti-tau antibody, the percent light absorbed data from the TNT1 and TOC1 assays were normalized to the data from the Tau5 assays (i.e. total tau levels) to account for any R1-based detection variations with different tau isoforms. The normalized data were used for statistical comparisons across groups.The same protocol was used to measure the levels of total tau, PAD exposure and tau oligomers in soluble and sarkosyl insoluble tau fractions of the frontal cortex from control, PiD, CBD and AD brains (n = 4/group; <Table S1>). All steps were identical with the exception that human brain samples were used. The samples were diluted to a final total protein concentration of 0.4 µg/µl (i.e. 20 µg/well) for soluble tau fractions or 0.08 µg/ml (i.e. 4 µg/well) for insoluble tau fractions. The protein amount was determined in titer experiments to ensure the ELISAs were performed within the linear rage. Tau standard ELISAs were performed simultaneously with human sample sandwich ELISAs to estimate the amount of tau captured by Tau 5, TNT1 or TOC1 and detected with R1. A serial dilution of recombinant hT40 monomer (ranging from 250–1.0 ng/well) was bound to the ELISA plate for 60 minutes, then blocked as above, and detection was performed using R1 and then the HRP-secondary antibody exactly as in the sandwich ELISAs. Each standard was run in duplicate and developed simultaneously with the sandwich ELISAs to ensure accurate interpolation of unknown tau amounts. The standard curve data were log10 transformed and best fit to a sigmoidal curve (r2 = 0.998). This provided a standard curve of absorbance values that were derived from R1 reactivity with known amounts of tau protein. The quantity of tau (ng) in each human sample was interpolated from the tau standard curves and then converted to a concentration of ng/µl by dividing the interpolated quantity by the volume of the sample used (i.e., 50 µl). Finally, the data (i.e. concentrations of tau) were normalized to reduce skewness using logarithmic transformations and then used for statistical comparisons. Monomeric and aggregated tau samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 6% glycerol (v/v). 1.6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (v/v), 0.85% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.002% Bromophenol blue (v/v)), incubated at 90°C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Criterion TGX precast gels (5671094, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to 0.22 µm nitrocellulose membranes (66485, Pall Corporation, Pensacola, FL). Membranes were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubated overnight at 4° C in Tau5 (1:100,000), TNT1 (1:300,000), or TOC1 (1:5,000). Membranes were rinsed in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and developed with the goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) IRDye 680LT secondary antibody (1:20,000; 926–68020, LiCor) for TNT1 blots, or goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) IRDye 800LT secondary antibody (1:20,000; 926–68020, LiCor) for Tau5 and goat anti-mouse IgM IRDye 680LT secondary antibody (1:20,000; 926–68080, LiCor) for TOC1 blots. Image acquisition and intensity measurements were performed using a LiCor Odyssey system.To confirm the preferential involvement of specific tau isoforms in different tauopathy pathologies, the insoluble tau fractions were processed for isoform identification on western blots. Samples of sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions (50 εl) were solubilized in a 6 M guanidine-HCl for 1.5 hrs at room temperature and then dialyzed (3500 Da cutoff, #69550, Pierce) against TBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4° C. The resultant samples were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid for 2 hrs on ice, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4° C for 30 min. The pellets were washed with −20° C acetone, centrifuged again at 14,000 × g for 20 min and air-dried prior to resuspending in 40 µl of 1X FastAP Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 0.02% Triton X-100 and 100 µg/ml BSA), then sonicated, and then dephosphorylated by adding 4 µl FastAP thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase (#EF0651, Thermo Scientific) and incubating at 37° C for 1.5 hr. After dephosphorylation, 20 µl of 6× Laemmli sample buffer was added and the samples were prepared as above for separation on 10% TGX criterion gels (#5671033, BioRad) and transferred to nitrocellulose as above. Due to proteolytic processing of the termini of tau proteins within inclusions in tauopathies, we probed the membranes simultaneously with a combination of monoclonal mouse IgG1 antibodies with epitopes covering the protein: Tau13 is an N-terminal monoclonal antibody (epitope between aa8-9/13-21; (<Combs, et al., 2016>)), Tau5 is a mid-tau monoclonal antibody (epitope between aa210–230; (<Carmel, et al., 1996>)) and Tau7 is a C-terminal monoclonal antibody (epitope between aa 430–441; (<Horowitz, et al., 2006>)). The signal was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG1 IRDye 680LT secondary antibody (1:20,000; 926–68050, LiCor) and imaged as above. Fast axonal transport (FAT) was measured in freshly extruded squid axoplasm (Loligo pealii; Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA) as previously described (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>,<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>). Recombinant tau samples (monomer or aggregate) were diluted in X/2 buffer (175 mM potassium aspartate, 65 mM taurine, 35 mM betaine, 25 mM glycine, 10 mM HEPES, 6.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5mM glucose, 10mM adenosine triphosphate, pH 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_3,"2) and perfused into isolated axoplasm at a final concentration of 2 µM (physiological range of tau) (<Alonso, et al , 1996>,<King, et al., 1999>). Motility was analyzed using a Zeiss Axiomat microscope equipped with a 100× (1.3 numerical aperture) objective and differential interference contrast optics. Images were acquired using a Model C2400 CCD through a Hamamatsu Argus 20 and further process using a Hamamatsu Photonics Microscopy C2117 video manipulator for image adjustment and generation of calibrated cursors and scale bars. The rate of anterograde and retrograde FAT was measured by matching calibrated cursor movements to the speed of vesicles moving in the axoplasm over 50 min and data were plotted as a function of time (<Song, et al., 2016>). The average velocity of transport over the last 20 min of the assay was compared between monomer and aggregates of each isoform. Triple-label IF was used to characterize the co-localization between PAD exposure (TNT1), oligomers (TOC1) and total tau pathology (R1). Importantly, the sections were fixed with paraformaldehyde, a small molecule cross-linker, that does not readily disrupt protein structure (<Mason and O'Leary, 1991>,<Rait, et al., 2004>) and the fixed, free-floating sections were not exposed to denaturants (e.g., heat or alcohols), in order to allow conformational differences to remain intact in the tissue sections. Tissue sections from age-matched, non-demented controls (n = 3), CBD (n = 4), PiD (n = 4) and AD cases (n = 3; <Table S1>) were processed for triple-label IF using the TNT1 (mouse IgG1), TOC1 (mouse IgM) and R1 (rabbit) antibodies according to published methods (<Kanaan, et al., 2016>). The sections were incubated overnight at 4° C in a primary antibody solution containing TNT1 (1:30,000), TOC1 (1:2,000) and R1 (1:2,500) antibodies followed by incubation in a secondary antibody solution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1-specific (A-21121, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgM-specific (A-21043, Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit specific (A-21244, Invitrogen) antibodies (all diluted 1:500) for 2 hours. Following the staining procedure, sections were mounted on microscope slides, autofluorescence was blocked using 2% sudan black and the sections were coverslipped using hardset Vectashield mountant. Control sections with one of the three primary antibodies omitted confirmed that each secondary label was specific to the appropriate primary antibody (i.e. no staining was observed with the fluorophore for the omitted antibody; <Fig. S1A–L>). A Nikon A1+ laser scanning confocal microscope system equipped with solid-state lasers (488, 561, and 640) and Nikon Elements AR software were used to acquire image z-stacks (0.5 µm step size), and the images (maximum intensity projections) were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. All experiments were repeated at least three independent times. The data were assessed for meeting normality and equal variance assumptions using the D’Agostino-Pearson normality test and the Brown-Forsythe variance test, and when both were not met the data were analyzed using nonparametric statistical tests (as indicated below). In the recombinant tau protein experiments, normality tests were run by combining the 4R monomers (n =12), 4R aggregates (n = 12), 3R monomers (n = 12) and 3R aggregates (n=12) to obtain large enough sample sizes for better measuring normality. The human brain lysate data were log transformed to normalize the data as described above. Experiments were analyzed by Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test, with a one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, or with a two-way ANOVA as indicated in the results and figure legends. When overall significance was achieved, the Holm-Sidak post-hoc test (for ANOVAs) or the Dunn post-hoc test (for Kruskal-Wallis) was used to make all possible comparisons. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. All tests were two-tailed, and significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., LaJolla, CA, USA) was used for all statistical tests. Recombinant proteins corresponding to all tau isoforms were expressed in bacteria (<Fig. 1B>) and induced to aggregate in vitro at near physiological levels (i.e., 2 µM) using ARA (<Alonso, et al., 1996>,<King, et al., 1999>). Three well-established assays were used to measure the extent of tau isoform aggregation. Right angle laser light scattering showed significantly greater scattered light intensity in all 4R tau isoforms when compared to 3R isoforms (one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(5, 18) = 60.22, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 2A>). hT40 showed the highest amount of light scattering compared to other 4R isoforms, and there were no differences between the different 3R isoforms. Similar results were seen in the ThS assay, where the 4R isoforms were significantly higher than 3R isoforms (one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(5, 18) = 19.99, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 2B>), and no differences were found in comparisons between the individual 4R isoforms or between the 3R isoforms. Interestingly, 4R tau isoforms formed morphologically distinct aggregates compared to 3R isoforms (<Fig. 2C–H>). A mixture of long, intermediate and short filaments, as well as globular oligomers were present in 4R isoform reactions (<Fig. 2C–E>). In contrast, 3R isoforms were primarily composed of globular oligomers and only very rare long filaments were found (<Fig. 2F–H>). Monomer samples were imaged to confirm the lack of aggregation, and as expected, the grids did not contain any aggregates (data not shown). Non-denaturing sandwich ELISAs (<Kanaan, et al., 2016>) were used to determine the levels of PAD exposure (TNT1 reactivity) in the isoform samples (<Fig. 3A>). The monomer groups were not normally distributed and did not display equal variance, thus nonparametric tests were used for comparisons including monomers. Comparisons between isoform monomers showed that hT39 monomer signal was significantly higher than hT24 and hT23 monomers (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post-hoc, H = 18.4, p = 0.0025). The hT24 aggregates showed the highest TNT1 signal, which reached significance compared to hT40, hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates (one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(5, 18) = 19.11, p < 0.0001). Aggregates of all six tau isoforms showed significant increases in TNT1 reactivity when compared to their respective monomer samples (<Fig. 3A>; Mann-Whitney test, for all comparisons p = 0.029).Sandwich ELISAs were used to determine the levels of tau oligomers (TOC1 reactivity) in the isoform samples (<Fig. 3B>). The monomer groups were not normally distributed and did not display equal variance, thus nonparametric tests were used for comparisons including monomers. Comparisons between isoform monomers showed that hT39 monomer signal was significantly higher than hT24 and hT23 monomers (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post-hoc, H = 18.6, p = 0.0023). The hT24 aggregates showed the highest TOC1 signal, which reached significance compared to hT40, hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates, while hT34 aggregates were significantly different from hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates, and both hT40 and hT39 aggregates are significantly higher than hT37 and hT23 (one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(5, 18) = 50.77, p < 0.0001). Aggregated samples for all six isoforms showed significant increases in TOC1 reactivity when compared to their respective monomer samples (<Fig. 3B>; Mann-Whitney tests, for all comparisons p = 0.029).The same samples were denatured and run in SDS-PAGE and western blotting to confirm that the differences TNT1 and TOC1 reactivity were conformation-dependent. As expected, monomer and aggregated samples of all six tau isoforms showed equal reactivity for TNT1 and TOC1 when the samples were denatured because this exposes the epitopes making them equally accessible (Student’s t-tests, for all comparisons p > 0.05; <Fig. 3C–H>). The effect of isoform-specific tau aggregates on fast axonal transport was evaluated using the isolated squid axoplasm model system as in our prior studies (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>,<Kanaan, et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_4,", 2011>,<LaPointe, et al , 2009>). The anterograde FAT data were compared using a two-way ANOVA and overall significance was achieved for both factors (tau isoforms: F(5,36) = 4.487, p = 0.003; and tau species: F(1,36) = 66.21, p < 0.0001), but not the interaction (F(5,36) = 0.859, p = 0.518). Perfusion of hT40, hT34 and hT24 aggregates into squid axoplasms significantly impaired anterograde transport (<Fig. 4A>) when compared to the respective monomers (all at 2 µM). Similarly, perfusion of squid axoplasms with hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates significantly impaired anterograde FAT (<Fig. 4A>) when compared to the respective monomers (all at 2 µM). Pairwise comparisons within tau species showed that hT24 aggregates produced significantly more inhibition of anterograde FAT when compared to hT34 and hT39 aggregates. The retrograde FAT data were compared using a two-way ANOVA and overall significance was achieved for tau species (F(1,36) = 23.68, p <0.0001), but not for tau isoforms (F(5,36) = 2.269, p = 0.068) or the interaction (F(5,36) = 0.582, p = 0.714). hT40, hT34, hT24, hT37 and hT23 aggregates did not significantly impair retrograde FAT when compared to the respective monomers, but hT39 aggregates elicited a mild inhibitory effect on retrograde FAT (<Fig. 4B>). However, this effect appeared due to a slightly higher retrograde rate for hT39 monomer rather than a lower retrograde rate with hT39 aggregates. Plots of fast axonal transport rates over time of squid axoplasms incubated with monomeric and aggregated forms of each tau isoform are provided in <Supplementary Figure 2>. Collectively, these studies indicate that inhibition of anterograde FAT represents a toxic effect common to all tau aggregates, regardless of isoform composition. Tissue sections from tauopathy cases were stained using multi-label immunofluorescence for TNT1 (PAD exposure), TOC1 (tau oligomers) and R1 (pan-tau marker) to confirm whether these modifications coexist in multiple tauopathies with pathologies spanning all of the tau isoforms. Cognitively unimpaired Braak stage I-II cases were used to establish whether these modifications coexist in the early stages of tau pathology deposition. Indeed, early pre-tangle neurons within the hippocampus were labeled with all antibodies in Braak I-II cases (<Fig. 5A–D>). In severe AD cases (i.e. Braak stage V-VI), all markers continue to colocalize in classic NFTs within the hippocampus that characterize AD tau pathology (<Fig. 5E–H>). In CBD, the characteristic astrocytic pathology (e.g. astrocytic plaques) showed extensive co-localization between TNT1, TOC1 and R1 in the frontal cortex (<Fig. 5I–L>). Similarly, the characteristic Pick bodies in the frontal cortex were well labeled by TNT1, TOC1 and R1 in PiD tissue (<Fig. 5M–P>). While the amount of overlap was extremely high in all cases, there were a small number of examples in which immunoreactivity for the two epitopes could be seen separately. In general, the remarkable co-localization between TNT1, TOC1 and R1 in all tauopathies confirms that PAD exposure and tau oligomerization occur simultaneously in cells displaying tau pathology, irrespective of isoform composition.We confirmed the isoform composition of pathology in the human tauopathy lysate samples using the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions. The AD, PiD and CBD samples were solubilized in guanidine and dephosphorylated prior to running in western blots (<Fig. 6A>). The band patterns in the immunoblots showed that the AD cases contained a mixture of isoforms, the PiD cases clearly contained 3R isoforms but also some 4R isoforms, while the vast majority of pathology in CBD cases were comprised of 4R tau isoforms. A recombinant protein standard containing all six human tau isoforms was run simultaneously to confirm that each isoform band was appropriately identified in the human samples.Sandwich ELISAs were used to further evaluate whether there are differences in tau oligomerization and PAD exposure specifically between AD, CBD and PiD cases. Total tau levels in the soluble fractions were similar for AD, CBD and PiD, as indicated by the Tau5 sandwich ELISA (<Fig. 6B>; one-way ANOVA, F(2,9) = 3.283, p = 0.085). In contrast, AD soluble tau displayed the highest level of TNT1 followed by CBD, with PiD having the lowest levels (<Fig. 6C>; one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(2,9) = 24.87, p = 0.0002). Similarly, the soluble fraction from AD contained the greatest level of TOC1 reactivity, followed by CBD and then PiD had the lowest signal (<Fig. 6D>; one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(2,9) = 16.57, p = 0.001). As a point of reference, the levels of total tau, TOC1 and TNT1 for ND control cases are provided as dashed line (data not shown). Total tau levels in the insoluble fractions, as detected by Tau5, were highest in AD, followed by CBD and PiD contained the least (<Fig. 6E>; one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(2,9) = 25.93, p = 0.0002). TNT1 detected significantly more PAD exposed tau in AD compared to PiD, and more in CBD when compared to PiD, but AD and CBD were not different (<Fig. 6F>; one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(2,9) = 12.07, p = 0.0028). TOC1 detected significantly more oligomeric tau in AD compared to CBD and PiD and more in CBD compared to PiD (<Fig. 6G>; one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc, F(2,9) = 35.32, p < 0.0001). These data complement our findings from the immunofluorescence studies using fixed tissue sections (<Fig. 5>), and further support the co-occurrence of tau oligomerization and PAD exposure in AD, CBD and PiD. The involvement of different tau isoforms in several unrelated tauopathies is well established, but mechanisms linking different isoforms to cell degeneration have not been established. Based on our prior work, we set out to establish the extent of oligomer formation (as measured by TOC1 immunoreactivity, (<Patterson, et al., 2011a>,<Ward, et al., 2013>)) and conformational display of PAD (as measured by TNT1 reactivity, (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>,<Kanaan, et al., 2011>)) in aggregates composed of each human tau isoform. In addition, we tested whether tau aggregates of each isoform are toxic to FAT in the squid axoplasm assay (<Song, et al., 2016>). Results from biochemical assays indicated that aggregation increased oligomer formation and PAD exposure for all tau isoforms. The degree of these conformational changes was greater for 4R isoform aggregates, when compared to 3R isoforms. Importantly, aggregates of all six isoforms significantly impaired anterograde FAT, thus extending prior findings from experiments using the longest 4R tau isoform (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>,<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>). Although the longest 3R isoform (hT39) was found to impair retrograde FAT slightly, a finding not seen with any other unmodified tau construct evaluated to date (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>,<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>,<Morfini, et al., 2007>,<Patterson, et al., 2011a>), and while this may be due to a slight increase in retrograde rates with monomeric hT39 we recently found that pseudophosphorylated Ser 422 tau aggregates also impair retrograde FAT through an unknown mechanism (<Tiernan, et al., 2016>). Either way, this is intriguing and may merit further characterization. Highlighting the relevance of these observations to human disease, we showed oligomer formation and PAD exposure occur in multiple tauopathies (i.e., AD, CBD and PiD) that involve various combinations of the tau isoforms. Conformational changes in the tau protein are considered to be exceptionally important in the formation of pathological inclusions and toxic effects of tau proteins in human tauopathies. Pathological conformations thought to facilitate the aggregation of tau were originally identified when conformation-specific antibodies, such as Alz50 and MC1, were characterized as having discontinuous epitopes (<Carmel, et al., 1996>,<Hyman, et al., 1988>,<Jicha, et al., 1999>,<Jicha, et al., 1997>). The recent development of tau antibodies that detect PAD exposure (<Combs, et al., 2016>,<Kanaan, et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_5,", 2011>) or oligomeric species (<Castillo-Carranza, et al , 2014b>,<Lasagna-Reeves, et al., 2012>,<Patterson, et al., 2011a>,<Ward, et al., 2013>) has facilitated additional insight into the pathological conformations adopted by tau. More recently, we showed that several disease-related modifications of tau cause conformational display of the PAD in the amino terminus of tau and oligomeric tau aggregates impaired axonal transport confirming a link between pathological conformations and tau toxicity (<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>,<Patterson, et al., 2011a>,<Patterson, et al., 2011b>,<Tiernan, et al., 2016>). Moreover, many other studies suggest oligomeric tau is toxic to neurons in culture and in vivo (<Castillo-Carranza, et al., 2014a>,<Castillo-Carranza, et al., 2014b>,<Fa, et al., 2016>,<Gerson, et al., 2016>,<Lasagna-Reeves, et al., 2010>,<Tian, et al., 2013>,<Usenovic, et al., 2015>). Previous studies have focused only on the longest 4R tau isoform to study the effects of PAD exposure and oligomerization. Here, we extended those studies to all six human tau isoforms in the CNS. Despite some differences in the morphology of aggregates, PAD exposure and oligomerization occurred with all six human tau isoforms when aggregated in vitro.The measurements of aggregation for each isoform are in general agreement with previous studies assessing tau isoform aggregation with arachidonic acid-induced polymerization (<Combs, et al., 2011>,<King, et al., 2000>,<Voss and Gamblin, 2009>). Visual inspection of the aggregates using electron microscopy showed that the morphology of aggregates with different isoforms were quite distinct. Our data further support this conclusion by showing that there are differences in the reactivity with conformation-dependent antibodies (TNT1 and TOC1) among the recombinant tau isoform aggregates and tauopathy aggregates. Our recombinant protein data showed greater reactivity with both TNT1 and TOC1 for the 4R isoforms compared to 3R isoforms and the shortest 4R isoforms showed the greatest signal among the 4R proteins, while the opposite was true for 3R isoforms. We confirmed that the differences in TNT1 and TOC1 reactivity were dependent upon conformation because when the samples are assayed under denaturing conditions equal reactivity was observed. The varying levels of reactivity for TNT1 and TOC1 and obvious morphological difference among tau isoform aggregates, suggest there are likely structural differences not identified by electron microscopy. Moreover, there appears to be a relationship between TNT1 and TOC1 reactivity in non-denaturing assays with the tau isoform aggregates, although it is likely that a single monoclonal antibody may not be able to equally detect all conformational structures associated with different tau species, as previously suggested for other oligomeric antibodies (<Kayed, et al., 2010>,<Rasool, et al., 2013>).Interestingly, the ultrastructural morphology of tau filaments in the tauopathies display some distinct features (<Crowther, 1990>,<Crowther and Goedert, 2000>) that suggest structural differences exist between aggregates composed of different tau isoforms in human disease. Our data support this conclusion because, while PAD exposure and oligomer formation was observed in AD (4R and 3R pathology), CBD (4R pathology) and PiD (3R pathology), the extent of signal was lowest in PiD in the biochemical assays. Interestingly, the fact that our human PiD cases contained some 4R isoforms suggests that these potential structural differences may not be entirely isoform-specific, but are also dependent upon still unknown disease-specific factors. The presence of PAD exposure and oligomerization in all of these tauopathies is further supported by the extensive co-localization observed between TNT1 and TOC1 in AD, CBD and PiD. The diversity of tau inclusions suggests that different processes may dictate the formation of tau inclusions in each tauopathy, but unfortunately these mechanisms remain unidentified. Nonetheless, oligomer formation and PAD exposure may elicit toxicity to transport in all of these tauopathies.It is important to note that the fixation and staining methods used in the human tissue studies here should leave tau conformations intact allowing TNT1 and TOC1 to label the pathological conformations. Previous studies suggest that formaldehyde fixation does not significantly alter secondary and tertiary conformations in proteins (<Mason and O'Leary, 1991>,<Rait, et al., 2004>). We have recently shown that N-terminal tau antibodies (e.g., Tau13 and Tau12) with epitopes immediately downstream of TNT1 robustly label parenchymal tau (i.e., normal tau) as well as tau inclusions, demonstrating that they do not distinguish between normal and pathological tau conformations in tissue sections (<Combs, et al., 2016>). In contrast, TNT1 and TOC1 are specific to pathological inclusions and do not label parenchymal tau, further suggesting that conformational differences remain in fixed human tissue samples (<Combs, et al., 2016>,<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<Patterson, et al., 2011a>,<Ward, et al., 2013>).The hT39 monomers showed a significant increase in TNT1 and TOC1 reactivity unlike other 3R isoform monomers. Perhaps this signifies inherent structural or folding differences in the longest 3R isoform compared to other isoforms. It is also noteworthy that a non-significant increase in TNT1 and TOC1 reactivity was also observed with hT40 monomers, again suggesting the longest 4R isoform may exhibit a greater tendency for TNT1 and TOC1 epitope display. There is clear evidence that several tau conformations can form dynamically and it seems likely that the protein may normally shift between folded global conformations and “unfolded” states as a soluble monomer (<Jeganathan, et al., 2008>,<Mukrasch, et al., 2009>). Thus, it is not entirely surprising that both TNT1 and TOC1 show low levels of reactivity with monomers of the longest isoforms when abundant amounts of the proteins are analyzed.Importantly, we and others have suggested that tau post-translational modifications regulate tau folding in situ, and that disease-related modifications like abnormal phosphorylation and/or aggregation may enhance aberrant PAD exposure and could prevent tau from returning to a regulatable, monomeric state. While these potential regulatory events are not well understood, phosphorylation is important in modulating tau conformations. Previous studies have shown that pseudophosphorylation at the AT8 site alters tau folding (<Jeganathan, et al., 2008>) and significantly impairs anterograde FAT as a monomeric protein (<Kanaan, et al., 2011>), and more recently we found that pseudophosphorylation at Ser 422 similarly impairs anterograde transport as a monomer and is toxic to retrograde transport when aggregated (<Tiernan, et al., 2016>). Conversely, phosphorylation of tyrosine 18 within PAD appears to mitigate the deleterious effects of pathological forms of tau (<Kanaan, et al., 2012>), and might be involved in the normal regulation of PAD-dependent effects on transport (<Kanaan, et al., 2015>). Axonal transport is a cellular process critical for the maintenance of neural connectivity and impairment in transport is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies (<Morfini, et al., 2009>). Dystrophic neurites, synaptic loss, and protein mislocalization are pathological features in tauopathies, and evidence of FAT impairments (e.g., axonal swellings, synaptic loss, and impaired vesicle transport) is present in several tauopathy animal models (<Gotz, et al., 2006>,<Kanaan, et al., 2013>,<Morfini, et al., 2009>). Recently, our group described a mechanism by which physiological levels of hT40 tau with PAD exposed (e.g. aggregates and other disease-related modifications) caused inhibition of kinesin-dependent anterograde FAT (<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>). Once hT40 PAD is abnormally exposed, it triggers a PP1/GSK3 signaling pathway that leads to kinesin phosphorylation and cargo detachment (<Morfini, et al., 2004>,<Morfini, et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_6,", 2002>)  Until now, it was unclear whether other tau isoforms would similarly inhibit anterograde FAT upon aggregation.To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that aggregates of all six tau isoforms produced axonal transport toxicity. Interestingly, some inter-isoform differences were noted. Specifically, hT24 aggregates, the shortest 4R isoform, produced the most robust inhibition of anterograde FAT, and showed the highest level of TNT1 and TOC1 reactivity. Based on the structural differences described above, these findings suggest that aggregates composed of the shortest 4R tau isoform are structurally arranged to expose PAD more readily than other isoform aggregates, which would explain the increased toxicity and transport impairment. Despite such differences, it is important to emphasize that all isoform aggregates produced significant inhibition of anterograde transport. These data indicate that this PAD-dependent toxic mechanism (<Kanaan, et al., 2011>,<LaPointe, et al., 2009>) is relevant for multiple tauopathies irrespective of the isoforms composing the pathological inclusions.A great deal of focus has been placed on whether monomers, oligomers, filaments or various forms of all these tau species are toxic (<Lasagna-Reeves, et al., 2011>,<Sahara, et al., 2008>,<Sahara, et al., 2014>,<Ward, et al., 2012>). Indeed, multiple studies implicate oligomers as a primary toxic species of tau in several tauopathy model systems (<Cardenas-Aguayo Mdel, et al., 2014>,<Castillo-Carranza, et al., 2014a>,<Fa, et al., 2016>,<Gerson, et al., 2016>,<Lewis and Dickson, 2015>,<Sahara, et al., 2013>,<Tian, et al., 2013>,<Usenovic, et al., 2015>,<Ward, et al., 2012>). Here, the vast majority of aggregates produced by the 3R isoforms under the experimental conditions used were oligomeric, with only rare filaments being present in the sample. These samples significantly impaired transport suggesting oligomeric species are sufficient for transport inhibition. This is consistent with previous work showing that Hsp70 binds with tau oligomers (only the hT40 isoform was studied), not tau filaments. Furthermore, Hsp70 blocked the deleterious effects of hT40 tau aggregates consisting of both oligomers and filaments on axonal transport suggesting that tau oligomers are responsible for the inhibitory effect (<Patterson, et al., 2011b>). However, these studies do not rule out potential toxicity from modified monomers and/or filaments, which will require further investigation.Another interesting difference between specific human tauopathies is the diversity of cell types that are affected and contain tau inclusions. For example, AD and PiD primarily involve neuronal inclusions (<Braak, et al., 2006>,<Delacourte, et al., 1996>), while other tauopathies such as PSP and CBD involve several forms of glial inclusions (<Berry, et al., 2004>,<Buee Scherrer, et al., 1996>,<Dickson, 1999>) and yet others such as CTE are characterized by a mixture of neuronal and glia inclusions (<McKee, et al., 2014>). Here, we provide evidence for a common tau-mediated toxic mechanism for all six isoforms involving impairment of microtubule-based anterograde transport (plus-end directed, kinesin-based). The role of axonal transport in maintaining neuron connectivity and survival is well established (<Kevenaar and Hoogenraad, 2015>,<Maday, et al., 2014>), and the importance of microtubule-based transport extends to both the somatodendritic compartment and glial cells (<Baas, et al., 2016>,<Kreft, et al., 2009>). Indeed, microtubule-based transport is widely involved in intracellular trafficking for several cellular components including trafficking of myelin components in oligodendrocytes (<Carson, et al., 1997>,<Lyons, et al., 2009>). Moreover, tau-induced astrocyte toxicity was associated with impaired kinesin-dependent transport (<Yoshiyama, et al., 2003>). Thus, the findings here may have implications for potential mechanisms of toxicity within both neurons and glial cells in tauopathies of unrelated etiology. The diversity in human tauopathy diseases is poorly understood, but one central difference is the isoform composition of the pathognomonic inclusions. Until now, the identity of common features that would explain how each isoform contributes to disease pathogenesis remained unknown. However, our data suggest a model where aggregation-dependent PAD exposure and transport inhibition represent a common toxic mechanism relevant to all human tau isoforms. Under this model, cell type-specific differences in tau isoform expression and aggregation, may explain at least in part the differential vulnerability of cells observed in different tauopathies. These findings provide a novel mechanistic basis linking the aggregation process in all tau isoforms to a specific conformational change (i.e. PAD exposure) and a common toxic effect on transport and other cell processes affected by PP1/GSK3 signaling. This provides a basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for all tauopathies based on blocking or reducing PAD exposure. rhetorical Fig. 1 Schematic of six human tau isoform proteins expressed in the adult central nervous system. (A) Each naturally occurring tau isoform is generated through alternative splicing of exons 2 (yellow), 3 (green) and 10 (within the 2nd microtubule binding regions (MTBR)). Each isoform contains the PAD epitope (red) corresponding to amino acids 2–18 and the tau oligomeric complex epitope (blue) mapped to amino acids 209–224 on hT40. There are 3 isoforms with 4 MTBRs, one with E2 and E3 (hT40, 2N4R, 441 amino acids), E2 and not E3 (hT34, 1N4R, 412 amino acids), and one with neither E2 nor E3 (ht24, 0N4R, 383 amino acids). There are 3 isoforms with 3 MTBRs, one with E2 and E3 (hT39, 2N4R, 410 amino acids), E2 and not E3 (hT37, 1N4R, 381 amino acids), and one with neither E2 nor E3 (ht23, 0N4R, 352 amino acids). (B) Each recombinant tau isoform protein was run in SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie to show each protein (3 µg/lane) and demonstrate equivalent amounts of each protein used in our preparations. rhetorical Fig. 2 Characterization of 4R and 3R isoform aggregation induced by arachidonic acid in vitro. (A) After 6 hours of polymerization, scattered laser light signal (Is) from all three 4R isoforms is significantly greater than the 3R isoforms. Among the 4R isoforms, hT40 signal was significantly higher than hT34 and hT24, and within the 3R isoforms, all 3R constructs produced similar light scattering (one-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post-hoc comparisons: **p < 0.05 vs. hT40 all other groups and *p < 0.05 vs. all 3R isoforms, n = 4/group). (B) Thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence, a marker for β-sheet structures in aggregated tau, was significantly higher in all 4R tau isoforms compared to each 3R isoform. No differences were found between the different 4R or between the different 3R tau isoforms (one-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post-hoc comparisons: *p < 0.05 vs. all 3R isoforms, n = 4/group). All graphed values represent mean ± SEM. (C–H) Representative electron micrographs of hT40 (C), hT34 (D), hT24 (E), hT39 (F), hT37 (G) and hT23 (H) aggregates polymerized in the presence of arachidonic acid. The 4R tau isoforms formed a range of short, intermediate and longer filaments compared to 3R tau isoforms, which formed mostly globular oligomeric aggregates and only rare filaments. Scale bar = 600 nm (applies to all panels). rhetorical Fig. 3 Biochemical analysis of PAD exposure and oligomerization for all tau isoforms. (A and B) Sandwich ELISAs were used as non-denaturing assays to capture PAD exposed tau (A, TNT1 capture antibody) and tau oligomers (B, TOC1 capture antibody), with detection of captured tau using the rabbit pan-tau antibody, R1. (A) The TNT1 ELISAs show significantly higher signal in aggregated samples compared to monomeric samples for each tau isoform. TNT1 signal was highest in hT24 aggregates, which reached significance compared to hT40, hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates. hT40, hT34 and hT39 aggregates were significantly higher when compared to hT37 and hT23 aggregates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5075521_7,"hT39 monomers were significantly different compared to hT34, hT24, hT37 and hT23 monomers  (B) Similarly, the TOC1 ELISAs show significantly higher signal in aggregated samples compared to monomeric samples for each tau isoform. TOC1 signal was highest in hT24 aggregates, which reached significance when compared to hT40, hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates. hT40 and hT39 aggregates were significantly greater than hT37 and hT23 aggregates, while hT34 aggregates were significantly higher when compared hT39, hT37 and hT23. hT39 monomers were significantly different compared to hT24, hT37 and hT23 monomers. The data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn post-hoc (isoform monomers), oneway ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc (isoform aggregates) and the Mann-Whitney test (monomers vs aggregates). *p < 0.05 vs. the monomer of the same isoform; **p < 0.05 vs. hT37 and hT23 aggregates; ***p < 0.05 vs. hT40, hT39, hT37 and hT23 aggregates; #p < 0.05 vs. hT24 and hT23 monomers..(C–H) The same samples that were used for sandwich ELISAs were analyzed using SDS-PAGE/western blotting as a denaturing assay (5 ml of 2 mM sample loaded in each lane). In TNT1 and TOC1 blots, the monomer and aggregate samples produced equal signal (Tau5 was used to normalize TNT1 and TOC1 signals, Student’s t-test, all p > 0.05) because denaturation of the proteins exposes the epitopes making them equally accessible. Collectively, these data indicate that all tau isoforms have PAD exposed and form oligomers when induced to aggregate in vitro, and TNT1 and TOC1 strongly label aggregated forms of all tau isoforms, not monomers, in a conformation-dependent manner. rhetorical Fig. 4 Aggregates of all 6 tau isoforms significantly inhibit anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT) in the isolated squid axoplasm. (A,B) Squid axoplasms were perfused with each tau isoform (2 mM) in monomeric or aggregated forms, and fast axonal transport rates in both anterograde and retrograde directions measured. (A) Quantification of average anterograde FAT rates during the last 20 minutes of the squid axoplasm assay indicate that aggregated forms of all 6 tau isoforms significantly inhibit anterograde FAT when compared to monomeric proteins. The strongest inhibitory effect was seen with hT24 aggregates, which reached statistical significance compared to hT34 and hT39 aggregates. (B) hT40, hT34, hT24, hT37 and hT23 aggregates did not significantly impair retrograde FAT when compared to monomers of the same isoform. Interestingly, hT39 aggregates caused a mild inhibition of retrograde FAT, compared to hT39 monomers, an effect not been observed with any other tau construct tested to date. All differences between groups were compared using a two-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak post-hoc test (*p ≤ 0.05). rhetorical Fig. 5 PAD exposure and tau oligomer formation occur simultaneously in the pathognomonic pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Pick’s disease (PiD). (A–P) Triple label immunofluorescence for TNT1 (green), TOC1 (red) and R1 (blue) was used to determine the extent of colocalization between PAD-exposed tau (TNT1 reactivity) and tau oligomers (TOC1 reactivity), and total tau (R1 reactivity). (A–D) Staining confirmed that PAD exposure and tau oligomerization are present in the same neurons in early pre-tangle neurons (arrow) in nondemented Braak stage I-II cases. Despite a high degree of overlap between TNT1 and TOC1, occasional inclusions were TNT1 reactive but lacked TOC1 reactivity (arrowheads). (E–H) Both PAD exposed tau and tau oligomers remain highly colocalized in late AD brains (Braak stage V-VI) with both markers continuing to label classic neurofibrillary tangles. It is notable that occasional inclusions do not show strong colocalization between TNT1 and TOC1 (arrowheads) suggesting these events are not always concurrent. (I–L) PAD exposure and tau oligomerization are present in the astrocytic inclusions characteristic of CBD in the frontal cortex (glial plaque identified with dashed outline). Again, some discrete glial threads appeared to contain a low level of TNT1 and TOC1 colocalization (arrowheads) indicating that PAD exposure and oligomerization are not always linked in CBD. (M–P) Pick bodies show robust labeling and colocalization with TNT1 and TOC1 in the frontal cortex of PiD brains (arrows). Occasionally, some inclusions were not double stained with TNT1 and TOC1 (arrowheads) suggesting that in PiD these modifications are not always co-distributed. All scale bars are 50 mm. rhetorical Fig. 6 Immunochemical analysis of tau isoforms, PAD exposure and oligomerization in the frontal cortex of PiD, CBD and AD brains. (A) Immunoblots of the dephosphorylated, sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from the AD, PiD and CBD cases displaying the isoform composition. AD cases show a mixture of isoforms, the PiD cases clearly contain 3R isoforms, but also some 4R isoforms, while the vast majority of pathology in CBD cases 4R tau isoforms. A recombinant protein (Rec Tau) standard containing all six tau isoforms was run to confirm each isoform band. (B–D) Sandwich ELISAs were used to quantify the level of total tau (B, Tau5 capture), PAD exposed tau (C, TNT1 capture) or tau oligomers (D, TOC1 capture) in soluble protein fractions. (B) As expected, the soluble fraction contained equal levels of tau proteins in all groups. (C,D) The level of PAD exposed tau (C) and oligomeric tau (D) was the highest in AD cases, followed CBD cases and the lowest level among the tauopathies was in PiD. The dashed lined represents the average signal from ND control cases and is included as a reference point for “normal” levels in all graphs. (E–G) Sandwich ELISAs were also used to quantify the level of total tau (E, Tau5 capture), PAD exposed tau (F, TNT1 capture) or tau oligomers (G, TOC1 capture) in the sarkosyl insoluble fractions. (E) The sarkosyl insoluble fraction contained significantly more total tau in AD compared to CBD and PiD, and CBD had more than PiD. (F) Significantly more PAD exposed tau was found in AD and CBD when compared to PiD. (G) The amount of oligomeric tau proteins in AD was the highest, and CBD cases contained were significantly higher levels compared to PiD. ELISA values represent the average level of tau (ng/ml) ± SEM (n = 4/group) and the data were compared using a oneway ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc test (*p < 0.05). Misfolded tau proteins are characteristic of tauopathies, but the isoform composition of tau inclusions varies by tauopathy. Using aggregates of the longest tau isoform (containing four microtubule-binding repeats, 4-repeat tau), we recently described a direct mechanism of toxicity that involves exposure of the N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) in tau, which triggers a signaling pathway that disrupts axonal transport. However, the impact of aggregation on PAD exposure for other tau isoforms was unexplored. Here, results from immunochemical assays indicate that aggregation-induced increases in PAD exposure and oligomerization are common features among all tau isoforms. The extent of PAD exposure and oligomerization was larger for tau aggregates composed of 4-repeat isoforms compared to those made of 3-repeat isoforms. Importantly, aggregates of all isoforms exhibited enough PAD exposure to significantly impair axonal transport in the squid axoplasm. We also show that PAD exposure and oligomerization represent common pathological characteristics in multiple tauopathies. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism of toxicity common to each tau isoform that likely contributes to degeneration in different tauopathies. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4258165_0,"Clinical and basic science research suggests that stress and/or changes in central stress signaling intermediates may be involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Although the links between stress and AD remain unsettled, data from our group and others have established that stress exposure in rodents may confer susceptibility to AD pathology by inducing hippocampal tau phosphorylation (tau-P). Work in our lab has shown that stress-induced tau-P requires activation of the type-1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1). CRF overexpressing (CRF-OE) mice are a model of chronic stress that display cognitive impairment at 9–10 month of age. In this study we used 6–7 month old CRF-OE mice to examine whether sustained exposure to CRF and stress steroids would impact hippocampal tau-P and kinase activity in the presence or absence of the CRFR1-specific antagonist, R121919, given daily for 30 days. CRF-OE mice had significantly elevated tau-P compared to wild type (WT) mice at the AT8 (S202/T204), PHF-1 (S396/404), S262, and S422 sites. Treating CRF-OE mice with R121919 blocked phosphorylation at the AT8 (S202/T204) and PHF-1 (S396/404) sites, but not at the S262 and S422 sites and reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun N Terminal Kinase (JNK). Examination of hippocampal extracts from CRF-OE mice at the ultrastructural level revealed negatively stained round/globular aggregates that were positively labeled by PHF-1. These data suggest critical roles for CRF and CRFR1 in tau-P and aggregation and may have implications for the development of AD cognitive decline.

YT is in receipt of the senior Career Scientist Award from Veteran Administration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by extensive cell loss, the accumulation of senile plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The incidence of NFT is positively correlated with cognitive deficits and neuronal loss in AD [<1>, <2>]. Tau is a soluble phospho-protein that stabilizes microtubules, plays a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal structure, polarity, transport, and exists in multiple isoforms (six in humans, four in mice) produced from a single gene [<3>]. Whereas tau is phosphorylated at 2–3 moles/mole of protein under basal conditions, tau from the AD brain is hyperphosphorylated at a 7–10 molar ratio [<4>, <5>] and at least 25 distinct sites [<6>, <7>]. Although information is known about the general role of tau in AD, the precise consequences of tau phosphorylation (tau-P) have been difficult to determine. A leading hypothesis in the field postulates that phosphorylation reduces the ability of tau to bind and stabilize microtubules and leads to tau aggregation and formation of paired helical filaments, which comprise NFT [<8>–<10>]. Several studies demonstrate that exposure to acute physiological and emotional stress paradigms induces reversible hippocampal tau-P in rodents (for review, [<11>]), a process that, at least in the case of emotional stress, is reliant on signaling through the type-1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1) [<12>, <13>]. Our previous data demonstrate that exposure to chronic/repeated emotional stress leads to cumulative effects on tau-P and its sequestration to detergent-soluble cellular fractions of mice hippocampus [<12>, <14>].Constitutive overexpression of CRF (CRF-OE) in mice is considered a valid animal model of chronic stress [<15>, <16>]. CRF-OE mice display significant brain atrophy at 3–6 months of age [<17>] and show hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits when tested at 9 months of age [<18>]. Furthermore, studies using CRF-OE mice have found increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau compared with wild-type littermates [<19>]. Although published data with stress and/or CRF-OE suggest that stress steroids are not required for stress-induced tau-P [<12>, <19>, <20>], the circuitry involved is unknown and whether sustained levels of CRF can induce tau-P via CRFR1 in the absence of environmental stress is uncertain. In the present study, we used CRF-OE mice to examine the impact of sustained exposure to CRF on hippocampal tau-P at several AD-relevant sites (S262, S422, S202/T205 (AT8), and S396/404 (PHF-1). To identify the potential role of CRFR1 in facilitating tau-P, we compared groups of CRF-OE mice treated for 30 days with vehicle or the CRFR1 antagonist, R121919 (NBI 30775) [<21>]. As described previously, CRF-OE mice were originally generated with a chimeric CRF transgene composed of the rat genomic CRF gene replacing the 5′ regulatory region by a mouse metallothionein-1 promoter that was microinjected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs (C57/B6 × SJL) [<15>, <22>]; CRF over-expression has been confirmed through administration of CRF antagonists [<16>]. CRF-OE mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Experiments were conducted in adult (6–7 months old) female CRF-OE mice (n = 20) and age-matched wild type (WT) female littermates (n = 10). Mice were housed (2–4/cage) with ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent diet and water in a temperature controlled room (22°C) with a 12 h light-dark cycle. The University of California, San Diego’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental protocols. CRF-OE mice received daily subcutaneous (sc) injections either the CRFR1 antagonist, R121919 at 20 mg/kg (gift of Dr. K. Rice, NIH) (n = 10), or drug vehicle (n = 10) for 30 days leading up to euthanasia. The dose of 20 mg/kg/d was based on our previous studies in mice with R121919 and stress-induced tauP [<12>, <14>]. R121919 was dissolved in 0.3% tartaric acid and 5% v/v polyethoxylated castor oil. Both R121919 and vehicle solution were vortexed and sonicated immediately before use. The volume of daily sc injection was 0.1 mL. Several well-characterized antibodies were used to detect phosphorylated forms of tau and major tau kinases. For western blots, S202/T205 (1 : 500; AT8; Pierce Biotechnology), S262, S422 (1 : 1000; Biosource, Camarillo, CA), and S396/404 (1 : 1000; PHF-1; gift from Dr. P. Davies, Albert Einstein, NY), were selected based on their ability to reveal target bands at the appropriate molecular weight for phosphorylated tau (~50–75 kDa). Antibodies against S199, T212, T231, and S409 sites were tested but were found either to target only high-molecular weight proteins (>100 kDa) (S199, T231) or have no signal (T212, S409) and were therefore excluded from the analysis. For assessment of tau kinases, antibodies to phosphorylation sites or activator proteins were also used: activated GSK-3β (pY216; 1 : 1000; BD Transduction), inactive GSK-3β (pS9; 1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5; 1 : 1000; EMD Biosciences), cdk5 activator proteins, p25 and p35 (1 : 1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK; 1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology), mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, 1 : 500; Cell Signaling Technology). Total protein levels of GSK-3 (GSK-3β; 1 : 2500; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), JNK, CDK-5, and ERKS (Cell Signaling Technology) were measured. Beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control for protein loading for each blot. Due to the propensity of anesthesia to impact tau phosphorylation (e.g., [<23>]), mice (n = 4 for each group) were euthanized by cervical dislocation 24 h after the last injection of R121919, then perfused through the ascending aorta with 0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4258165_1,"9% saline and brains were removed  Left side hemibrains were drop fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h and then cryopotected overnight in 20% sucrose-phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The next morning, 30 μm-thick sections were cut on a freezing-sliding microtome and stored at −20°C in cryoprotectant solution, containing 20% glycerol and 30% ethylene glycol in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Before immunostaining, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 0.3% H2O2. After incubating in PHF-1 primary antibody for 48 h at 4°C, sections were incubated in biotinylated anti-mouse antibody followed by avidin-biotin complex. Reaction product was developed using a nickel-enhanced DAB reaction [<24>]. Antibody specificity for phosphorylated mouse tau was confirmed previously by pretreating sections from mice exposed to 30 min restraint stress with alkaline phosphatase (40 mg/ml), which eliminated immunoreactivity [<12>]. The hippocampus from each animal was rapidly dissected from the right hemisphere and immediately homogenized in detergent-containing radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free (Thermo Scientific), as previously described [<12>–<14>, <25>]. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). 6 μg of protein was loaded and electrophoretically separated on a bis-tris polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane and incubated in primary antibody followed by HRP-linked secondary antibodies and developed with a chemiluminescence western blot detection kit (Pierce Supersignal). All blots were then stripped with stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific) and probed for actin (1 : 1000, Sigma), which served as a loading control. Background subtraction was performed and quantitative band intensity readings were obtained using NIH ImageJ software. All data were then normalized to WT controls, with all western blot data presented as a percent change in intensity relative to WT controls. RIPA fractions were also examined by immuno-gold electron microscopy to assess whether structural changes in hippocampal tau occur as a function of CRF-OE in the presence or absence of R121919. RIPA extracts were postfixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, treated with osmium tetraoxide, embedded in epon araldite and sectioned with an ultramicrotome (Leica, Germany). Grids were analyzed with a Zeiss OM 10 electron microscope as previously described [<26>]. For immunogold labeling, sections were mounted on nickel grids, etched and incubated with PHF-1 antibody followed by gold-tagged antibodies against mouse IgG1 (10 nm Aurion ImmunoGold particles) (1 : 50, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) and silver enhancement. Optical density readings from western blots were analyzed using either one- or two-way (genotype x treatment) ANOVA using Prism 6 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data were plotted on histograms, and expressed as mean ± SEM percentage of control values. For the epitopes that had no signal in WT animals, OD readings are presented. Vehicle-treated CRF-OE mice had a widespread profile of tau-P protein expression in the hippocampus (<Fig. 1A>), with significantly increased tau-P at all sites tested compared to WT controls (all p < 0.05). In particular, AT8, PHF-1, and S422 were 350%, 350%, and 170% (respectively) greater in CRF-OE mice than their WT counterparts (<Fig. 1B, C>). Of interest, tauP at the S262 site, which was not observed in WT, was observed in CRF-OE although at a modest level (OD = 1.25) in comparison to other epitopes (<Fig. 1C>). This suggests that tau-P at S262 may be directly due to the overexpression of CRF in this model. Treatment for 30 days with R121919 (CRF-OE + antag) completely prevented the rise in tau-P at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites in CRF-OE mice (p < 0.05 each) as shown by the levels of phosphorylation at these two sites not significantly different between R121919 treated CRF-OE mice and WT counterparts (AT8, p = 0.17; PHF-1, p = 0.25, <Fig. 1B>). By contrast, levels at the S262 and S422 sites were unchanged by R121919 pretreatment (p > 0.05, <Fig. 1C>). These results demonstrate that overexpression of CRF can induce tau-P in the hippocampus, a process that requires CRFR1 for specific sites but not others.To investigate the localization of tau-P responses, we used immunohistochemical methods to examine PHF-1 reactivity in the hippocampus of CRF-OE mice and its CRFR1 dependence. The detection of immunolabeling was consistent with biochemical data in showing a prominent increase in tau-P staining in CRF-OE mice that was blocked by treatment with R121919 (<Fig. 2>). Hippocampal PHF-1 labeling in CRF-OE was restricted to Ammon’s horn, with stained perikarya scattered throughout the stratum oriens and pyramidale of CA1 and CA2 subregions. Relatively fewer PHF-1 positive cells were observed in stratum radiatum shown in <Fig. 2A>. Other prevailing features included bands of axonal staining in stratum laconosum-moleculare. CRF-OE mice treated with drug (CRF-OE + R121919) had no cellular labeling in any region of the hippocampus shown in <Fig. 2B>. We observed low levels of discernible cell or fiber labeling in CA3, hilus, or dentate gyrus as shown in <Fig. 2C>. Similar to that seen in CRF-OE mice, CRF-OE treated with R121919 had no discrete labeling in CA3, hilus, or dentate gyrus (<Fig. 2D>). We did, however, observe persistence in fiber immunoreactivity within white matter tracts of the alveus, which appeared weaker in intensity compared to vehicle treated CRF-OE mice. PHF-1 immunoreactivity in the white matter of mice has been seen previously (R. A. Rissman and P.E Sawchenko, unpublished observations), though whether this labeling is specific or represents an artifact due to fixation is uncertain. White matter labeling was observed to varying degrees in both WT and CRF-OE mice with a localization primarily restricted to the alveus and dorsal portions of corpus callosum. No immunoreactivity was observed in the lateral or ventral aspects or splenium of the corpus callosum or in motor nuclei or tracts and no obvious preference was seen in immunoreactivity with proximity to ventricular or pial surfaces (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that CRFR1 blockade reduces hippocampal tau-P to WT levels in CRF-OE at select phosphorylation sites, N-terminal to the microtubule binding domain (AT8, S202/T205) and at the C-terminus (PHF-1, S396/404). Based on these results and that reported by others with CRF-OE mice [<19>], we hypothesized that differential modulation of kinases by CRFR1 existed in this context. We therefore used antibodies directed to active and inactive states of kinases implicated in tau-P at the epitopes examined to determine which kinases were altered in the hippocampus of CRF-OE treated with vehicle or R121919. Compared to WT cohorts, CRF-OE mice displayed significantly increased phosphorylation levels of GSK-3β, MapK P38 and ERK1/2 kinases (all p < 0.05 compared to WT), but not JNK (p = 0.12) (<Fig. 3>). Levels of CDK5 activator protein, p35, were robustly upregulated in CRF-OE but the p35-truncated protein, p25 was not observed. Levels of total GSK-3, ERK1/2, and CDK5 were unchanged in CRF-OE mice regardless of treatment with R121919 (all p > 0.05, data not shown). Although several of the kinases examined are implicated in tau-P at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites shown in <Fig. 3A>, we found only levels of activated JNK to be sensitive R121919 pretreatment (p < 0.05) (<Fig. 3A, C>). These findings suggest that induction of tau-P via JNK activation is central to tau-P at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites in CRF-OE mice. To examine the functional consequences of increased tau-P and its regulation by R121919 in CRF-OE mice, we used immunogold electron microscopy techniques. We used detergent-soluble hippocampal extracts generated for biochemical studies to examine whether structural changes occur as a consequence of chronically elevated tau-P. We found negatively stained round/globular aggregates (~50 nm diameter) (<Fig. 4A>, left panel) with a density as high as 10/μm2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4258165_2,"These aggregates were not present in mice that received R121919 (<Fig  4A>, right panel). Extracts from CRF-OE mice had aggregates that were positive for PHF-1 immunogold labeling (<Fig. 4B>, both panels). An average of 3–6 gold particles were seen per aggregate. CRF-OE mice treated with R121919 had no immunogold signal (data not shown). Although requiring confirmation and extension, our findings may represent evidence of pre-pathologic hippocampal tau aggregates, in vivo. In the present study, we examined the status of hippocampal tau-P in the presence or absence of CRFR1 antagonism in CRF-OE mice aged 6–7 month, a time point demonstrated to be prior to the onset of reported hippocampal memory deficits (9 months) [<18>]. Our data provide evidence of increased hippocampal levels of active tau kinases, increased tau-P and detectable aggregates of tau in detergent-soluble cellular fractions. We also demonstrate that administration of CRFR1 antagonist results in a reduction of tau-P to levels seen in WT controls and prevents the formation of observed globular tau aggregates. The aggregates we identified in CRF-OE mice are very similar in size and shape to that which we have seen in mice exposed to repeated stress (cf, [<14>]), and are similar to that seen in in vitro studies with truncated tau species (e.g., [<27>]). In addition to the possibility of CRF overexpression inducing tau truncation, given the granular appearance of our aggregates, these inclusions may be tau oligomers which have been reported in AD mice and in humans with AD [<28>–<32>]. Because our previously published [<14>] and current data appear to be the first to report aggregated structures of tau with purely WT murine tau, additional studies are needed to determine the precise nature of these inclusions. Our findings also suggest that although increased tau-P is present at several AD-relevant tau epitopes in CRF-OE mice, phosphorylation at S202/T205 and S396/404 sites via increased GSK 3β activity is regulated directly through CRF-CRFR1 signaling in the mouse hippocampus. Stress exposure and/or exposure to stress peptides can impact learning, memory, and hippocampal morphology and function in animals models [<33>–<36>]. Although CRF is best known as the hypothalamic neuropeptide that governs the endocrine stress response [<37>], its distribution and actions in the CNS suggest a broad involvement in integrating hormonal, autonomic, and behavioral adaptations [<38>–<41>]. Supporting the hypothesis of broader central involvement, studies have found prominent changes in CRF in AD, particularly in brain regions vulnerable to AD neuropathology [<11>, <42>, <43>]. In addition to CRF itself, considerable attention has been focused on effectors of the stress cascade, such as glucocorticoids, as mediators of neuronal vulnerability in AD. Increased circulating levels of these hormones in aging have been linked to brain atrophy and a range of adverse effects in the hippocampus [<36>, <44>–<46>]. Stress disorders, such as depression, are very common in AD patients, which are thought to mechanistically involve alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (reviewed in [<47>]). Whether stress and/or depression can be considered preclinical or prodromal risk factors for AD is still a matter of debate. The stress response can be initiated by the two primary categories of physical or emotional stressors. They are recognized and distinguished by their differential sensory modalities that register the challenges and patterns of neuronal activity they induce, and thereby mediate adaptive responses and the extent to which they invoke affective responses [<48>–<50>]. Regardless of the salience or strength of the stressors, they induce consistent increased tau-P expression in the hippocampus [<11>]. In terms of epitopes examined, our analysis of the published literature revealed no stark difference in the induction of tau-P between physical and emotional stressors. Acute challenges generally yielded readily reversible increases in tauP (range, minutes-hours) [<12>, <23>, <51>–<55>], while more chronic paradigms lead to longer lasting effects (days) [<12>, <56>–<59>]. In particular, there is evidence of relatively widespread phosphorylation at various sites, with robust changes seen consistently at the S202/T205 (AT8) and S396/404 (PHF-1) phosphorylation sites [<11>, <12>, <14>, <60>]. In the studies that examined them, few, if any, changes have been seen in the phosphorylatable amino acids between the PHF-1 site (S396/404) and S422 [<11>, <14>, <61>], except at S413 in the starvation model [<58>]. Likewise, with the exception of glucoprivation [<57>], small or no changes have been seen in the S262 site with stress exposure [<11>, <14>] which is consistent with our findings in CRF-OE mice. In terms of kinases, nearly all studies implicate GSK-3β in the induction of tau-P (reviewed in [<11>]). We also observed increased phosphorylation of tyrosine 216 of GSK-3β in CRF-OE mice, however only JNK activity was sensitive to CRFR1 antagonism and resulted in ablation of phosphorylation increases at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites (<Fig. 3>). Interestingly, we observed relationships between JNK phosphorylation and tau phosphorylation at AT8 and PHF-1 in WT mice. R121919 treatment diminished tau-P responses at both AT8 and PHF-1 sites, presumably via JNK but yet under WT conditions, elevated JNK only resulted in observed increased basal levels of AT8. JNK phosphorylation and tau-P at AT8 sites may be due to acute stress exposure occurring during handling/sacrifice or be involved in tau-P seen in the white matter that we have observed. Inconsistent relationships between tau-P and upstream kinases have been reported previously [<51>], and the mediating entities and mechanisms underlying this selective regulation are unresolved and require further investigation. We previously reported that restraint stress-induced tau-P was dependent on signaling through CRFR1 [<12>]. To bypass the neuronal circuitries activated by various stressors, we examined whether chronic elevation in CRF occurring without stress exposure could result in tau-P and its dependence on CRFRs. Several aspects of our analysis warrant further consideration. First, CRF-OE mice treated with R121919, a selective CRFR1 antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier [<19>], displayed dramatic reduction in tau-P at two of four sites and in activating phosphorylation of one kinase. The role of CRFR1 as the primary signaling pathway involved in regulating hippocampal tau-P is further supported by the expression of CRFR1 as the dominant receptor subtype expressed in the mouse hippocampus [<62>] and by our previous findings showing that increased hippocampal tau-p induced by an acute stress is mediated by CRFR1 [<12>, <14>]. CRFR2 actions, if relevant here, may occur outside the hippocampus because CRFR2 is expressed at low level in the mice hippocampus [<55>]. In the mouse hippocampus there is paucity of CRFR2 ligands in hippocampal afferents. However, extrinsic CRF inputs to hippocampus have not been described, leaving local interneurons and the CSF as possible sources of CRF to hippocampal CRFR1 [<63>, <64>]. Second, we cannot fully parse out the role of chronically elevated corticosterone in this CRF-OE expressing mice [<15>]. CRFR1 activation is associated with initiation of the endocrine stress response and CRF-OE mice display high circulating levels of corticosterone [<37>, <38>]. However as we allude to above, it is our hypothesis that stress-induced tau-P is a phenomenon associated with local CRF circuitry in the hippocampus. Our contention is supported by data from our lab and others demonstrating that stress-associated increases in glucocorticoids are not required for either physical or psychological stress-induced tau-P [<12>, <20>]. Our preliminary studies exploring the impact of prolonged corticosterone also support these findings. We treated groups of WT mice subcutaneously with corticosterone (5–25 mg) for 21-days and observed no obvious increase in tau-P in the hippocampus compared to placebo-treated mice (R.A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4258165_3,"Rissman, unpublished observations)  Although requiring verification and extension, data thus far suggest that glucocorticoids may not be integral for tau-P responses. Consistent reports indicate that exposure to a range of stressors induce reversible tau-P at many AD-relevant sites (reviewed in [<11>]). Some studies propose that stress-induced tau-P is a functional component of neuroplasticity, conferring adaptation to stressful stimuli [<56>, <59>], while our group and others suggest that the relationship between stress and tau-P may also define a potential means by which chronic stress exposure may translate into neuropathology [<12>, <51>, <54>, <55>, <57>]. Our present and previous experimental studies demonstrating chronic elevations in tau-P with altered tau solubility under conditions of chronic CRF expression and repeated stress are supportive of this hypothesis, as well as clinical evidence with AD patients demonstrating high levels of distress proneness [<65>–<67>]. Collectively it therefore seems plausible that stress-induced tau-P is an essential process required for stress adaptation that becomes dysfunctional with advancing age and/or with chronic overstimulation. Although the phenomenology is certainly distinct, a similar case can be made for toxicity associated with Aβ. Aβ may be present throughout life, but with advancing age the ability to process the fragments may become reduced or lost, leading to accumulation. Although the mechanisms involved remain to be determined, our data suggest a possible underpinning for evidence relating chronic stress to memory impairment and tau pathology, which may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for AD. rhetorical Fig. 1 Increased tau-P in CRF-OE mice and involvement of CRFR1.

Clinical and basic science research suggests that stress and/or changes in central stress signaling intermediates may be involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Although the links between stress and AD remain unsettled, data from our group and others have established that stress exposure in rodents may confer susceptibility to AD pathology by inducing hippocampal tau phosphorylation (tau-P). Work in our lab has shown that stress-induced tau-P requires activation of the type-1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1). CRF overexpressing (CRF-OE) mice are a model of chronic stress that display cognitive impairment at 9–10 month of age. In this study we used 6–7 month old CRF-OE mice to examine whether sustained exposure to CRF and stress steroids would impact hippocampal tau-P and kinase activity in the presence or absence of the CRFR1-specific antagonist, R121919, given daily for 30 days. CRF-OE mice had significantly elevated tau-P compared to wild type (WT) mice at the AT8 (S202/T204), PHF-1 (S396/404), S262, and S422 sites. Treating CRF-OE mice with R121919 blocked phosphorylation at the AT8 (S202/T204) and PHF-1 (S396/404) sites, but not at the S262 and S422 sites and reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun N Terminal Kinase (JNK). Examination of hippocampal extracts from CRF-OE mice at the ultrastructural level revealed negatively stained round/globular aggregates that were positively labeled by PHF-1. These data suggest critical roles for CRF and CRFR1 in tau-P and aggregation and may have implications for the development of AD cognitive decline. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5653760_0,"The formation of paired helical filaments (PHF), which are composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein dissociating from microtubules, is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The most important phosphatase that is capable of dephosphorylating Tau at AD specific phospho-sites is protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A). Here we show that resveratrol, a polyphenol, significantly induces PP2A activity and reduces Tau phosphorylation at PP2A-dependent epitopes. The increase in PP2A activity is caused by decreased expression of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitin-specific modification and degradation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A when bound to microtubules. Interestingly, we further show that MID1 expression is elevated in AD tissue. Our data suggest a key role of MID1 in the pathology of AD and related tauopathies. Together with previous studies showing that resveratrol reduces β-amyloid toxicity they also give evidence of a promising role for resveratrol in the prophylaxis and therapy of AD.

This work was in part supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF-TRP-233-B18). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the most prominent neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging. One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is the development of paired helical filaments (PHFs) in the patients’ brains. PHFs have also been observed in AD-related tauopathies. Basis of PHFs is hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that, in a normo-phosphorylated status, associates with and stabilizes microtubules. Upon hyper-phosphorylation, Tau dissociates from the microtubules, sequesters normal Tau and other microtubule-associated proteins and thereby depolymerizes microtubules<1>,<2>.Tau is differentially phosphorylated at over 30 sites in AD brains compared to normal. While several kinases including CDK5 and GSK3β are responsible for the phosphorylation of Tau, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the major phosphatase of Tau in the brain<3>. Interestingly, reduction of both expression and activity of PP2A has been described in brains of AD patients repeatedly<4>–<8>. This makes PP2A activity an interesting target for the development of a therapy for AD and related tauopathies.A promising starting point for the development of PP2A-effective substances in the therapy of AD is its degradation process. We have shown previously that the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) and its regulatory α4 subunit interact with the microtubule-associated ubiquitin ligase MID1. After complex formation MID1 mediates the ubiquitin-specific modification of PP2Ac and its degradation by the proteasome, thereby providing a highly specific microtubule-centred regulation mode for PP2A<9>. Substances interfering with this interaction are interesting candidates for mediating an increase in microtubule-specific PP2A activity.Resveratrol is a polyphenol that can be extracted from different plants including grapes and peanuts and is found particularly in red wine. It is sold as food additive in pharmacies and drug stores and has a very broad biological activity. Cardioprotective, anti-cancerogenic, as well as anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects have been described<10>–<12>. Furthermore, resveratrol is more and more being established as a neuroprotective drug after ischemic brain injury and in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s Disease<13>,<14>, AD<15>,<16> and Huntington’s Disease<17>,<18>.Mechanisms of action of resveratrol are numerous and largely unknown. However, it has been shown that resveratrol has anti-oxidant activity<19>,<20>, inhibits cycloxygenase activity<21>,<22>, ribonucleotide reductase<23>, protein kinase C<24>, DNA polymerase <25> and has antiestrogenic properties<26>,<27> and anti-platelet activity. Furthermore, it activates Sirt1, an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase<28>,<29> and also has been demonstrated to activate AMP kinase (AMPK)<30>,<31>, an important glucose sensor that inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby increasing oxidation of fatty acids and decreasing their synthesis.Here we show that resveratrol treatment directly interferes with the MID1-α4-PP2A degradation complex by reducing MID1 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. This leads to an increase of microtubule-associated PP2A activity and a time- and dose-dependent dephosphorylation of Tau. Our data provide evidence for a promising effect of the polyphenol resveratrol in AD and related tauopathies. As PP2Ac constitutes the catalytic subunit of the most important Tau-phosphatase, inhibition of its degradation trigger, namely the MID1-α4 complex, offers promising possibilities to find novel treatment options for AD. In an AlphaScreen protein-protein interaction assay with the aim to identify disruptors of the MID1-α4 interaction we noted that the polyphenol resveratrol disrupts this interaction in vitro with an IC50 in the submillimolar range (Fig. <1a>). To further validate that resveratrol has an influence on the MID1-α4 interaction we co-expressed FLAG-tagged MID1 and V5-tagged α4 in HEK293T cells. Cell lysates were then used for co-immunoprecipitation using V5-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with or without resveratrol, washed, and analysed by western blot.

In line with the data from the AlphaScreen co-precipitation of MID1 and α4 was clearly reduced after in vitro resveratrol treatment (Fig. <1b>). We then treated different cell lines with 100 µM resveratrol for 20 hours and tested for alterations in the MID1 complex and concomitant increases in PP2Ac. In several cell lines only weak effects could be observed, probably because potential changes in the MID1-affected microtubules-associated fraction of PP2Ac were obscured by the bulk cellular PP2Ac levels (data not shown). However, markedly increased levels of PP2Ac could be observed in a HEK293 derivative cell line (HEK293-β2a) when treated with resveratrol (Fig. <1c>). This was accompanied by significantly reduced expression levels of the MID1 protein. In line overexpression of MID1 reduced PP2Ac levels significantly and also affected phosphorylation of the PP2A-target protein S6K (Fig. <1d>).Two possible scenarios could result in a reduction of MID1 protein expression after resveratrol treatment: (I) resveratrol could affect MID1 protein stability, or (II) resveratrol could affect the MID1 mRNA. To investigate the mechanism underlying the reduction of MID1 on both mRNA and protein level, we performed a time-course experiment with resveratrol in a time frame of 0 to 6 hours and quantified both the MID1 protein expression on western blots and the MID1 mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR. While after treatment with resveratrol MID1 protein and mRNA levels decreased, reduction rate of the MID1 protein was significantly faster than the reduction rate of the MID1 mRNA after resveratrol treatment (Fig. <1e,f>). These data suggest that resveratrol affects the MID1 protein first, while the MID1 mRNA gets reduced as a secondary event. To test if resveratrol affects MID1 protein stability in a proteasome-dependent manner, HEK293T cells were co-treated with resveratrol and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in a time-course experiment. Strikingly, inhibition of the proteasome blocked the reduction of MID1 after resveratrol treatment, indicating that disassembly of the MID1-α4 complex by resveratrol induces proteasomal degradation of MID1 (Fig. <1g>). In line with an increased degradation of MID1 after resveratrol treatment, treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not affect MID1 protein level after 1–2 hours of treatment nor did it further decrease MID1 levels upon double-treatment with resveratrol and cycloheximide (Fig. <1h>).The next question was how resveratrol, if it first affects MID1 protein level, leads to the secondary reduction of the MID1 mRNA after longer incubation times. As we had shown previously MID1 is an RNA binding protein binding its own mRNA through its 3′-UTR<32>. We therefore hypothesized that the MID1 protein has a stabilizing effect on its own mRNA through binding to its 3′-UTR. To show this the MID1 3′-UTR from base 2406–3697 (NM_000381.3) was cloned downstream of the stop codon of renilla luciferase. For normalization, firefly luciferase was expressed on the same plasmid from a different promoter. This construct was co-transfected with either non-silencing control or MID1 specific siRNAs directed against the coding region of MID1. These siRNAs target endogenous MID1 without affecting the renilla-MID1-3′-UTR construct. Upon depletion of endogenous MID1, a significant reduction of the expression of the MID1-3′-UTR-luciferase construct was observed (Fig. <1i>), while the control construct without the MID1-3′-UTR was not affected by MID1 knockdown. These data suggest that MID1 indeed stabilizes its own mRNA by interacting with its 3′-UTR.In summary, these data suggest a mechanism in which resveratrol stimulates PP2A activity by targeting the MID1 protein towards degradation via the proteasome. MID1 stabilizes its own mRNA. Dissociation of the MID1-PP2Ac complex leads to the proteasomal degradation of the MID1 protein followed by destabilization of its mRNA. Thereby, reduced expression of the ubiquitin ligase MID1 results in the stabilization of microtubule-associated PP2Ac (Fig. <2a>). rhetorical Figure 2 Resveratrol reduces the MID1 transcript and protein level in neurons. (a) Schematic showing the effect of resveratrol on MID1. Left: MID1 is a ubiquitin ligase that catalyses the ubiquitination of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) and thereby stimulates proteasomal degradation of microtubule-associated PP2Ac. MID1 binds to and stabilizes its own mRNA. Right: Resveratrol treatment induces the proteasomal degradation of MID1, which stabilizes and activates PP2A at the microtubules.

PMC5653760_2,"In several cell lines only weak effects could be observed, probably because potential changes in the MID1-affected microtubules-associated fraction of PP2Ac were obscured by the bulk cellular PP2Ac levels (data not shown)  However, markedly increased levels of PP2Ac could be observed in a HEK293 derivative cell line (HEK293-β2a) when treated with resveratrol (Fig. <1c>). This was accompanied by significantly reduced expression levels of the MID1 protein. In line overexpression of MID1 reduced PP2Ac levels significantly and also affected phosphorylation of the PP2A-target protein S6K (Fig. <1d>).Two possible scenarios could result in a reduction of MID1 protein expression after resveratrol treatment: (I) resveratrol could affect MID1 protein stability, or (II) resveratrol could affect the MID1 mRNA. To investigate the mechanism underlying the reduction of MID1 on both mRNA and protein level, we performed a time-course experiment with resveratrol in a time frame of 0 to 6 hours and quantified both the MID1 protein expression on western blots and the MID1 mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR. While after treatment with resveratrol MID1 protein and mRNA levels decreased, reduction rate of the MID1 protein was significantly faster than the reduction rate of the MID1 mRNA after resveratrol treatment (Fig. <1e,f>). These data suggest that resveratrol affects the MID1 protein first, while the MID1 mRNA gets reduced as a secondary event. To test if resveratrol affects MID1 protein stability in a proteasome-dependent manner, HEK293T cells were co-treated with resveratrol and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in a time-course experiment. Strikingly, inhibition of the proteasome blocked the reduction of MID1 after resveratrol treatment, indicating that disassembly of the MID1-α4 complex by resveratrol induces proteasomal degradation of MID1 (Fig. <1g>). In line with an increased degradation of MID1 after resveratrol treatment, treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not affect MID1 protein level after 1–2 hours of treatment nor did it further decrease MID1 levels upon double-treatment with resveratrol and cycloheximide (Fig. <1h>).The next question was how resveratrol, if it first affects MID1 protein level, leads to the secondary reduction of the MID1 mRNA after longer incubation times. As we had shown previously MID1 is an RNA binding protein binding its own mRNA through its 3′-UTR<32>. We therefore hypothesized that the MID1 protein has a stabilizing effect on its own mRNA through binding to its 3′-UTR. To show this the MID1 3′-UTR from base 2406–3697 (NM_000381.3) was cloned downstream of the stop codon of renilla luciferase. For normalization, firefly luciferase was expressed on the same plasmid from a different promoter. This construct was co-transfected with either non-silencing control or MID1 specific siRNAs directed against the coding region of MID1. These siRNAs target endogenous MID1 without affecting the renilla-MID1-3′-UTR construct. Upon depletion of endogenous MID1, a significant reduction of the expression of the MID1-3′-UTR-luciferase construct was observed (Fig. <1i>), while the control construct without the MID1-3′-UTR was not affected by MID1 knockdown. These data suggest that MID1 indeed stabilizes its own mRNA by interacting with its 3′-UTR.In summary, these data suggest a mechanism in which resveratrol stimulates PP2A activity by targeting the MID1 protein towards degradation via the proteasome. MID1 stabilizes its own mRNA. Dissociation of the MID1-PP2Ac complex leads to the proteasomal degradation of the MID1 protein followed by destabilization of its mRNA. Thereby, reduced expression of the ubiquitin ligase MID1 results in the stabilization of microtubule-associated PP2Ac (Fig. <2a>). Tau is phosphorylated at multiple serine/threonine sites, many of which are PP2A-sensitive. To test if resveratrol also reduces the expression of MID1 in neuronal cells, murine primary cortical neurons were treated with resveratrol for 20 hours and MID1 protein expression was studied on western blots. A clear reduction of MID1 protein expression was observed after resveratrol treatment (Fig. <2b>). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses from similarly treated cells revealed that MID1 mRNA levels were also significantly reduced after resveratrol treatment for 20 hours (Fig. <2c>). The observed reduction of MID1 expression will activate PP2A towards its target proteins including Tau. To confirm that deregulation of the MID1 complex leads to dephosphorylation of Tau, primary cortical neurons were treated with a peptide that mimics the MID1-α4 binding site and thus will outcompete the binding of MID1 to PP2A. As expected, inhibition of MID1-PP2A complex assembly leads to significant decrease of Tau phophorylation (Fig. <2d>).Next, we tested if the resveratrol-dependent reduction of MID1 also affects Tau phosphorylation. Primary cortical neurons from wild-type mice were treated with increasing concentrations of resveratrol for 20 hours. Cells were lysed and the phosphorylation pattern of Tau at selected PP2A-sensitive sites<2>,<33>–<35> was analysed on western blots. Phosphorylation of the PP2A-sensitive Tau epitope p-S202 was significantly reduced in resveratrol treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <3a>). rhetorical Figure 3 Resveratrol increases PP2A activity and dephosphorylates Tau at PP2A-sensitive sites in primary cortical neurons.

Primary cortical neurons from wild-type mice were treated with increasing concentrations of resveratrol for 20 hours. Cells were lysed and the phosphorylation pattern of Tau at selected PP2A-sensitive sites<2>,<33>–<35> was analysed on western blots. Phosphorylation of the PP2A-sensitive Tau epitope p-S202 was significantly reduced in resveratrol treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <3a>). In a second series of experiments primary neurons from wild-type mice were incubated with 100 µM resveratrol over increasing periods of time. Cells were lysed and analysed for phosphorylation at the PP2A-sensitive epitope p-S202. A significant decrease of S202 phosphorylation was detected after 10 hours but not after 2 hours of incubation (Fig. <3c>). Phosphorylation at S396, which is not an efficient PP2A target site<34>, however, remained unaffected by resveratrol treatment (Fig. <3c,d>), clearly suggesting a PP2A-dependent mechanism of resveratrol activity. The influence of resveratrol on PP2A activity was analysed by monitoring the phosphorylation pattern of two direct targets of PP2A, p70-S6 kinase 1 (S6K) and the ribosomal protein S6. Phosphorylation of S6K and S6 was decreased in primary neurons in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after incubation with resveratrol (Fig. <3e,f>).To prove that the resveratrol-induced dephosphorylation of Tau is indeed PP2A-dependent, primary neurons were either treated with a PP2A inhibitor (okadaic acid) or with resveratrol or with both substances simultaneously. As expected, the resveratrol effect was blocked in the double treated cells, indicating that resveratrol influences Tau phosphorylation in a PP2A-dependent manner. Similarly, a partial block of the resveratrol effect by okadaic acid was seen on another PP2A target protein S6 (Fig. <3g>).A cell toxicity assay was used to prove that the observed effects were not caused by an increase in cell death after resveratrol treatment for 20 hours. Up to a concentration of 100 µM resveratrol had no detectable influence on cell viability (Fig. <3h>). These observations were also confirmed in OLNt40 cells that stably express the longest isoform of human Tau (Supplementary Fig. <1>). To test if resveratrol is capable of reducing Tau phosphorylation in vivo, wild type mice were treated with resveratrol for 2 weeks by daily intraperitoneal injections (25 mg/kg). Brain lysates of these mice were analysed for Tau phosphorylation on western blots. As expected, multiple bands, corresponding to the different Tau isoforms expressed in adult brain were detected. Blots were analysed with an antibody detecting phosphorylated tau (p-S202) and an antibody detecting dephosphorylation at the S202 site (Tau-1). Quantification revealed that, similar to the cell culture models, a significant reduction of Tau phosphorylation at epitope S202 was observed in resveratrol treated mice (Fig. <4a>).

Our data suggest that MID1 plays a significant role in regulating PP2A activity and the phosphorylation of Tau in neurons. It therefore may be a key factor in the pathology of AD and other tauopathies. In brains of AD patients, both reduced PP2A activity and reduced PP2A expression had been shown previously<4>–<8>. To test the hypothesis that this reduction of PP2A activity may be at least in parts caused by MID1 hyperactivity, we performed immunohistochemistry staining of MID1 in post-mortem brain tissue of two patients with hyperphosphorylated Tau and Aβ plaques. Interestingly, while very little MID1 staining was observed in a healthy control sample, in both patients a clearly enriched MID1 staining was visible (Fig. <5>). This increase in MID1 expression in AD strengthens the hypothesis that the MID1 protein complex is a promising drug target for AD therapy. rhetorical Figure 5 MID1 immunostaining of the temporal cortex from human control and patients with hyperphosphorylated Tau and Aβ plaque deposition.

This increase in MID1 expression in AD strengthens the hypothesis that the MID1 protein complex is a promising drug target for AD therapy. One of the two major pathological hallmarks of AD is the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs), protein aggregates formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that dissociates from the microtubules. PP2A is the most important phosphatase that dephosphorylates Tau and thereby can prevent its microtubule-dissociation and the formation of PHFs. Activation of PP2A is a promising tool in the prevention and therapy of AD and related tauopathies. We here show that resveratrol destabilizes the microtubule-associated ubiquitin ligase MID1 in vitro and in vivo. Degradation of the MID1 protein destabilizes the MID1 mRNA resulting in even lower MID1 protein levels. MID1 plays a key role in the proteasomal degradation of PP2A<9>, its loss of function results in an accumulation of microtubule-associated PP2A and an increase of PP2A activity at the microtubules. Our data demonstrate that through proteasomal degradation of MID1 protein and the subsequent destabilization of its mRNA, resveratrol reduces MID1 expression, which is followed by a significant increase of microtubule-associated PP2A activity (shown by a decrease of phosphorylation of the PP2A targets S6K and S6). PP2A leads to the dephosphorylation of the microtubule-associated Tau protein at PP2A specific sites (Fig. <6>). Therefore, our data support a beneficial role of resveratrol in AD pathology. rhetorical Figure 6 Resveratrol has multiple biological functions that are relevant for AD. Resveratrol acts on the neuropathological hallmarks of AD via multiple routes. Resveratrol inhibits the expression of MID1, thereby activating PP2A and dephosphorylating Tau. Additionally, MID1 induces the PP2A opposing kinase mTOR. Resveratrol induces degradation pathways by inhibiting mTOR signalling and inducing AMPK, thereby stimulating the clearance of Aβ. Resveratrol inhibits BACE1, resulting in decreased Aβ production. Resveratrol induces ADAM10, resulting in a preferential cleavage of APP via the non-amyloidogenic pathway. One of the two major pathological hallmarks of AD is the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs), protein aggregates formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that dissociates from the microtubules. PP2A is the most important phosphatase that dephosphorylates Tau and thereby can prevent its microtubule-dissociation and the formation of PHFs.

Our data demonstrate that through proteasomal degradation of MID1 protein and the subsequent destabilization of its mRNA, resveratrol reduces MID1 expression, which is followed by a significant increase of microtubule-associated PP2A activity (shown by a decrease of phosphorylation of the PP2A targets S6K and S6). PP2A leads to the dephosphorylation of the microtubule-associated Tau protein at PP2A specific sites (Fig. <6>). Therefore, our data support a beneficial role of resveratrol in AD pathology. Resveratrol has diverse biological activities and it has been shown to play a significant neuroprotective role in several diseases like Parkinson’s disease<13>,<14>, Huntington’s disease<18>, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<36> and ischemic brain injury<37>. Also, with respect to AD, resveratrol has multiple beneficial effects. The underlying neuroprotective pathways are diverse. Most of them seem to interfere with senile plaques, which are composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Aβ is derived from sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β-secretase BACE1 and the α-secretase<38>. Resveratrol has been suggested to induce the α-secretase ADAM10, which outcompetes BACE1 and thereby reduces Aβ-production<15>. In addition resveratrol has been found to directly reduce BACE1 activity<39>,<40>. Resveratrol also induces protein degradation pathways for example it stimulates AMPK signalling and induces mTOR-dependent autophagy<41>–<45>. Furthermore, resveratrol can also directly act on Aβ aggregates, where it modulates Aβ confomers such that non-toxic high-molecular weight species are built<46>. Interestingly, the resveratrol-mediated reduction of Aβ increases life span and improves learning and memory<15>,<40>, reduces neuroinflammation<47> and reduces oxidative stress<48>.Possible influences of resveratrol on hyperphosphorylated Tau are far less studied. We show here that resveratrol efficiently induces dephosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in vitro and in vivo. Our data are supported by observations that treatment with a polyphenolic derivative of resveratrol (pterostilbene) reduces Tau phosphorylation in mice and improves behaviour<49>. In the same study, however, the authors did not see an effect on Tau when using resveratrol. This is in contrast to our data and to the observations of Porquet et al., who also saw a decrease of phospho-Tau after resveratrol treatment in mice<15>. This can probably be explained by the usage of different mouse models and/or different treatment protocols (see also paragraph on bioavailability of resveratrol below).An important question for the treatment of diseases of the nervous system is if or if not the polyphenol resveratrol passes the blood-brain barrier. This has been studied and demonstrated in laboratory animals<44>,<50> and humans<51>. Of note, resveratrol not only passes but also protects the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in AD<47>. In a Class II clinical trial, resveratrol has been shown to be safe and well tolerated<51>. An adverse caveat of resveratrol in a therapeutic approach is its low bioavailability. Resveratrol is poorly soluble in water and is rapidly metabolized<52>. To avoid these problems Frozza et al. have used resveratrol incapsulated in loaded-lipid core nanoparticles. They could show that treatment with these nanoparticles significantly reduced neurotoxicity in rats that received intracerebroventricular injections of Aβ<53>. All these data together suggest that resveratrol is a promising lead compound for the prophylaxis and treatment of AD. Modified versions of resveratrol with higher bioavailability and increased target-efficacy will have to be developed in future studies.In addition to the known modes of action of resveratrol, we show here that resveratrol destabilizes the MID1 ubiquitin ligase thereby significantly decreasing its protein levels in tissue culture and in vivo. MID1 is a negative regulator of PP2A that mediates the ubiquitin specific degradation of PP2A. Its loss of function leads to an increase of PP2A protein and activity levels<9>. At the same time MID1 stimulates the activity of the PP2A-opposing kinase mTOR<54>. Several bits of evidence have suggested an influence of resveratrol on PP2A and its opposing kinase mTOR before: in a large in vitro kinase screen S6K, a primary target of both PP2A and mTOR, was identified as a direct target of resveratrol<55>. In support of that we demonstrate here that resveratrol causes a significant reduction in phosphorylation of the two primary PP2A/mTOR targets S6K and S6 in primary neurons and Tau-expressing OLNt40 cells in a time and dose dependent manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5653760_5,"In the same cells the effects of resveratrol on S6K and S6 could be reversed by the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid  This points towards a mechanism that directly involves (increased) PP2A activity.Finally, both, reduced PP2A protein and activity levels have been described in brains of AD patients. We here demonstrate significantly elevated expression of MID1 in brains of AD patients compared to age-matched controls. According to previous and our present data that suggest a key role of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase in the processing of PP2A, one could speculate that high MID1 levels contribute to low PP2A levels and hyperphosphorylated Tau in AD.Taken together our data suggest an important role for the microtubule-associated MID1 ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of neuronal PP2A activity and the dephosphorylation of Tau. Furthermore, we demonstrate a new mode of action of resveratrol that supports potentially beneficial effects of resveratrol in AD.

The peptide (GSK′364A) containing a 29-residue sequence from α4 (AQAKVFGAGYPSLPTMTVSDWYEQHRKYG) with an N-terminal sequence derived from HIV-TAT protein (RKKRRQRRR) was supplied by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Billingham, UK). It was synthesised using standard automated solid-phase peptide synthesis via the Fmoc/tBu strategy. Cleavage from the resin was performed using 95% trifluoroacetic acid. Crudes were purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), freeze dried and characterised by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.Female wild type C57BL/6 mice at an age of 12 weeks were treated for 2 weeks with 25 mg/kg resveratrol by daily intraperitoneal injections.

Proteins were resolved on 8 or 10% SDS gels and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Roche). The resulting bands were quantified using the Imagequant 5.2 software. Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software. Columns shown in graphs represent mean values +/− SEM. Data were analysed by multiple t-tests or one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s test to accommodate for multiple comparisons. Antibodies used in this study were purchased from the following companies: Tau-5 (Biosource), anti-human PHF p-S202 (Thermo scientific), Tau p-Ser356 (Biosource), Tau p-S262 (Biosource), Tau p-S396 (Sigma), actin (Sigma), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein p-Ser241/244 (Cell signalling), S6 ribosomal protein (Cell signalling), S6K (Cell signalling), p-S6K p-T421/p-S424 (Cell signalling), mTOR (Cell signalling), HRP-anti-rabbit (Amersham), HRP-anti-mouse (Dianova), FLAG-HRP (SIGMA), V5 (Invitrogen). Generation of anti-α4 was described previously<9>. For production of polyclonal MID1 antibodies MID1-peptides were synthesized (amino acids 84–113) and used for immunisation of rabbits (PINEDA). Eight weeks after immunisation high-titre sera were collected and affinity purified using the peptide coupled to SulfoLink Coupling Resin (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified antibodies were then validated on western blots of cell lysates from cells that underwent MID1 siRNA mediated knockdown, as well as in western blot experiments in which peptide-blocking was performed (data not shown). Cells were grown in a 96-well plate and treated with increasing concentrations of resveratrol for 20 hours. Cell viability was then measured using the WST-1 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells were incubated with the ready-to-use WST-1 reagent, which can be cleaved to a soluble formazan by cellular processes dependent on NAD(P)H. The formazan dye was quantified in an ELISA reader and this signal directly correlates to the number of metabolic active cells in the culture. OLN-t40 cells are a permanent oligodendroglia cell line derived from primary rat brain glial cultures, stably expressing the longest human Tau isoform, which has been established by Goldbaum et al.<56>. Cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml G418. OLN-t40 were transfected with FLAG-MID1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK293T cells were plated in 75 cm2 flasks at a density of 8 × 105 one day prior transfection.

Immunoprecipitation was carried out using V5-specific antibodies or unspecific mouse IgG as negative controls in combination with Protein A-Agarose (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibody-bound proteins were incubated with or without resveratrol (100 µM) for 2 hours and subsequently immunoprecipitates were washed with IP-buffer with or without resveratrol for 2 hours and immunoprecipitates were analysed on western blots. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was done with the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems) and real-time PCR was carried out using the SYBRGreen PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences see Table <S1>. 7.5 × 104 HEK293T cells (24-well plate) were transfected with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) and siRNA oligonucleotides (Table <S1>) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 hours after knockdown cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and psiCHECK-2 luciferase reporter plasmids. 24 hours after psiCHECK transfection, cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer. Firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Assay system (Promega) and a FLUOstar Omega luminescence microplate reader (BMG Labtech).

In all cases, the donors or next-of-kin have provided informed consent to procure biospecimens for biomedical research. Research on human samples was performed following The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Samples were manipulated following the universal standards for working with human samples and as directed by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas Medical School at Houston (IRB approval # HSC-MS-14-0608).Patient 1 showed clinical signs of AD and dementia was diagnosed 4 years before death at the age of 65 years. In this patient severe Aβ plaque the presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau was observed. Patient 2 showed extensive Aβ plaque accumulation and the presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau and neurofibrillary tangles but had no clinical signs of AD at the age of 61 years. The control sample had no AD pathology or related clinical signs (79 years).Formalin-fixed samples from the temporal cortex were immunostained. Sections were deparaffinised and digested with pepsin, 1 mg/ml in 0.1 N HCl for 30 minutes at room temperature for antigen retrieval. To reduce non-specific staining sections were incubated with 10% Normal Donkey Serum for 1 hour. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-MID1 antibody (Abcam ab70770), followed by incubation with donkey-anti-rabbit biotin conjugated secondary antibody. Peroxidase reaction was visualized using DAB Kit (Vector) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nuclei were stained by eosin staining. Finally, sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol and mounted with Cytoseal 60.For immunofluorescence stainings, sections were deparaffinised and digested with pepsin, 1 mg/ml in 0.1 N HCl for 15 minutes at room temperature for antigen retrieval. Sections were blocked with 10% Normal Donkey Serum for 1 hour and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-MID1 antibody (Abcam ab70770), followed by incubation with alexa fluor A2120-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. After washing, sections were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher).We used a generalized linear model to analyze differences in red channel intensities between patient and control groups. This statistical model accounts for confounding subject-dependent effects. Due to non-negative nature of intensities, the data is modeled using the gamma distribution. The interaction between MID1 and α4 was studied in an AlphaScreen (Perkin Elmer) protein protein interaction assay using a GST-tagged MID1-construct consisting of the two BBox domains (which contains the binding site for α4) and biotinylated α4. The AlphaScreen kit (Perkin Elmer) that was used to measure the binding between MID1 and α4 contained streptavidin donor and Ni-chelate acceptor beads. In this assay, α4 was coupled to the donor beads, and MID1 was bound to the acceptor beads. Upon binding between MID1 and α4 the donor and acceptor beads come into proximity, and the excitation of the donor will result in generation of a fluorescent signal. The purified proteins (at a final concentration of 50 nM) were incubated with or without different doses of resveratrol for 2 hours and then the AlphaScreen beads (at a final concentration of 20 µg/ml) were added. The reaction was incubated over night at room temperature in a buffer containing 50 mM Phosphate pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% DMSO, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA. The formation of paired helical filaments (PHF), which are composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein dissociating from microtubules, is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The most important phosphatase that is capable of dephosphorylating Tau at AD specific phospho-sites is protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A). Here we show that resveratrol, a polyphenol, significantly induces PP2A activity and reduces Tau phosphorylation at PP2A-dependent epitopes. The increase in PP2A activity is caused by decreased expression of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitin-specific modification and degradation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A when bound to microtubules. Interestingly, we further show that MID1 expression is elevated in AD tissue. Our data suggest a key role of MID1 in the pathology of AD and related tauopathies. Together with previous studies showing that resveratrol reduces β-amyloid toxicity they also give evidence of a promising role for resveratrol in the prophylaxis and therapy of AD. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4816799_0,"Synaptic spine loss is one of the major preceding consequences of stroke damages, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that a direct interaction of DAPK1 with Tau causes spine loss and subsequently neuronal death in a mouse model with stroke. We found that DAPK1 phosphorylates Tau protein at Ser262 (pS262) in cortical neurons of stroke mice. Either genetic deletion of DAPK1 kinase domain (KD) in mice (DAPK1-KD−/−) or blocking DAPK1-Tau interaction by systematic application of a membrane permeable peptide protects spine damages and improves neurological functions against stroke insults. Thus, disruption of DAPK1-Tau interaction is a promising strategy in clinical management of stroke. We greatly appreciate Prof. Hengye Man from Boston University for revising our manuscript; Dr Yihao Yao and Dr Shun Zhang from Radiation Center of Tongji Hospital for the MRI assistance; and Prof. Ruey-Hwa Chen from Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica (Taiwan) for presenting the truncated DAPK1 constructs.  Conflict of interest:  None declared. Stroke is caused by acute brain artery bursting or cerebral embolism, leading to neuronal death and sever dysfunction of synaptic transmission (<Tu et al. 2010>). Loss of synaptic spine has been considered the earliest event of cerebral ischemia and generally assumed to be associated with the subsequent brain damages (<Hofmeijer and van Putten 2012>). Thus, protection against synaptic loss is widely considered a promising strategy in stroke therapy.Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a Ca2+/CaM-dependent serine/threonine kinase, is originally identified by a functional cloning based on its involvement in interferon-γ-induced apoptosis (<Bialik and Kimchi 2006>). Our previous work demonstrated that following stroke, DAPK1 in the postsynaptic domain phosphorylated NMDA receptor NR2B at Serine-1303, eventually leading to neuronal death (<Tu et al. 2010>). Recently, we found that DAPK1 could also phosphorylate p53 at Serine-23 via direct binding of the DAPK1 death domain (DD) to the DNA-binding motif of p53 (p53DM) (<Pei et al. 2014>; <Wang et al. 2014>). Though a handful of DAPK1 substrates have been identified, downstream signaling of DAPK1 that specifically mediates early spine damage after ischemic injuries is yet to be characterized.Tau protein colocalizes and co-immunoprecipitates with PSD95, a postsynaptic protein, and regulates the association of PSD-95 with NMDAR subunits, indicating the existence of endogenous Tau in dendritic spines probably participating in synaptic functions (<Ittner et al. 2010>). In addition, Tau abundantly contains high content of serine/threonine residuals and plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases. There are 79 potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites on the longest human Tau isoform. And phosphorylation of >30 of the phosphorylation sites has been reported (<Morris et al. 2011>). It is known that phosphorylation of these sites plays important roles in ischemic stroke-induced neuronal death (<Lee et al. 2001>; <Zheng et al. 2010>). However, the relative importance of individual phosphorylation site is still controversial.In the present study, we demonstrated that DAPK1 directly phosphorylated Tau on Ser262, causing spine damage in the cortical neurons following stroke. We identified a binding domain of DAPK1 in the Tau microtubule repeat domains (R) with a sequence as XXIGSTENLKXX. We synthesized a membrane-permeable blocking peptide (TAT-R1D) to disrupt DAPK1-Tau binding and Tau phosphorylation. We found that systematic administration of TAT-R1D, even 6 h after stroke, at a single dose of 2 mg/kg produced therapeutic effects against stroke damages. Adult (90 ± 5 days old) male C57BL/6J mice were used and housed individually under standard conditions of temperature and humidity and a 12 h of light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00) with free access to food and water. Adequate measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort during surgeries. All the experiments were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee (Huazhong University of Science and Technology). To identify the specific impacts of DAPK1-kinase domain (DAPK1-KD) deletion in brain function, we generated a conditional mutant strain of mice with a selective deletion of DAPK1-KD in the brain (DAPK1-KD−/− mice) by crossing DAPK1-KDloxp/loxp transgenic mice (Tg1) and CaMK2α-creERT2 mice (Tg2). For details, see the Supplementary Material. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Briefly, a 7/0 surgical nylon monofilament with rounded tip was introduced into the left internal carotid through the external carotid stump and advanced 10–13 mm past the carotid bifurcation. Occlusion was confirmed when blood flow was reduced by at least 80% of the baseline. The filament was left in place for 60 min and then withdrawn. The sham-operated animals were treated identically, except that the middle cerebral artery was not occluded after the neck incision. Each mouse was anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and maintained with 1% isoflurane in an oxygen/air mixture by using a gas anesthesia mask in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting). The rectal temperature was maintained during surgery at 37 ± 0.5°C with a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus). At indicated time point after ischemic reperfusion, brain was removed rapidly and frozen at −20°C for 5 min. Coronal slices (7 slices from each mouse) were made at 1 mm from the frontal tips, and sections were immersed in 2% TTC at 37°C for 20 min. The presence or absence of infarctions was determined by examining TTC-stained sections for the areas that did not stain with TTC. Stereotactic injection of 2 µL of viral suspension containing 10E8 t.u. was at coordinates 1.94 mm posterior, 1.4 mm lateral and 2.2 mm ventral relative to bregma (<Paxinos and Franklin, 2012>). At indicated times after injection, the mice were anesthetized using pentobarbital (Nembutal) and perfused transcardially using 50 mL of ice-cold saline for 5 min. Brain were removed rapidly and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent spine analysis on 40 µm free-floating coronal vibratome (VT1000S; Leica) sections. Immunofluorescent microscopy (LSM710, Zeiss) images were taken of cortical pyramidal neurons (73 cells with a total of 60 cm length of dendrites per group were analyzed) under 100 × oil lens. Images were coded and synaptic spines counted in software with Image Probes. All the spines were measured for spine densities analysis and expressed as spine/µm dendrite. At indicated time points after ischemia, animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); the sections were dried overnight. A TUNEL staining kit (DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system, Promega) was used to visualize cell death in 10-μm coronal frozen sections, as per kit instructions. Labeled sections were visualized with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM710, Zeiss). All labeled cells within the reticule field (0.05 mm2 at the magnification used) were counted using Image J throughout the depth of the section for 4 adjacent fields (beginning at a random starting position) of each section. Animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.01 m PBS, pH 7.4). Brain tissues were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then treated with 30% sucrose (in 0.1 m PB, pH 7.4) overnight till the tissue sink to the bottom. Cryosections (30 μm) were cut and stored at −20°C. Mounted brain sections were allowed to thaw at room temperature. Donkey or goat serum was used for blocking for 1 h. Next, the antibody to DAPK1 (rabbit, Cell Signaling Technology, #3008, 1:1000) and Tau (mouse,1:1000, MAB361, Millipore) or pS262 (mouse, 1:1000, SAB11111, Signalway Antibody) were incubated for 48 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and TRITC-conjugated second antibodies were then added and incubated for 1 h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4816799_1,"The above-mentioned procedures were also used into primary cultured neurons (DIV 10) to identify the co-localizations of DAPK1 with Tau or with pS262  To visualize uptake of the peptide (Tat-R1D (IGSTENLK)-FITC) in the brain, standard immunostaining procedures were performed on free-floating frozen sections (30 μm) with overnight incubation at 4°C with chicken anti-GFAP antibody (1:1000, Abcam,ab7260) or mouse anti-NeuN (1:1000, MAB377, Millipore) or mouse anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:1000, Abcam, ab5076), and then 2 h of incubation with anti-chicken Alexa594 or anti-mouse Alexa 594 antibodies, as well as 5 min of exposure to 4′,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI, 1:10 000) as a counterstain. Slices were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, cover-slipped. The sections were examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss) using an omnichrome air-cooled helium/neon laser tuned to produce beams at 488 and 594 nm. Five randomly selected sections from the whole brain sections were used. All immunoreactive positive profiles in a section were outlined, creating an artificial overlay. Measuring the average optical density of double-labeled cells was conducted on confocal images randomly taken from 2 view fields from each section, and the measuring was performed using NIH Image J software. Ischemic core of the cortex samples were dissected in cold artificial cerebral spinal fluids (aCSF) and homogenized in 200 µl 0.32 m sucrose buffer (mM) (10 sucrose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) containing a “complete” protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche diagnostics). Samples were centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min, 4°C) to yield the nuclear enriched pellet and the S1 fraction. The S1 fraction was centrifuged (12 000 × g, 20 min, 4°C) to obtain supernatant (S2; microsomes and cytosol) and pellet (P2; crude synaptosomal membranes) fractions. The S2 fraction was centrifuged (160 000 × g, 2 h, 4°C) to separate the cytosolic (supernatant) and microsomal (pellet) fractions. The P2 synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in 100 µl 4 mm HEPES buffer (mm) (4 HEPES, 1 EDTA, pH 7.4) and again centrifuged (12 000 × g, 20 min, 4°C). Resuspension and centrifugation was repeated. The resulting pellet was resuspended with buffer A (mM) (20 HEPES, 100 NaCl, 0.5% Triton, pH 7.2) and rotated slowly (15 min, 4°C), followed by centrifugation (12 000 × g, 20 min, 4°C). The supernatant (triton-soluble NP fraction) containing non-PSD membranes was retained. The pellet was resuspended in 120 µl buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, pH7.5), followed by gentle rotating (1 h, 4°C) and centrifugation (10 000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). The pellet was discarded and the supernatant (triton insoluble PSD fraction) retained. Microsomal, cytosolic, PSD and non-PSD samples were stored at −80°C until use. Protein concentration in the extracts was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The extracts (500 μg protein) were incubated with nonspecific IgG (2 μg) or polyclonal rabbit anti-DAPK1 (2 μg; Cell Signaling Technology, #3008) or anti-Tau (2 μg, Millipore, MAB361) overnight at 4°C, followed by the addition of 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (Millipore, 16–266) for 3 h at 4°C. For the Co-IP experiments in HEK293 cells, the cells were lysed in IP buffer (mm) (20 Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 NaCl, 1 EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 04693116001). After 20 min of incubation at 4°C with gentle vortex mixing, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 13 000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Sample aliquots (500 μl) were precleared with 10 μl Protein A/G-agarose beads (11719394001, 11719386001, Roche) and incubated with 1 μg of antibody or control IgG overnight at 4°C, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The precipitates were washed 4 times with lysis buffer and denatured with SDS sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS–PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad mini-protein-III wet transfer unit overnight at 4°C. Transfer membranes were then incubated with blocking solution (5% nonfat dried milk dissolved in TBST buffer containing (mm): 10 Tris–HCl, 150 NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times, and incubated with primary antibody against anti-DAPK1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #3008, 1:1000) or anti-Tau (Millipore, MAB361, 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times with TBST buffer and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h followed by washing 4 times. Signal detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The lanes marked “input” were loaded with 10% of the starting material used for immunoprecipitation.To determine the binding domain of DAPK1 with Tau protein, the DAPK1 deletion mutants (Flag-DAPK1ΔDD, Flag-DAPK1ΔKD, Flag-DAPK1K42A and Flag-DAPK1ΔCaM) were generated from full-length cDNA mouse DAPK11−1431. Purified Flag fusion proteins were separated using SDS–PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was washed with distilled water and blocked with TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with affinity binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 12 mm-mercaptoethanol, 1.0% polyethylene glycol, 10 µg/ml protease inhibitors, and 500 µg/ml purified GFP-tagged Tau40 for 1 h at room temperature and washed 4 times for 5 min with affinity binding buffer. Bound DAPK1 and Tau40 was detected with anti-Flag (1:2000, Invitrogen) and anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen), respectively. The truncated DAPK1 constructs, including DAPK1ΔKD (residues 288–1430), DAPK1ΔCaM, DAPK1ΔDD (residues 1–1398), and DAPK1K42A mutants, were received as a gift from Prof. R-H Chen (Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica). The vectors were re-cloned into the rAVE construct through ApaI/KpnI (GenDetect).cDNA encoding Tau40 in pRK5 was used as the template for PCR amplification. The PCR products were digested using SalI and Cla1. The resulting fragment was ligated to an SalI-digested rAVE-eGFP vector (GenDetect, Ltd.) to generate rAVE-Tau40-eGFP under the control of a CAG enhancer and was terminated using the polyadenylation signal in the 3′ long terminal repeat. Phospho-deficient (substitution of serine at position 262 to alanine, S262A) construct was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the supplier's manual and verified by sequencing analysis. Tau-S262A and Tau-WT (wild type) were subcloned into the rAVE-eGFP vector (GenDetect, Ltd.). rAVE-Tau40-eGFP or rAVE-Tau-S262A-eGFP was co-transfected with the AAV helper 1/2 into HEK293 cells to generate high titers (9 × 1012 genomic particles/ml) of rAAV1/2 infectious particles. Phosphorylation can occur at a serine (S), threonine (T) or tyrosine (Y) residue. We identified phosphorylated residues in the Tau sequences using phosphorylated residue prediction tool, GPS2.1 (<Xue et al. 2008>). The prediction threshold value for GPS2.1 was set to be “high.” To further confirm the predicted phosphorylation sites, purified DAPK1-precipitated Tau protein samples were separated by SDS–PAGE gel. Corresponding areas of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) (40–70 kDa) were cut out from the coomassie blue stained SDS–PAGEs. Gel pieces underwent in-gel digestion and were subjected to a nanoLC-ESI-Iontrap mass spectrometer (BrukerDaltonik GmbH). Each spectrum was internally calibrated with mass signals of trypsin autolysisions to reach a typical mass measurement accuracy of ±10 ppm. Raw data were searched in the SWISS-PROT database. Cerebral cortex was isolated from the E20 wild-type mice or DAPK1-KD−/− mice, as we described before (<Tu et al. 2010>; <Yang et al. 2012>). Cells were dissociated and purified using papain dissociation kit (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) platted with the densities of 100–150 cells/mm2 on 19-mm coverslips coated with 30 μg/ml poly-d-lysine and 2 μg/ml laminin. Cells were placed in fresh serum-free Neurobasal Medium (21 103, GIBCO) plus 2% B27 and fed every 4 days with fresh media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4816799_2,"The cultures were immunostained for β-tubulin III (Tuj1), a neuronal marker to confirm that these cultures were >85% neurons  On Day 9 (DIV 9), DAPK1 or DAPK1-KD−/− was co-expressed with a wild-type Tau (Tau-WT) or Tau-S262A mutant (S262A) in HEK293 cells using the respective rAAV1/2-virus particles, as indicated. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in voltage clamp mode using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.), digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Data were acquired and analyzed using Clampfit 10.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Whole-cell recording pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing (in mm): 120 CH4SO3, 20 CaCl2, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.05 EGTA, 4 Mg2ATP, 0.2 Na3GTP, 5 QX314 and ∼290 mOsm. The bath solution contained (in mm): 124.0 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 26.0 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgCl2•6H2O, 1.25 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 10.0 C6H12O6, 2.0 CaCl2 (pH 7.4), ∼305 mOsm. Miniature AMPAR-dependent EPSCs were isolated by including D-APV (50 µm), bicuculine (10 µm), and 1 µm tetrodotoxin in the bath solution. All recordings were performed at a holding potential of −70 mV at room temperature. mEPSCs were identified using a template with a threshold of −6 pA (2.5 × SD of the noise) and were individually proofread for accuracy. To plot summary graphs, the average frequency from the eGFP control cells from each culture preparation was normalized. Individual cells from all 4 conditions were then compared with this normalized average. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 1.5–2% and kept at 37°C, and an MR compatible respiration sensor was used to control the animals. All the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments were performed on a BIOSPEC BMT 47/40 (Bruker) spectrometer operating a 4.7T, equipped with an 11.2-cm actively shielded gradient system, capable of 200 mT/m gradient strength and 80 μs of rise time. A 7-cm bird cage radiofrequency coil was used for transmission and reception. T2-Weighted Imaging (T2WI) were acquired using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) technique, with a repetition time (TR) = 1650 s, RARE factor = 16, and inter echo interval = 10 ms, resulting in an effective echo time (TE) = 80 ms, the field of view (FOV) = 4 × 4 × 4 cm3. The acquired matrix size was 128 × 128 × 64. These data were zero-filled to obtain a reconstructed matrix size of 128 × 128 × 128. The brain tissue slides were immersed for 3 min in 100% ethanol, for 1 min in 70% ethanol, and for 1 min in distilled water and then incubated in a solution containing 0.01% Fluoro-Jade C (Millipore) and 0.1% acetic acid (1:10) for 30 min on a shaker. After three 10-min washes, the slides were cover-slipped and imaged with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss). The number of FJ positive (FJ+) cells in each group was counted. Brains were removed from mice and immediately immersed in Solution A and B for 2 weeks at room temperature and transferred into Solution C for 24 h at 4°C, as instructed on the manufacture's experimental methods (FD rapid Golgi Stain kit, FD NeuroTechnologies). The brains were sliced using a Vibratome (VT1000S; Leica) at a thickness of 100 µm. Bright-field microscopy (Axio Observer; Zeiss) images were taken of cortex pyramidal neurons (50 cells with a total of 60 cm length of dendrites per group were analyzed). Images were coded and synaptic spines counted in software with Image Pro plus 6.0. All the spines were counted, and spine densities were expressed as spine/µm dendrite. The mice underwent a 60 min MCAO were injected (i.v.) with vehicle (saline) or TAT-R1D or TAT-s-R1D at a single dose of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg body weight. In another group, 3, 6, or 9 h after MCAO, mice were injected with vehicle or TAT-R1D or TAT-s-R1D (2 mg/kg body weight, i.v.). The peptides were numbered and the experimenters were unaware of which one was applied in all experiments. Neurological performance was scored daily using modified 7-point neurological scales (<Tu et al. 2010>); 0, no observable neurological deficits; 1, flexion of the contralateral torso; 2, circling to the ipsilateral side but normal posture at rest; 3, circling to the ipsilateral side; 4, rolling to the ipsilateral side; 5, leaning to the ipsilateral side at rest; 6, longitudinal spinning; and 7, no spontaneous motor activity/death. Score were ranked from 0 to 7 at an interval of 1.0. Neurological performance was always assessed by the blinded independent investigators. Motor coordination of the animals after operation and treatment was measured using a rotarod treadmill for mice (Ugo Basile), under the accelerating rotor mode (10 speeds from 4 to 40 rpm for 5 min). The interval from when the animal mounted the rod to when it fell off was recorded as the retention time, and the population of mice that walked for 300 s on the accelerating rotating rod was recorded as the walking survivor (<Chen et al. 2012>). The animals were trained for 2 days, 3 trials per day, before surgery, and the mean duration on the rod was recorded to obtain stable baseline values. Performance on the rotarod test was measured 3 times a day in the following 4 weeks after ischemic insult and peptide administration. All variance values in the text and figure legends are represented as mean ± SEM. Western blot results, spine analysis data, infarct volumes, TUNEL or FJ staining positive cells, Neurological scores, and electrophysiology data were analyzed using the ANOVA with the Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) tests. The data of behavioral studies were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (IBM) and Sigmaplot 12.0. Statistically significant differences were defined as P < 0.05. Dendritic spine density in the cortical neurons was analyzed in the frontal cortex of 2, 6, 12, and 24 h reperfusion after 1 h of MCAO by confocal imaging in brain tissue with AAV-eGFP infection 15 days before MCAO surgery (Fig. <1>A). In total, 1560 spines were counted on 30 dendrites per group. Hereby, we detected significant decreases in dendritic spine density from 2 h to 24 h after MCAO (Fig. <1>B,C). Consistently, the synaptic related proteins, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluA1), and Synapsin 1, were dramatically decreased 2 h after MCAO in the ischemic area (Fig. <1>D,E). Simultaneously, the TUNEL-labeled (TUNEL+) apoptotic cells in the same brain area were examined at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h of reperfusion after 1 h MCAO. We observed notable increases of TUNEL+ cells from 6 h to 24 h after MCAO (Fig. <1>F,G). In parallel, the protein levels of cleaved caspase 3 (Casp.3) were significantly increased 12 h after ischemic injury (Fig. <1>H,I). Taken the above results together, we found the spine damage was prior to apoptosis in cerebral ischemia. rhetorical Figure 1. Spine damage is prior to apoptosis in stroke.

PMC4816799_3,"Dendritic spine density in the cortical neurons was analyzed in the frontal cortex of 2, 6, 12, and 24 h reperfusion after 1 h of MCAO by confocal imaging in brain tissue with AAV-eGFP infection 15 days before MCAO surgery (Fig  <1>A). In total, 1560 spines were counted on 30 dendrites per group. Hereby, we detected significant decreases in dendritic spine density from 2 h to 24 h after MCAO (Fig. <1>B,C). Consistently, the synaptic related proteins, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluA1), and Synapsin 1, were dramatically decreased 2 h after MCAO in the ischemic area (Fig. <1>D,E). Simultaneously, the TUNEL-labeled (TUNEL+) apoptotic cells in the same brain area were examined at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h of reperfusion after 1 h MCAO. We observed notable increases of TUNEL+ cells from 6 h to 24 h after MCAO (Fig. <1>F,G). In parallel, the protein levels of cleaved caspase 3 (Casp.3) were significantly increased 12 h after ischemic injury (Fig. <1>H,I). Taken the above results together, we found the spine damage was prior to apoptosis in cerebral ischemia. To test whether DAPK1-Tau interaction mediates spine damage, we first examined whether DAPK1 interacts with Tau in ischemic brain tissue and primary cultured neurons under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). By double immunofluorescent staining and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that endogenous DAPK1 and Tau formed a complex in ischemic stroke (Fig. <2>A–D). Though the expression of DAPK1 and Tau was not changed after ischemia (Supplementary Fig. S1A,B), the activity of DAPK1, which is reflected by phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chain (pMLC, a substrate of DAPK1 to reflect DAPK1 catalytic activity), was substantially increased 2 and 24 h after stroke onset (Supplementary Fig. S1C). rhetorical Figure 2.

HEK293T cells expressing DAPK1 or its mutants were subjected to GST pull-down assays. (H) Co-IP of DAPK1 and Tau in Flag-tagged DAPK1 and GFP-tagged Tau co-transfected HEK293T cells. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or anti-GFP and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Flag or anti-GFP antibody. (I) HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged Tau, and Flag-tagged DAPK1-KD deletion mutant (Flag-ΔKD) were immunoprecipitated from lysates with anti-Flag and immunoblotted with anti-Flag and anti-GFP antibodies. To test whether DAPK1-Tau interaction mediates spine damage, we first examined whether DAPK1 interacts with Tau in ischemic brain tissue and primary cultured neurons under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). By double immunofluorescent staining and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that endogenous DAPK1 and Tau formed a complex in ischemic stroke (Fig. <2>A–D). Though the expression of DAPK1 and Tau was not changed after ischemia (Supplementary Fig. S1A,B), the activity of DAPK1, which is reflected by phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chain (pMLC, a substrate of DAPK1 to reflect DAPK1 catalytic activity), was substantially increased 2 and 24 h after stroke onset (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
To learn how DAPK1 associates with Tau, we co-transfected GFP-tagged Tau (GFP-Tau) with Flag-tagged DAPK1 (Flag-DAPK1) into HEK293T cell. GFP-Tau might combine with Flag-DAPK1 (Fig. <2>E) and form stable complexes. To identify the domain(s) in DAPK1 necessary for the interaction, we generated different DAPK1 mutants (Fig. <2>F and Supplementary
Fig. S2A,B). GST pull-down experiments revealed that GST-Tau, but not control GST, bound to Flag-DAPK1, its constitutively active form Flag-DAPK1ΔCaM, inactive form Flag-DAPK1K42A and DD deletion form Flag-DAPK1ΔDD, except DAPK1 KD deletion form Flag-DAPK1ΔKD (Fig. <2>G). In addition, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, all DAPK1 mutants could bind to Tau, except the DAPK1 KD deletion mutant (Flag-DAPK1ΔKD) (Fig. <2>H,I and Supplementary
Fig. S2C–E), suggesting that the KD is necessary for DAPK1 binding to Tau. Given DAPK1 associated with Tau, a central question is whether DAPK1 phosphorylates Tau in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether Tau is a substrate of DAPK1 we directly assessed Tau phosphorylation site by the prediction software GPS 2.1 and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. GPS 2.1 analysis suggested Ser262 of Human tau isoform (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_005901.2) as a potential phosphorylation site for DAPK1 (Fig. <3>A). Mass spectrum also demonstrated the Ser262 of Human tau isoform within the peptide IGSTENLK by DAPK1 after ischemic injury (Fig. <3>B,C; Supplementary Fig. S2A, Supplementary Table S1 and S2). Blast results from the NCBI protein database revealed that the peptide IGSTENLK is highly conserved among different mammalian species (Supplementary Fig. S2B). No other Tau phosphorylation site than Ser-262 was identified in the Mass Spectrum assay (Supplementary Table S3). rhetorical Figure 3. DAPK1 phosphorylates Tau on Ser262 in vitro and in vivo.

Given DAPK1 associated with Tau, a central question is whether DAPK1 phosphorylates Tau in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether Tau is a substrate of DAPK1 we directly assessed Tau phosphorylation site by the prediction software GPS 2.1 and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. GPS 2.1 analysis suggested Ser262 of Human tau isoform (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_005901.2) as a potential phosphorylation site for DAPK1 (Fig. <3>A). Mass spectrum also demonstrated the Ser262 of Human tau isoform within the peptide IGSTENLK by DAPK1 after ischemic injury (Fig.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4816799_4,"<3>B,C; Supplementary Fig  S2A, Supplementary Table S1 and S2). Blast results from the NCBI protein database revealed that the peptide IGSTENLK is highly conserved among different mammalian species (Supplementary Fig. S2B). No other Tau phosphorylation site than Ser-262 was identified in the Mass Spectrum assay (Supplementary Table S3). To further validate Human Tau Ser262 as the phosphorylation site for DAPK1 in vitro, we generated a mutant form of Tau in which the phosphorylation site Serine 262 was mutated to Alanine 262 (S262A) and co-expressed DAPK1 in the HEK293 cells with S262A. Immunocytochemistry results demonstrated DAPK1 did not co-localize with S262A (Fig. <3>D). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that DAPK1 did not interact with S262A (Fig. <3>E). Western blottings also showed that the expression of pS262 was dramatically increased in parallel with cleaved caspase 3 in HEK293 cells transfected with DAPK1 and Tau-WT, but not DAPK1 and S262A (Fig. <3>F).To further investigate phosphorylation of Tau on Ser-262 after ischemia in vivo, we next subjected C57BL/6 mice with MCAO for 60 min and examined Tau phosphorylation. Western blotting results showed that pS262, but not previously reported pS202 or pS422, was detected. It is known that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a key regulatory kinase of Tau. Unexpectedly, neither GSK3β nor its activated form, phosphorylated GSK3β (pGSK3β), is significantly altered within 24 h after MCAO operation (Fig. <3>G). These results indicate that DAPK1 phosphorylates Tau on Ser262 in cerebral ischemic stroke. Next, we co-transfected Tau-WT with DAPK1, S262A with DAPK1 into cultured primary cortical neurons or transfected Tau-WT into DAPK1-KD−/− cortical neurons from DAPK1-KD−/− mice to test whether Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 by DAPK1-KD mediates spine damage and neuronal apoptosis. Tau or S262A was fused with eGFP for visualization. DAPK1 and Tau-WT were co-transfected in cultured neurons at 9 days in vitro (DIV 9) (Fig. <4>A). We found that 12 days after transfection, there was a significant decrease in spine density (Fig. <4>B), an increase in synaptic pS262 (Fig. <4>C), and a reduction in synaptic proteins including PSD95, GluA1, and Synapsin 1 (Fig. <4>D). Consistently, we found a significant decline in both amplitude and frequency of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) (Fig. <4>E). On the contrary, co-transfection of DAPK1 with S262A or transfection of Tau-WT in DAPK1-KD−/− neurons decreased pS262 level and alleviated spine loss (Fig. <4>B–E). rhetorical Figure 4.

Next, we co-transfected Tau-WT with DAPK1, S262A with DAPK1 into cultured primary cortical neurons or transfected Tau-WT into DAPK1-KD−/− cortical neurons from DAPK1-KD−/− mice to test whether Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 by DAPK1-KD mediates spine damage and neuronal apoptosis. Tau or S262A was fused with eGFP for visualization. DAPK1 and Tau-WT were co-transfected in cultured neurons at 9 days in vitro (DIV 9) (Fig. <4>A). We found that 12 days after transfection, there was a significant decrease in spine density (Fig. <4>B), an increase in synaptic pS262 (Fig. <4>C), and a reduction in synaptic proteins including PSD95, GluA1, and Synapsin 1 (Fig. <4>D). Consistently, we found a significant decline in both amplitude and frequency of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) (Fig. <4>E). On the contrary, co-transfection of DAPK1 with S262A or transfection of Tau-WT in DAPK1-KD−/− neurons decreased pS262 level and alleviated spine loss (Fig. <4>B–E). To further define the effect of pS262 on neuronal apoptosis after ischemic insults in vitro, we treated the primary cultured neurons with OGD. We found that the TUNEL+/pS262+ cells were significantly decreased 60 min after OGD treatment in S262A-transfected neurons compared with Tau-WT transfected neurons (Fig. <4>F). Taken together, these results suggest that Tau is probably a major mediator of DAPK1 toxicity on dendritic spines and synaptic functions, which is largely dependent on phosphorylation of Ser262. To confirm the role of DAPK1-KD on spine damage and stroke injuries in vivo, we generated a conditional mutant strain of mice with a selective deletion of DAPK1-KD in the brain (DAPK1-KD−/− mice) by crossing CaMK2α-creERT2 and DAPK1-KD-Floxed transgenic mice (DAPK1-KDloxp/loxp mice) (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Deletion of KD induced 80% reduction in DAPK1-KD mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and >90% decrease of DAPK1 N terminal protein (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Furthermore, conditional knockout KD did not influence the animals' phenotype, such as body weight gain (Supplementary Fig. S4D,E), cerebral blood vessels and blood flow (Supplementary Fig. S4F), brain structure (Supplementary Fig. S4G), and anxiety-like behavior (Supplementary Fig. S4H). These results confirmed the successful deletion of KD in the brain, and this deletion exerted no significant phenotypic changes on mice.Next, we subjected the DAPK1-KD−/−, and DAPK1-KDloxp/loxp mice with MCAO for 60 min and performed MRI studies 24 h after reperfusion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a marked reduction of infarction area (13.6 ± 4.2 mm3) when compared with the control DAPK1-KDloxp/loxp mice (47.8 ± 5.1 mm3) (Fig. <5>A). Furthermore, immunoblotting of infarct brain tissue from the DAPK1-KD−/− mice showed lesser pS262, more PSD95, GluA1, and Synapsin1 24 h after ischemia than the DAPK1-KDloxp/loxp mice (Fig. <5>B). Three days after reperfusion, frozen brain sections were prepared and stained with Fluoro-Jade C (FJ) to detect neuronal death, and an unbiased stereological analysis was adopted to measure the FJ-labeled (FJ+) area in the ischemic brain. Much less neuronal death was detected in DAPK1-KD−/− mice compared with DAPK1-KDloxp/loxp mice (Fig. <5>C). The reduction of brain infarction area was associated with alleviated spine loss (Fig. <5>D), improved neurological scores and motor coordination in DAPK1-KD−/− mice (Fig. <5>E,F). These results further confirmed the above-mentioned conclusion that phosphorylation of Tau on Ser262 by DAPK1-KD induces spine damage after ischemia. rhetorical Figure 5.

These results further confirmed the above-mentioned conclusion that phosphorylation of Tau on Ser262 by DAPK1-KD induces spine damage after ischemia. Given that we have confirmed the interaction of DAPK1-KD with the microtubule repeat binding domain 1 of Tau (R1D) consisting of amino acids IGSTENLK, we hope to further explore the significance of the association. To this end, we generated a membrane-permeable peptide by fusing the peptide IGSTENLK to the transduction domain of the HIV TAT protein, named TAT-R1D. The HPLC graph and parameters of the purified peptide IGSTENLK are shown in Supplementary Figure S5A. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was fused to the terminal of TAT-R1D to visualize neuronal uptake of the peptide. We operated adult male mice with MCAO for 60 min followed by reperfusion. Three hours later, animals were intravenously (i.v.) administered with a single dose of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg TAT-R1D, scrambled control peptide (TAT-s-R1D) or vehicle control (saline) (Fig. <6>A, upper panel). Our data showed that intravenous injection-induced uptake of TAT-R1D into neuronal cells, but not microglia or astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S5B). At a dose of 2 mg/kg (i.v.), TAT-R1D effectively disrupted the DAPK1-Tau association in brain tissues (Fig. <6>B). To evaluate the intervention time window, we administered mice with TAT-R1D (2 mg/kg, i.v.) at 3 indicated time points (3, 6, and 9 h after reperfusion) (Fig. <6>A, lower panel). Three and six hours after reperfusion, TAT-R1D was effective in dissociating DAPK1-Tau interaction (Fig. <6>C). These results indicate that the 2 mg/kg (i.v.) may be used as an effective dose and 6 h after reperfusion may be taken for proper treatment time window. rhetorical Figure 6.

These results indicate that the 2 mg/kg (i.v.) may be used as an effective dose and 6 h after reperfusion may be taken for proper treatment time window. To investigate the protective effects of TAT-R1D against spine damage after stroke, we examined the levels of pS262 and synaptic-related proteins. After treatment with TAT-R1D (2 mg/kg body weight, i.v.) 6 h after MCAO, immunoblotting of extraction of cortex tissue 24 h after MCAO showed inhibition in pS262 expression (Fig. <6>D), prevention of the loss of both postsynaptic (PSD-95 and GluA1) and presynaptic proteins (Synapsin1) (Fig. <6>E). Consistently, the reduction in both amplitude and frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSC after MCAO was rescued by TAT-R1D application (Fig. <6>F).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4816799_6,"These results demonstrate that TAT-R1D is effective and efficient in blocking ischemia-induced spine damage To further confirm whether TAT-R1D might be used as a potential neuroprotective agent in stroke, MCAO surgery or photothrombosis (PT) by cold light illumination was performed to induce focal cerebral ischemia. Six hours after ischemia, mice were administered with TAT-R1D, TAT-s-R1D, or vehicle. The brain infarct was measured 3 days later with TTC staining. We found that TAT-R1D at a single dose of 2 mg/kg bodyweight (i.v.) sufficiently decreased the cerebral infarction compared with mice treated with TAT-s-R1D or vehicle (Fig. <6>G and Supplementary Fig. S5C). Furthermore, TAT-R1D treatment markedly improved the overall behavioral functions including neurological score (N.S.) (Supplementary Fig. S5D), Morris water maze (Supplementary Fig. S5E), and open-field test (Supplementary Fig. S5F) analyzed 7 days post-ischemia. Together, our data demonstrate that blockade of DAPK1-Tau interaction by TAT-R1D administration may be a promising target for stroke treatment. Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality; however, effective measures to minimize brain damage and improve recovery are still lacking. Evidence from a number of studies suggests that spine damage is a preceding neuropathological process contributing to neuronal injury after stroke. This drives us to search for new targets for neuroprotection in the earlier stage of stroke. In the present study, we provide the first evidence that DAPK1-Tau interaction mediates spine damage and neuronal death in cerebral ischemic stroke. Our work also uncovers specific Tau-directed kinase DAPK1, which causes spine damage by phosphorylating Tau at Ser-262 (pS262) in the brain with ischemic insults. More importantly, treatment with TAT-R1D (IGSTENLK) results in effective dissociation of DAPK1-Tau complexes, causing a significantly decrease in the level of pS262, and apparent alleviation of infarction area as well as the neurological deficits induced by cerebral ischemic stroke. Thus, blocking DAPK1-Tau interaction could be a promising target for developing potential therapy for ischemic stroke.Spine loss is prior to neuronal loss in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Diseases, Parkinson Disease. Failure of synaptic transmission can be observed within minutes following hypoxia (<Corcoran and O'Connor 2013>). Our results are consistent with the previous report that spine damage is a preceding neuropathological process contributing to neuronal injury after stroke, possibly due to the high sensitivity of synaptic activity to alterations in energy supply (<Khatri and Man 2013>). For example, results from magnetic resonance spectroscopy related the changes in neuroenergetics revealed that more energy were required for functional activation to neurotransmitter cycling at the level of the synapse (<Waldvogel et al. 2000>; <Foo et al. 2012>). And the structural and functional integrity of synaptic transmission profoundly depends on a superior oxygen and glucose supply (<Acker and Acker 2004>).Tau alteration, dysfunction, and extensive neuron loss have long been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases (<Brandt et al. 2005>). Abnormal phosphorylation of tau is considered one of the earliest signs of neuronal degeneration and appears to precede tau aggregation (<Braak et al. 1994>). Site-specific phosphorylation of tau can be regulated by concerted and sequential action of many protein kinases (<Stoothoff and Johnson 2005>). Among these protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3β) was the most powerful tau protein kinase (<Jope and Johnson 2004>), which could induce the phosphorylation of tau protein at many sites, such as Ser199/202 (<Leroy et al. 2002>). Transient cerebral ischemia could induce the site-specific hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (<Wen et al. 2004>). Indeed, we only observed the phosphorylation of Ser262, but not Ser199/202 or other previously reported phosphorylation sites (pS202, pS214, pT231, and pS422), indicating the specificity of activation by DAPK1 in cortex after stroke. Changes in tau phosphorylation sites during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are likely due to changes in the activities of specific phosphatases and kinases (<Mailliot et al. 2000>). In response to ischemia/reperfusion processes, phosphorylation or dephosphophrylation of tau protein appears to be dynamically regulated at different time phases (<Burkhart et al. 1998>; <Mailliot et al. 2000>). Additional studies including high-throughput mass spectrum analysis of phophorylated tau in the different areas of brain or at different time points after stroke, as well as detection of phosphatases or kinases enzyme activity are needed to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms.We provide several pieces of evidence supporting a causative role of Tau phosphorylation in mediating dendritic spine injuries in ischemic stroke. The phosphorylation of tau at Ser262 may result in the reduction of its affinity to microtubule protein and promote microtubule depolymerization (<Biernat et al. 1993>), which will inhibit axonal transport, destabilize neuronal cytoskeleton, and may contribute to the apoptotic process induced by this ischemia/reperfusion insult. In addition, abnormally phosphorylated tau protein is less likely to be hydrolyzed by the proteolylic enzymes and slow in degradation (<Gong et al. 2000>), resulting in the accumulation in the neurons and the possible formation of indissolvable tau. Those are the possible causes of the increasing of tau in dentritic spines and damage of synapes during ischemia/reperfusion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau protein is involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of cerebral ischemia, and therefore interrupting tau phosphorylation may become the target for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.During ischemic stroke, DAPK1 is activated in the postsynaptic area and phosphorylates NMDA receptor NR2B protein at Serine-1303 and finally contributes to neuronal death (<Tu et al. 2010>). Our results show the DAPK1-mediated Tau phosphorylation is dependent on its KD and show a different mechanism with DAPK1-p53 interaction, in which DAPK1 associates with p53 DNA-binding motif with its DD and is dependent on the activity of DAPK1. Furthermore, DAPK1-p53-induced cell death is caused by converging the mitochondrial-dependent necrosis pathway and transcriptional-dependent apoptosis pathway (<Pei et al. 2014>). Whereas DAPK1-Tau-mediated cell death is mainly through the toxicity of phosphorylated tau and its subsequent damage to spines and synapses. Due to the distinct cell death mechanisms of DAPK1-p53 and DAPK1-Tau interaction, we speculate that Tau or p53 is likely to be the different downstream signal of DAPK1 and mediate respective cell death signals. Whether this is a consequence of DAPK1-dependent potentiation of NR2B-containing NMDARs or direct activation of the neuronal death signaling cascade remains to be investigated.We found that blocking the interaction between DAPK1 and tau by TAT-R1D significantly reduced stroke-induced spine damage and neuronal injury. Furthermore, the transduction of TAT-R1D in the brain tissues occurred rapidly at 3 h after peptide injection and can produce treatment effects up to 6 h after stroke. The therapeutic time window for most neuroprotective agents in stroke is often <4 h following the onset of stroke. Since the blood brain barrier (BBB) often remains intact during the 4-h therapeutic window, any neuroprotective agent that is developed for stroke therapy must be able to cross the intact BBB if administered systemically (<Joliot and Prochiantz 2004>). In addition, targeted delivery remains a challenge with regard to the application of this technology because TAT fusion proteins administered systemically might also be distributed to other organs, such as liver, kidney, spleen, lung, bowel, and heart, which might cause unexpected side effects (<Kilic et al. 2006>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4816799_7,"Fortunately, it has been found that the distribution of the TAT-RID in many organs has no apparent side effects in the mice (data not shown)  Therefore, the fusion peptide TAT-R1D may be a promising agent for future research in stroke with potential clinical application.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tau at Serine 262 by the KD of DAPK1 mediates spine damage and the subsequent neuronal death in ischemic stroke. Blocking the interaction between DAPK1 and Tau by small peptide of Tau (IGSTENLK) reduces the level of pS262 and prevents spine damage and the followed ischemic brain injury. Thus, preventing the DAPK1-Tau pathway by Tat-R1D could be a potential strategy for treating cerebral ischemic stroke. Supplementary material can be found at: http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org.

Synaptic spine loss is one of the major preceding consequences of stroke damages, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that a direct interaction of DAPK1 with Tau causes spine loss and subsequently neuronal death in a mouse model with stroke. We found that DAPK1 phosphorylates Tau protein at Ser262 (pS262) in cortical neurons of stroke mice. Either genetic deletion of DAPK1 kinase domain (KD) in mice (DAPK1-KD−/−) or blocking DAPK1-Tau interaction by systematic application of a membrane permeable peptide protects spine damages and improves neurological functions against stroke insults. Thus, disruption of DAPK1-Tau interaction is a promising strategy in clinical management of stroke. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histone deacetylases (s) are promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of , while the specific  isoforms associated with cognitive improvement are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of 3 in the pathogenesis of . Nuclear 3 is significantly increased in the hippocampus of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old swe/1dE9 (/1) mice compared with that in age‐matched wild‐type C57/6 (B6) mice. Lentivirus ‐mediated inhibition or overexpression of HDAC3 was used in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice to investigate the role of 3 in spatial memory, amyloid burden, dendritic spine density, glial activation and tau phosphorylation. Inhibition of 3 in the hippocampus attenuates spatial memory deficits, as indicated in the Morris water maze test, and decreases amyloid plaque load and Aβ levels in the brains of /1 mice. Dendritic spine density is increased, while microglial activation is alleviated after 3 inhibition in the hippocampus of 9‐month‐old /1 mice. Furthermore, 3 overexpression in the hippocampus increases Aβ levels, activates microglia, and decreases dendritic spine density in 6‐month‐old /1 mice. In conclusion, our results indicate that 3 negatively regulates spatial memory in /1 mice and 3 inhibition might represent a potential therapy for the treatment of . Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia among the elderly, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 5.3 million people in the United States (Alzheimer's's, <2015>). Although the precise mechanisms of AD are largely unknown, the deposition of beta‐amyloid (Aβ) is a key neuropathological hallmark. AD is closely associated with synaptic dysfunction, glial reactivity, and neuronal loss (Selkoe & Hardy, <2016>). Aβ is derived from the proteolytic metabolism of transmembrane β‐amyloid precursor protein (APP). In the amyloidogenic pathway, Aβ is produced by sequential cleavage of APP by β‐secretase and γ‐secretase; in the nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is consecutively cleaved by α‐secretase and γ‐secretase, which yields smaller Aβ fragments and neuroprotective sAPPα (Selkoe, <2013>). In addition, Aβ clearance by enzyme‐mediated transport and degrading contributes to the dynamic balance of Aβ in the brain (Miners et al., <2011>).Histone acetylation, which is modulated by the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD by altering chromatin structure and accessibility (Peixoto & Abel, <2013>). The level of histone acetylation is significantly lower in both AD transgenic mice and postmortem human brains (Francis et al., <2009>; Narayan et al., <2015>). Compelling evidence has shown that targeting histone acetylation with HDAC inhibitors may improve synaptic plasticity and memory functions in AD models (Kilgore et al., <2010>; Benito et al., <2015>; Rumbaugh et al., <2015>). Although some HDAC inhibitors are approved for the treatment of tumors by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, the side effects of HDAC pan‐inhibitors limit their use (Duvic & Dimopoulos, <2016>). Thus, the identification of a HDAC isoform specifically for the improvement of memory deficits would be of great value.Histone deacetylase 3 is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is able to translocate between them, while other class I HDACs are mainly located in the nucleus (Yang et al., <2002>). Additionally, HDAC3 is widely expressed in the brain and is considered neurotoxic. Overexpression of HDAC3 induces the death of cerebellar granule neurons, while inhibition of HDAC3 protects against the effects of low potassium (Bardai & D'Mello, <2011>). Inhibition of HDAC3 significantly enhances long‐term memory in object recognition tasks (McQuown et al., <2011>). HDAC3 also negatively regulates cocaine‐induced conditioned place preference acquisition (Malvaez et al., <2013>). RGFP966, a selective HDAC3 inhibitor, has been shown to affect sensory cortical plasticity and memory formation (Bieszczad et al., <2015>). However, whether HDAC3 contributes to the development of AD is still debatable (Graff et al., <2012>; Rumbaugh et al., <2015>; Krishna et al., <2016>). In this study, we investigated whether HDAC3 modulates spatial memory and pathogenesis in an AD mouse model. Given that class I HDACs play critical roles in synaptic function and memory formation, we first determined the levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. As shown in Fig. <1>A–D, the protein levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 were not altered in the hippocampus of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice (P > 0.05). The expression of HDAC8 appeared much lower than that of the other class I HDACs, which was consistent with previous studies (Broide et al., <2007>; Anderson et al., <2015>). In addition, the mRNA level of HDAC3 was not significantly changed in the hippocampus of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice (P > 0.05; Fig. <S1>). The subcellular distribution of HDAC3 was examined next as, unlike other class I HDACs mainly located in the nucleus, HDAC3 has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Yang et al., <2002>). The protein level of HDAC3 was significantly increased in the hippocampal nuclei of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. <1>E,F), which indicated that the increase in HDAC3 in the nuclei might be associated with the pathogenesis of AD. rhetorical Figure 1 Nuclear histone deacetylase 3 (3) is increased in the hippocampus of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old APPswe/PS1dE9 (/1) mice.

Thus, these results showed that HDAC3 was a negative regulator of spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice. To determine whether the memory improvement induced by HDAC3 inhibition was associated with Aβ levels, the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after the injection of lentivirus were examined by ELISA. In the TBS fractions (soluble Aβ), inhibition of HDAC3 significantly decreased the level of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the hippocampus (P < 0.001; Fig. <3>A,B). In addition, the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in TBS‐X and FA fractions (plaque‐associated Aβ) were decreased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (P < 0.001; Fig. <3>A,B), which indicated that the inhibition of HDAC3 could decrease both soluble and insoluble Aβ levels. Next, we investigated whether HDAC3 inhibition regulated the deposition of amyloid plaques using IFA. As shown in Fig. <3>C,D, inhibition of HDAC3 significantly reduced amyloid plaques areas in the brains of APP/PS1 mice (P = 0.001).

To determine the effect of HDAC3 on neuroinflammation, the expression levels of Iba‐1 (a marker of microglia) and GFAP (a marker of astrocyte) were measured using IFA and Western blot. HDAC3 inhibition attenuated the activation of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (P = 0.018; Fig. <5>A–C). The results of Western blot confirmed these data (P < 0.001; Fig. <5>D,E). The level of GFAP was not affected following HDAC3 inhibition or HDAC3 overexpression as demonstrated by IFA and Western blot (Fig. <5> and Fig. <S6>, Supporting information). Furthermore, the level of Iba‐1 was significantly increased in the hippocampus of Lv‐HDAC3‐injected APP/PS1 mice as demonstrated by IFA and Western blot (P = 0.039 and P = 0.032, respectively; Fig. <S6>, Supporting information). In conclusion, HDAC3 negatively regulated the activation of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. rhetorical Figure 5 Inhibition of 3 attenuates microglial activation in the hippocampus of /1 mice.

In conclusion, HDAC3 negatively regulated the activation of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In the current study, we investigate the possible effect of HDAC3 on spatial memory deficits and the pathogenesis of AD, and our data have shown that (i) nuclear HDAC3 is significantly increased in the hippocampus of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice compared with that in age‐matched wild‐type C57BL/6 (B6) mice; (ii) lentivirus‐mediated inhibition of HDAC3 in the hippocampus attenuates spatial memory deficits, decreases amyloid plaque load and Aβ levels, alleviates microglial activation, and increases dendritic spine density in 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice; and (iii) lentivirus‐mediated overexpression of HDAC3 in the hippocampus increases Aβ levels, activates microglia, and decreases dendritic spine density in 6‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, inhibition or overexpression of HDAC3 does not alter the levels of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus of 6‐ and 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice (Fig. <S7>, Supporting information).Histone deacetylase 3 is the only class I HDAC located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and is also found in the plasma membrane (Yang et al., <2002>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5595690_3,"In the nucleus, HDAC3 interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressor and the silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid receptors to regulate transcription and chromatin structure (You et al , <2013>). The role of HDAC3 in the cytoplasm is less studied and might be associated with protein retention and signaling transduction. HDAC3 is cleaved by the caspase‐dependent pathway and translocated to the cytoplasm during apoptosis, while nuclear accumulation of HDAC3 can inhibit the progression of apoptosis (Escaffit et al., <2007>). Increased nuclear, not cytoplasmic HDAC3 has been found in pancreatic cancer tissues and correlated with an advanced clinical stage and worse prognoses (Jiao et al., <2016>). However, whether the subcellular translocation of HDAC3 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD is unknown and needs further study.According to the molecular brake pad hypothesis (McQuown & Wood, <2011>), HDACs act as molecular brake pads by repressing the transcription of genes required for memory formation, and the inhibition of specific HDAC isoforms will increase chromatin accessibility to facilitate transcription‐dependent memory processes. The role of HDAC3 in the pathogenesis of AD is controversial. The expression of HDAC3 is not altered in postmortem AD brains compared with that in healthy controls, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Graff et al., <2012>). HDAC3 inhibition by intraperitoneally injected (IP injected) RGFP966 exerts no effect on synaptogenesis and memory function, while RGFP963, an inhibitor of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, induces synaptogenesis and rescues memory dysfunction in 6‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice, as demonstrated by the contextual fear conditioning test (Rumbaugh et al., <2015>). However, RGFP966 attenuates the impaired long‐term potential (LTP) induced by Aβ1–42 oligomer using whole‐cell voltage‐clamp and field recording techniques (Krishna et al., <2016>). Here, our data provide the first evidence that the inhibition of HDAC3 by lentivirus‐mediated shRNA in the hippocampus attenuates spatial memory deficits and decreases amyloid plaque load and Aβ levels in 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice. We speculate that at least the three following reasons contribute to the inconsistence of these studies: (i) lentivirus‐mediated inhibition of HDAC3 is used in this study, which inhibits not only deacetylase activity but also the expression of HDAC3 (considering that HDAC3 also has several deacetylase‐independent functions (Sun et al., <2013>; Adikesavan et al., <2014>), inhibition of the expression using a genetic knockout or knockdown approach might be more reasonable); (ii) RGFP966 is IP injected for 12 days at a dose of 30 mg kg−1 as previously described, but the time‐dependent and dose‐dependent effects of RGFP966 on the memory function of APP/PS1 mice are not shown; and (iii) although contextual fear conditioning and MWM tests are generally considered hippocampus‐dependent tasks, there are different brain regions involved, which might lead to inconsistent results (Puzzo et al., <2014>). Interestingly, inhibition of HDAC3 activity by RGFP966 augments LTP and re‐establishes synaptic tagging and capture in aged hippocampal CA1 neurons (Sharma et al., <2015>), which indicated that HDAC3 might contribute to both normal aging and AD pathogenesis.Histone deacetylase inhibition has been shown to alter the dynamic of Aβ production and clearance. TSA increases the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the plasma of 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice, which indicates that it might facilitate the clearance of Aβ from the brain (Yang et al., <2014>). Valproic acid (VPA), another pan‐HDAC inhibitor, reduces Aβ levels and inhibits plaque formation in APP23 and APP23/PS45 mice (Qing et al., <2008>). Our results also demonstrate that inhibition of HDAC3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice decreases Aβ levels and alleviates amyloid plaque formation, which might be associated with decreased PS‐1 levels. An autosomal dominant mutation of PS‐1/PS‐2 leads to the early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), and the PS1 complex displays greater γ‐secretase activity than the PS2 complex (Lai et al., <2003>), which indicates that PS1 might be a critical catalytic component of γ‐secretase. Therefore, further studies are warranted to investigate the possible role of PS1 in HDAC3 inhibition‐mediated neuroprotective effects.Previous studies have demonstrated that synaptic dysfunction appears in the early stages of AD, and different Aβ species, including amyloid plaques and intracellular Aβ, are associated with the synapse loss (Herms & Dorostkar, <2016>). Here, we have shown that inhibition of HDAC3 regulates the synapse‐associated proteins synaptophysin, p‐CREB, and BDNF in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and significantly increases spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons. It was a limitation of our study that the particular types of dendritic spines and the correlation with the synaptic function were not analyzed. Previous studies have shown that RGFP966 ameliorates Aβ1‐42 oligomer‐induced LTP impairment in both single cell and a population of cells among the CA1 pyramidal neurons (Krishna et al., <2016>), which is consistent with our results. However, systemic delivery of RGFP966 exerts no effect on spine density and the maturation of synaptic function (Rumbaugh et al., <2015>). As HDAC3−/− mice are embryonically lethal, conditional HDAC3 knockout mice might be used for further studies.The activation of microglia and the release of proinflammatory factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. The reactive microglia surround Aβ plaques in the brains of patients with AD, and Aβ induces the reactivation of microglia both in vitro and in vivo (Calsolaro & Edison, <2016>). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of microglia attenuates contextual memory in AD mice without altering the amyloid levels (Spangenberg et al., <2016>), which indicates that the protective effects might not be mediated by amyloid pathology. Recent studies have demonstrated that the R47H variant of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a receptor expressed in microglia, significantly increases the risk of nonfamilial AD (Guerreiro et al., <2013>; Jonsson et al., <2013>). In this study, our data demonstrate that HDAC3 inhibition in APP/PS1 mice results in a significant decrease in reactive microglia, while it does not alter astrocytosis. Furthermore, our recent data have shown that inhibition of HDAC3 by RGFP966 attenuates LPS‐induced primary microglia reactivation and Toll‐like receptor signaling pathway in vitro, which might be associated with the phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3 (Xia et al., <2017>). Considering that inhibition of HDAC3 attenuated the amyloid pathology, whether the ameliorated microgliosis is directly regulated by HDAC3 inhibition requires further studies. Nonetheless, the anti‐inflammatory effect of HDAC3 inhibition on APP/PS1 mice indicates that it might be a potential target for AD treatment.In conclusion, our data show that inhibition of HDAC3 ameliorates spatial memory impairment and improves AD‐related neuropathogenesis, while HDAC3 overexpression increases the amyloid burden in AD mice, which suggests that inhibition of HDAC3 is a potential therapy for the treatment of AD. APP/PS1 mice were obtained from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University, and age‐matched B6 mice were used as controls. The delta exon 9 variant of PS1 specifically produces Aβ1–42, which is more prone to aggregation and leads to an earlier onset of amyloid plaques. APP/PS1 mice display visible amyloid plaques at 5–6 months of age, and memory deficits are detected at later stages (Jankowsky et al., <2004>). Male and female APP/PS1 mice with similar numbers were used in this study. The lentivirus that overexpressed or inhibited HDAC3 was purchased from Shanghai Genchem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5595690_4,"The HDAC3‐RNAi lentivirus (lenti‐shHDAC3, 5 × 108 TU mL−1, forward: 5′‐CCGGCCTGCATTATGGTCTCTATAACTCGAGTTATAGAGACCATAATGCAGGTTTTTG‐3′, reverse: 5′‐AATTCAAAAACCTGCATTATGGTCTCTATAACTCGAGTTATAGAGACCATAATGCAGG‐3′) or the control lentivirus (lenti‐shcon, 5 × 108 TU mL−1) was slowly injected into the bilateral hippocampus (anterior–posterior position−2 0 mm, medial–lateral position ± 1.6 mm, dorsoventral 1.5 mm from bregma) of 9‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice via infusion cannulae as previously described (Zhu et al., <2014>), while the lentivirus overexpressing HDAC3 (lenti‐HDAC3) or the control lentivirus (lenti‐con) was injected into the bilateral hippocampus of 6‐month‐old APP/PS1 mice. The MWM tests were performed 30 days after the lentivirus injection, and the brains were then removed for the other experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Nanjing University, and every effort was made to minimize the number of experimental animals and their suffering. Total RNA was harvested using the TRIzol reagent (Takara, Dalian, Liaoning, China) from the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and was reverse‐transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara). Real‐time PCR was performed using SYBR Fast qPCR Mix (Takara) on an ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The mRNA level of HDAC3 was normalized to that of GAPDH. The primers were as follows: HDAC3: forward, TTCAACGTGGGTGATGACTG, reverse, TTAGCTGTGTTGCTCCTTGC; GAPDH: forward, GCCAAGGCTGTGGGCAAGGT, reverse, TCTCCAGGCGGCACGTCAGA. Nuclear protein was extracted using a Nuclear Extract Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The whole‐cell lysate or nuclear protein was subjected to SDS‐PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: HDAC1 (1:1000; Bioworlde, Louis Park, MN, USA), HDAC2 (1:1000; Bioworlde), HDAC3 (1:1000; Bioworlde), HDAC3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), HDAC8 (1:1000; Bioworlde), APP (1:5000; Sigma), ADAM10 (1:1000; Millipore), ADAM17 (1:1000; Millipore), BACE1 (1:1000; Chemicon), Nicastrin (1:1000; Cell Signaling), PEN2 (1:500; Cell Signaling), presenilin 1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling), presenilin 2 (1:500; Cell Signaling), C99 (1:1000; Millipore), Aβ (6E10, 1:1000; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), IDE (1:1000; Abcam), NEP (1:1000; Millipore), LRP1 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), RAGE (1:1000; Abcam), cathepsin B (1:1000; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), p‐CREB (1:1000; Cell Signaling), CREB (1:1000; Cell Signaling), synaptophysin (1:1000; Abcam), BDNF (1:1000; Bioworlde), PSD95 (1:1000; Cell Signaling), PSD93 (1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), GFAP (1:1000; Abcam), Iba‐1 (1:1000; Abcam), AT180 (1:5000; Thermo Fisher), AT270 (1:5000; Thermo Fisher, Lafayette, CO, USA), AT8 (1:5000; Thermo Fisher), AT100 (1:5000; Thermo Fisher), Tau (1:1000; Thermo Fisher), GAPDH (1:5000; Bioworlde), and lamin B (1:1000; Bioworlde). The membranes were washed with TBS‐T and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The protein signals were detected using an ECL system (Bioworlde), and the band intensities were quantified using imagej software, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/,NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA . APP/PS1 mice were anesthetized and perfused with cold saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain sections were blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibodies: Iba‐1 (1:400; Abcam), GFAP (1:400; BD), and Aβ (1:200; Biolegend) at 4°C, followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with DAPI reagent (Bioworlde). Qualitative immunostaining analyses were conducted as previously described (Zhao et al., <2013>). The immunoreactive cells to GFAP and Iba‐1 in about 100 areas of 1 × 1 mm in five slices per brain were counted. The Aβ plaque load was determined by imagej software and expressed as the percent of total brain area for each slice. All procedures were performed in a randomized and blinded manner. Soluble and insoluble Aβ in the brains were sequentially extracted as described elsewhere (Youmans et al., <2011>). In brief, brains were homogenized in 15 volumes (w/v) of TBS buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) and then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was collected as the TBS‐soluble fraction (soluble Aβ). The pellet was resuspended in 15 volumes of 1% Triton X‐100/TBS (TBS‐X), incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was removed as the TBS‐X‐soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 70% formic acid (FA) and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was neutralized with 1 M Tris base (pH 11), representing the FA‐soluble fraction (insoluble Aβ). The protein levels of the TBS‐soluble and TBS‐X‐soluble fractions were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Bioworlde), and the protein levels of the FA‐soluble fractions were detected using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bioworlde). The levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in each fraction were quantified using Quantikine ELISA Human Amyloid β aa1‐40/aa1‐42 Immunoassay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Golgi staining was performed using an FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (FD Neurotechnologies, Columbia, MD, USA) as previously described (Wang et al., <2016>). Briefly, brain tissues were immersed in impregnation solution consisting equal volumes of Solutions A and B for 2 weeks and then removed to Solution C for 3 days at room temperature in the dark. Brain sections (200 μm thickness) were placed on Solution C‐coated microscope slides and transferred into in a mixture including DDW, Solution D and Solution E for 10 min, then rinsed in DDW, dehydrated, dried, cleared and covered with coverslips. The sections were observed using an OLYMPUS BX51 microscope, and the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were analyzed. For each mouse, five neurons were randomly selected, and three segments (at least 30 μm) were randomly chosen per neuron from the apical and basal dendrites, and the numbers of spines per 10 μm were counted in a blinded manner using imagej software. The MWM tests were performed as previously reported (Zhu et al., <2014>). Briefly, during the acquisition trial (days 1–5), each mouse was trained to find a submerged platform within 60 s, and the latency, swimming speed and searching distance were recorded using any‐maze software (Stoelting, USA). If the mouse found the platform within 60 s, the time was recorded as the latency. Otherwise, the mouse was gently guided to the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 10 s, and the latency was recorded as 60 s. For the probe trial (day 6), the platform was removed and the mouse was allowed to swim freely for 60 s; the number of target platform crossings and the time spent and swimming distances in each quadrant were recorded. All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) and analyzed using spss 18.0. Differences in escape latency, searching distance and swimming speed in the MWM tests were analyzed using two‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and all other data were analyzed using Student's t‐test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
