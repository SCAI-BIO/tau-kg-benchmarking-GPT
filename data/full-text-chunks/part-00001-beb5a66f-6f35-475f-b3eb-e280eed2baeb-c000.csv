PMC5896171_0,"In Alzheimer’s disease, neurofibrillary tangle pathology appears to spread along neuronal connections, proposed to be mediated by the release and uptake of abnormal, disease-specific forms of microtubule-binding protein tau MAPT. It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two entry mechanisms for monomeric tau to human neurons: a rapid dynamin-dependent phase typical of endocytosis and a second, slower actin-dependent phase of macropinocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerization and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate monomeric tau entry into neurons, but less efficiently in the case of aggregated tau, where internalized tau carries antibody with it into neurons. These data suggest that tau entry to human neurons is a physiological process and not a disease-specific phenomenon. rhetorical Extracellular tau protein enters human neurons by endocytosis and micropinocytosis Aggregated tau enters human neurons primarily by endocytosis Tau antibodies reduce uptake and are carried into neurons by tau Findings suggest that tau uptake is dependent on carrier proteins or receptors In contrast with predictions that transfer of the microtubule-associated protein tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia, Evans et al. show that healthy human neurons efficiently take up both normal and aggregated tau, by distinct but overlapping uptake mechanisms.

The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is involved in the pathogenesis of several forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in the MAPT gene are causal for some familial forms of FTD (<Ghetti et al., 2015>), and the formation of intracellular, hyperphoshorylated aggregates of tau (neurofibrillary tangles [NFTs]) is a common pathological feature in AD, FTD, and other dementias (<Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986>, <Kosik et al., 1986>). Disease progression, and clinical severity of symptoms, is associated with a predictable spatial and temporal order of appearance of NFTs in different forebrain regions (<Braak and Braak, 1991>). This has led to the proposal that these diseases actively spread from diseased to healthy neurons in a spatial and temporal progression, mediated by extracellular, abnormal, disease-associated forms of tau (<Iba et al., 2013>, <Liu et al., 2012>).It is not currently known if neuronal release and internalization of extracellular tau are disease-specific phenomena that spread disease through the CNS or are fundamental physiological processes. In vivo, tau protein is present in interstitial fluid of the CNS and passes into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it is found in concentrations on the order of 15 pM (<Blennow et al., 1995>, <Olsson et al., 2005>). Mice transgenic for human tau have 10-fold higher concentrations of tau in brain interstitial fluid than in CSF, which would suggest that the extracellular concentrations of tau in the human brain are in the high picomolar-low nanomolar range (<Yamada et al., 2011>). There is strong evidence for the regulated release of non-pathogenic forms of tau from healthy neurons and of tau entry into neurons and non-neuronal cells (<Bright et al., 2015>, <Chai et al., 2012>, <Kanmert et al., 2015>, <Wang et al., 2017>). There have been conflicting reports about the ability of extracellular monomeric tau to enter cells, whereas aggregated or fibrillar tau has been clearly shown to efficiently enter neurons and other cell types (<Frost et al., 2009>, <Kfoury et al., 2012>, <Wu et al., 2013>).We used human stem cell-derived neurons to address open questions about the efficiency with which tau enters human neurons, which forms (monomeric and aggregated) of tau enter neurons, and the routes by which they do so. We found that both forms of tau are efficiently taken up by human neurons, by overlapping but distinct mechanisms, consistent with regulated endocytosis. Monomeric tau enters neurons by two different routes and is actively trafficked within the neuron. Tau entry into neurons can be attenuated by antibody binding, however, extracellular tau-antibody complexes are internalized into intracellular compartments. We first analyzed the ability of monomeric and aggregated tau (P301S) proteins to enter human cortical neurons from the extracellular milieu. We used the tau P301S variant, an autosomal dominant mutation that causes early onset FTD with high penetrance (<Bugiani et al., 1999>, <Guo et al., 2017>). Focusing on P301S tau enabled us to study the transmission of a disease-relevant, aggregation-prone variant that differs from normal tau by a single amino acid, comparing monomeric and aggregated forms directly.To do so, purified recombinant monomeric (native) or heparin-aggregated tau proteins conjugated to an amide reactive fluorophore (tau-Dylight 488 NHS ester) were incubated with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral cortex excitatory neurons for 2 hr (<Figure 1>A; <Figures S1> and <S2>). After extensive washing, monomeric and aggregated tau-Dylight were both detected within cells expressing the neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein MAP2, confirming that both forms of tau enter neurons. Tau-Dylight was found predominantly within the somatic compartment of neurons (<Figure 1>A). After a 4-hr incubation with extracellular tau, flow cytometry analysis (<Figures 1>B and 1C) revealed that 83% and 73% of dissociated cells contained monomeric or aggregated tau-Dylight, respectively, demonstrating that extracellular tau efficiently enters human neurons in culture. Internalization of monomeric tau (P301S) and wild-type tau was comparable and concentration dependent (<Figure S3>A), confirming that the P301S mutation does not confer the ability to efficiently enter neurons, nor is this form of tau likely to aggregate in extracellular media during the 3- to 4-hr incubation period. Tau derivatives and oligomeric states had no significant cytotoxic effect over the course of the assays (3–4 hr; <Figures S3>B and S3C). rhetorical Figure 1 Human Neurons Efficiently Internalize Extracellular Monomeric and Aggregated Tau(A) Neuronal uptake of extracellular monomeric or aggregated forms of tau P301S protein conjugated to an amide-reactive fluorophore (green in merge; tau-Dylight) after 2 hr of incubation or without tau protein (no tau added).

Tau derivatives and oligomeric states had no significant cytotoxic effect over the course of the assays (3–4 hr; <Figures S3>B and S3C). Live imaging of human cortical neurons was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of neuronal entry of monomeric and aggregated tau. To do so, we prepared purified recombinant tau P301S protein conjugated to a maleimide-reactive pH-sensitive dye (tau-pHrodo Red), a reporter detectable in low-pH environments, including late endosomes and lysosomes. Incubation of tau-pHrodo with human neurons at a range of concentrations from 2.5 to 25 nM (0.12–1.2 μg.mL−1, diluted in culture medium) showed that tau entry to neurons is rapid, as visualized by live imaging. As we found with the amine-labeled tau-Dylight that conjugates the dye to lysine residues, maleimide-labeled tau-pHrodo (which conjugates to cysteine residues) showed concentration-dependent internalization, indicating that the position and chemical nature of each dye does not impact uptake.To confirm that the dyes do not enable tau to enter neurons, we added FLAG-tagged tau with no fluorescent labels to human neurons, and we purified FLAG-tagged, intracellular tau from neurons at 24-hr intervals over a 4-day period using anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. We found that FLAG-tagged tau enters neurons efficiently and that internalized tau persists at detectable levels within neurons for at least 4 days (<Figure S4>A). 3R and 4R splice isoforms of tau have one and two cysteines, respectively, enabling the production of forms of tau containing one or two pHrodo labels per tau molecule. We found that these two forms of pHrodo-tau differed approximately 2-fold in their fluorescent signal when added at the same concentration to human neurons, demonstrating the overall efficiency of protein labeling and the scaling of the fluorescent signal to intracellular tau entry (<Figure S4>B).Intracellular fluorescent punctae were observed within the first 10 min of exposure of neurons to monomeric tau-pHrodo (<Figure 2>A; <Video S1>). Tau-pHrodo-positive structures increased in size and intensity over the 4-hr course of the assay. These structures were present within neurites and accumulated in the cell bodies of neurons. In the presence of 15 and 25 nM monomeric tau-pHrodo, the number of tau-pHrodo-positive objects approached a plateau (>90% of final measurement) after approximately 1 hr (<Figure 2>C). rhetorical Figure 2 Human Neurons Internalize Extracellular Tau via Low-pH Intracellular Vesicles in a Concentration-Dependent Manner(A) Time-lapse (0- to 4-hr) images showing concentration-dependent uptake of extracellular monomeric tau P301S conjugated to a pH-sensitive dye (tau-pHrodo [2.5, 15, or 25 nM]; inverse relationship between fluorescence and pH) into iPSC-derived human neurons (75 days after induction).

PMC5896171_2,"However, unlike monomeric tau-pHrodo, the number of detectable tau-pHrodo-positive objects (<Figure 2>F) did not increase immediately but displayed a lag for the first hour (<Figure 2>E)  These kinetics of aggregated tau-pHrodo entry are similar to that of both lower concentrations of monomeric tau (2.5 nM) and of low-molecular weight (10-kDa) dextran-pHrodo (same molarity as monomeric tau samples; <Figures S5>A–S5C). Direct quantitative comparison of the amount of monomeric and aggregated tau-pHrodo entering at different concentrations is not possible under these experimental conditions, as the mixed nature of aggregated tau fibrils prevents us from establishing molarity accurately. We confirmed that heparin within the aggregated tau preparations did not contribute to tau entry into neurons, finding that uptake of both monomeric and aggregated tau was unaffected in the presence of heparin (<Figures S4>C and S4D). To establish the route of vesicular internalization of monomeric and aggregated tau, we analyzed the appearance of tau-Dylight in endosomal or lysosomal compartments in iPSC-derived human neurons. Monomeric or aggregated tau-Dylight (total protein concentration 10 μg.mL−1, ∼250 nM) was incubated with neurons for up to 6 hr, then extensively washed to remove extracellular protein and fixed.

Co-localization of tau with endosomes (early endosomal antigen-1 [EEA1] immunofluorescence; <Figure 3>A) or late endosomes and lysosomes (LAMP1 immunofluorescence; <Figure 3>B) was analyzed by confocal microscopy.In agreement with the monomeric tau-pHrodo experiments, monomeric tau-Dylight was rapidly taken up into neurons (<Figure 3>C). In contrast, IgG-Dylight showed little detectable entry into neurons throughout the time course (data not shown). As early as 1 hr after the addition of extracellular tau, monomeric and aggregated tau-Dylight were co-localized in EEA1+ early endosomes. Monomeric and aggregated tau-Dylight were also detected in LAMP1+ late endosomes and lysosomes, consistent with endocytosed proteins first reaching early endosomes, before late endosomes and lysosomes.Live imaging (<Figure 3>G; <Video S2>) of neurons incubated with aggregated tau-pHrodo (4 hr, 0.7 μg.mL−1) enabled the longer-term tracking of tau-pHrodo-containing vesicles within neurons. Tau-containing vesicles were rapidly (>10 μm/s) transported in both antero- and retrograde directions along neurites, and they could rapidly reverse direction of transport (<Figure 3>G). Thus, monomeric and aggregated tau both efficiently enter neurons via the endosome/lysosome system, and they are actively trafficked within vesicles over long distances within neurons over several hours. As extracellular monomeric and aggregated tau utilize endosomal pathways to enter neurons but display different kinetics of uptake, we examined whether the underlying internalization mechanisms of tau protein species differ. First, we tested the sensitivity of monomeric and aggregated tau internalization to the small molecule inhibitor Dynasore (<Figure 4>), an inhibitor of the GTPase dynamin, which is required for numerous membrane fission events, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<Preta et al., 2015>). Following 30-min pre-incubation with 100 μM Dynasore or vehicle control, entry of extracellular monomeric (25 nM) or aggregated tau-pHrodo (1.2 μg.mL−1) was assessed by live imaging over 4 hr. rhetorical Figure 4 Monomeric and Aggregated Tau Enter Neurons via Different Mechanisms(A) Time-lapse (0- to 4-hr) imaging of human neuronal uptake of extracellular monomeric and aggregated tau P301S-pHrodo following dynamin inhibition.

PMC5896171_3,"This was also reflected in the significant reduction in the number of tau-pHrodo-positive objects at 1 hr (compared with vehicle control; <Figure 4>C)  The kinetics of appearance of intracellular monomeric tau-pHrodo objects changed in the presence of dynamin inhibitor, displaying an initial lag in entry. However, the number of tau-pHrodo objects then reached the same level as vehicle-treated controls by 3 hr, although not the same total intensity (<Figure 4>C), which may reflect a reduction in endosome/lysosome acidification in the presence of Dynasore. This suggests that there are two distinct mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau into human neurons, one of which is rapid and dynamin dependent and the other being slower and independent of dynamin.The effect of dynamin inhibition on the entry of aggregated tau was more pronounced than on monomeric tau (<Figures 4>D–4F). The total fluorescent intensity of intracellular aggregated tau-pHrodo was consistently reduced by more than 70% at 1 and 3 hr after tau addition (<Figure 4>E), and the number of tau-pHrodo-positive objects was reduced by 95% (<Figure 4>F). These data indicate that, at the concentrations studied, aggregated tau enters neurons almost entirely via endocytosis. To explore further whether monomeric and aggregated tau enter neurons via different mechanisms, we studied the role of actin polymerization in this process (<Figure 5>). Inhibition of actin polymerization with Cytochalasin D disrupts several clathrin-independent endocytic processes, including bulk endocytosis/macropinocytosis (<Mooren et al., 2012>). Disruption of actin polymerization has previously been shown to inhibit entry of fibrils formed of the tau repeat domain (<Holmes et al., 2013>). Therefore, neuronal entry of tau-pHrodo was measured over 3 hr in the presence of extracellular monomeric (25 nM) or aggregated (1.2 μg.mL−1) tau-pHrodo, following a 30-min pre-incubation with 0.1 or 1 μM Cytochalasin D or vehicle control. rhetorical Figure 5 Perturbation of Actin Polymerization Confirms that Monomeric and Aggregated Tau Enter Neurons through Distinct Uptake Mechanisms(A) Time-lapse (0- to 3-hr) imaging of human neuronal uptake of extracellular monomeric and aggregated tau P301S-pHrodo following the inhibition of actin polymerization.

Disruption of actin polymerization has previously been shown to inhibit entry of fibrils formed of the tau repeat domain (<Holmes et al., 2013>). Therefore, neuronal entry of tau-pHrodo was measured over 3 hr in the presence of extracellular monomeric (25 nM) or aggregated (1.2 μg.mL−1) tau-pHrodo, following a 30-min pre-incubation with 0.1 or 1 μM Cytochalasin D or vehicle control.Entry of monomeric tau was markedly reduced in the presence of 1 μM Cytochalasin D, as reflected in the 95% reduction in the number of monomeric tau-pHrodo-positive objects after 3-hr incubation in the presence of 1 μM Cytochalasin D (<Figure 5>C). In contrast, disruption of actin polymerization with Cytochalasin D had little effect on the entry of aggregated tau (total fluorescent intensity and number of objects; <Figures 5>D–5F; <Figure S5>).Live imaging of tau entry with pHrodo-tau may not detect intracellular pools of tau that enter via a different mechanism, avoiding low-pH environments. Additionally the pharmacological treatments may also affect the acidification of intracellular vesicles, which could affect the pHrodo signal. To control for this, we performed tau-Dylight internalization assays in the presence of 100 μM Dynasore or 1 μM Cytochalasin D (<Figure S6>), with 3 hr of incubation with 100 μM extracellular monomeric or aggregated tau. Compared with the live-imaging studies, relatively high concentrations of aggregated tau were used to investigate whether the dynamin-dependence and actin-independence of neuronal entry seen by live imaging were related to the lower molarity of aggregated versus monomeric tau used for those experiments. These independent assays confirmed the same differential effects of the two inhibitors observed by live imaging of pHrodo-tau: at the 3-hr assay point, dynamin inhibition had no effect on the number of monomeric tau-Dylight-positive punctae within neurons, whereas inhibition of actin polymerization reduced the amount of intracellular tau by over half (<Figure S6>). Conversely, dynamin inhibition significantly reduced the entry of aggregated tau, with no significant effects of Cytochalasin D (<Figure S6>) at this relatively high molar concentration of aggregated tau. The different pharmacological treatments and control recombinant proteins had no significant cytotoxic effect over the course of the assays (3–4 hr; <Figure S5>). It is not currently known if tau entry into neurons requires specific domains of tau, specific cell surface-binding proteins, or receptors. Antibodies that recognize extracellular tau are a potential therapeutic strategy for slowing disease progression through the CNS by inhibiting tau entry into neurons (<Congdon et al., 2016>, <Gu and Sigurdsson, 2011>). Complex formation between specific antibodies and tau results in an increase in molecular size and may alter or mask uptake recognition sites on tau, thus preventing neuronal entry of tau.We analyzed the ability of a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal half of tau to reduce tau protein entry into human cortical neurons. The anti-tau antibody or control IgGs (250 nM) were incubated with either monomeric (25 nM) or aggregated (1.2 μg.mL−1) tau-pHrodo at approximately 10-fold excess of antibody for 30 min.

Error bars indicate SD and significance was determined using one-way ANOVA (n = 3; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.005, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, Dunnet’s multiple comparisons).(D–F) Effect of tau antibody on the internalization of extracellular aggregated tau-pHrodo into human neurons using the same experimental conditions and analysis parameters as (A). Sum intensity of the pHrodo positive objects (E) and the number of pHrodo positive objects (D) were measured as in (B and C). It is not currently known if tau entry into neurons requires specific domains of tau, specific cell surface-binding proteins, or receptors. Antibodies that recognize extracellular tau are a potential therapeutic strategy for slowing disease progression through the CNS by inhibiting tau entry into neurons (<Congdon et al., 2016>, <Gu and Sigurdsson, 2011>). Complex formation between specific antibodies and tau results in an increase in molecular size and may alter or mask uptake recognition sites on tau, thus preventing neuronal entry of tau.We analyzed the ability of a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal half of tau to reduce tau protein entry into human cortical neurons. The anti-tau antibody or control IgGs (250 nM) were incubated with either monomeric (25 nM) or aggregated (1.2 μg.mL−1) tau-pHrodo at approximately 10-fold excess of antibody for 30 min. Tau-antibody mixtures were then added to iPSC-derived human neurons, and tau entry was assessed by live imaging of fluorescent intracellular tau-pHrodo (<Figure 6>).Pre-incubation with the polyclonal (anti-taupAb) tau antibody reduced the amount of monomeric tau that entered neurons, as assessed by the number of monomeric tau-pHrodo-containing vesicles (<Figure 6>B; <Figure S7>). The kinetics of monomeric tau entry were affected by the presence of tau-specific antibodies, such that an initial lag in the appearance of defined tau-pHrodo-positive objects was observed (<Figure 6>B).Tau antibodies also reduced entry of aggregated tau uptake into human neurons (<Figure 6>C). In the presence of anti-taupAb, the number of aggregated tau-pHrodo vesicles was reduced by more than half (<Figure 6>D; <Figure S7>). IgG antibodies that do not recognize tau appear to have some minor effects on monomeric and aggregated tau entry, which may be due to competition between tau and IgG for endocytosis.The effect of tau antibodies on the entry of tau-Dylight into neurons was also tested (<Figure S7>), using the same concentrations and pre-incubation time as the tau-pHrodo assays. After 3 hr of incubation with antibodies and extracellular monomeric or aggregated tau, neurons were washed, fixed, and the number of intracellular tau-Dylight punctae was quantified. These independent assays confirmed that tau-specific antibodies significantly reduced the amount of tau-Dylight entering neurons (<Figure S7>). Although tau was pre-incubated with a large molar excess of antibodies (10×) before addition to neurons, some monomeric and aggregated tau still entered neurons. This raised the question of whether the tau that entered neurons under these conditions did so in a complex with antibodies or if a fraction of antibody-free tau was available for neuronal entry. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed additional assays using pre-formed aggregated tau-Dylight-antibody complexes. After 3 hr of incubation, antibodies were detected in the fixed neurons with a secondary antibody specific to the host species (anti-rabbit polyclonal; <Figure 7>) and also imaged for tau-Dylight. Intraneuronal punctae positive for both tau-Dylight and tau-specific antibodies were detected after binding of extracellular tau with anti-taupAb, demonstrating that tau-antibody complexes do enter human neurons. No intraneuronal tau-antibody complexes were detected when aggregated tau was incubated with IgG control. rhetorical Figure 7 Aggregated Tau-Antibody Complexes Are Endocytosed by Human NeuronsConfocal microscope images of neuronal uptake of extracellular aggregated tau P301S-Dylight-antibody complexes. Pre-formed (30-min incubation) aggregated tau-Dylight-antibody (anti-taupAb or an IgG control) complexes were added to iPSC-derived neurons (71 days after induction). After 3 hr of incubation, neurons were washed, fixed, and co-stained with antibody specific to the pre-incubation antibodies (donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 or donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 594) and nuclear (DAPI; blue in merge) and dendritic markers (MAP2; white in merge). Scale bar, 100 μm. See also <Figure S7>. Although tau was pre-incubated with a large molar excess of antibodies (10×) before addition to neurons, some monomeric and aggregated tau still entered neurons.

No intraneuronal tau-antibody complexes were detected when aggregated tau was incubated with IgG control. We find here that monomeric wild-type and FTD tau (P301S) and aggregated tau (P301S) all efficiently enter human neurons, arguing that tau entry to neurons is a constitutive biological process and not a disease-specific phenomenon. Both monomeric and aggregated species of tau enter neurons via a dynamin-dependent process, with monomeric tau also entering neurons through a second, slower pathway dependent on actin polymerization. Monomeric and aggregated tau access neurons via the lysosome/endosome system. Internalized tau persists within neurons for a minimum of 4 days, and a fraction of tau is dynamically transported long distances in neurons within low-pH vesicles for lengthy periods. The amount of monomeric and aggregated tau entering neurons is reduced by polyclonal anti-tau antibodies. However, a notable amount of tau enters neurons complexed with antibodies, even in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of antibodies. While antibody binding may affect intracellular trafficking of tau and the final destination of tau within the neuron (<McEwan et al., 2017>), these data demonstrate that simple binding of tau by antibodies is not sufficient to prevent neuronal entry when tau is presented in solution to the neuron.In contrast to earlier reports from HEK cells and primary rodent neurons (<Frost et al., 2009>, <Holmes et al., 2013>, <Wu et al., 2013>), full-length monomeric tau efficiently and rapidly enters healthy human neurons, and it does so as efficiently as aggregated tau. We find that there are two mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau into neurons: a rapid early phase that can be blocked by dynamin inhibition; and a second, slower phase that is actin dependent. These two mechanisms suggest that monomeric tau enters neurons via a rapid saturable dynamin-mediated endocytic mechanism and also by bulk endocytosis (<Loebrich, 2014>). In contrast to monomeric tau, aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerization and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with classic endocytosis. The lack of actin dependence of aggregated tau entry into neurons suggests that it does not enter human neurons via macropinocytosis, as has been reported in non-neuronal cells (<Holmes et al., 2013>)."
PMC5896171_5,"Rapid endocytosis of both monomeric and aggregated tau would typically require one or more specific receptors or carrier molecules, the identities of which are currently unknown  Specific surface receptors have been identified for fibrils of alpha-synuclein (<Mao et al., 2016>), and that receptor shows specificity for aggregated synuclein over the monomeric form, which may suggest that, although both species of tau enter neurons via endocytosis, they may do so through distinct surface receptors. As a largely disordered protein, the most obvious candidate region for recognition for cellular entry of monomeric tau is the highly ordered microtubule-binding region of tau (<Butner and Kirschner, 1991>). Detailed understanding of the different paths of entry for monomeric and aggregated tau, and the regions of tau required for uptake, will be useful for investigating the potential for specifically preventing interneuronal transfer of aggregated tau without interfering with the transfer of non-pathogenic forms.In addition to the importance of these questions for understanding mechanisms of dementia pathogenesis, they also have implications for immunotherapy strategies that target extracellular tau as disease-modifying treatments for dementia. Tau immunotherapy strategies have been shown to alter tau transmission in mouse models (<Congdon et al., 2016>, <Gu and Sigurdsson, 2011>). Proposed mechanisms for tau immunotherapies are epitope, affinity, conformation, and aggregate size dependent. Studies of specific tau immunotherapies have demonstrated that either extracellular (<Yanamandra et al., 2013>) or intracellular (<Gu et al., 2013>, <Nicholls et al., 2017>) tau can be targeted. Antibodies are thought to halt the progression of disease by binding to tau aggregates, triggering their uptake and clearance via either endosomal or proteasome pathways (<Chai et al., 2011>, <Gu et al., 2013>, <Mallery et al., 2010>). Fluid phase (<Funk et al., 2015>) and Fc receptor-mediated (<Congdon et al., 2016>) endocytosis have both been implicated in the uptake of antibody-tau complexes into neurons and microglia. The consequences for the neuron of uptake of antibody-antigen complexes are not clear, and they would depend in part on whether those complexes are degraded or accumulate in the endosome/lysosome or transit to the cytoplasm, where they could be detected by the cytosolic Fc receptor TRIM21 and targeted for degradation (<McEwan et al., 2017>).The data presented here from in vitro experiments suggest that entry of tau into human neurons is an efficient physiological process rather than a disease-specific gain of function. Most current immunotherapy approaches targeting extracellular tau do not distinguish between pathogenic forms of tau that are thought to propagate disease and the forms of extracellular tau that are found in the healthy brain (<Bright et al., 2015>). Disruption of interneuronal transfer of non-pathogenic tau may have deleterious effects, if that transfer has a biological function, which is currently not known. Current clinical trials of anti-tau antibodies have not so far reported deleterious effects relating to the disruption of interneuronal transfer of non-pathogenic tau, and the field awaits the outcomes of longer-term trials. Furthermore, therapeutics that are not selective for extracellular pathogenic forms of tau may not achieve appropriate levels of target engagement in the presence of concentrations of non-pathogenic tau that are higher than those of pathogenic tau. Therefore, it will be important to ascertain the biological functions of neuronal release and internalization of tau. It will also be essential to identify which extracellular tau forms are truly pathogenic to facilitate the rational design of therapies that target interneuronal transfer of tau to prevent disease progression. Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and iPSCs to cerebral cortex was carried out as described, with minor modifications (<Shi et al., 2012a>, <Shi et al., 2012b>). For drug treatment, all compounds were dissolved in DMSO at the concentrations noted, and DMSO was the vehicle control in all experiments. Compounds were added 30 min prior to incubation with recombinant tau protein (dynamin inhibitor Dynasore [Abcam] and actin polymerization inhibitor Cytochalasin D [Tocris Bioscience]). To establish identity and quality of neuronal induction, gene expression profiling was performed on a custom gene expression panel. RNA was isolated from iPSC cortical inductions, 35 days after induction, using an RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression of genes in neurons (MAP2, MAPT, and NGN2), cerebral cortex progenitor cells (EMX2, PAX6, and FOXG1), ventral telencephalon (NKX2-1 and LHX8), and mid-/hindbrain (HOXA and HOXB) was assessed in all neuronal inductions on the Nanostring nCounter platform. Cytotoxicity/cytolysis were assessed by analyzing the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (Roche) in conditioned media samples following treatments. Tau P301S_10×his-tag_avi-tag was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria. Cells were lysed using BugBuster (Millipore), and clarified lysate was applied to a 5-mL HisTrapHP column (GE Healthcare) in 2× PBS. Tau was eluted using a 0- to 500-mM imidazole gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and further purified in 2× PBS using a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Pooled fractions were then concentrated to approximately 8 mg/mL using a spin concentrator (Millipore). Final protein concentration was determined by Nanodrop analysis. 1 mL tau P301S at 8 mg/mL was incubated with 4 mg.mL−1 heparin (Sigma) in PBS plus 30 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH 7.2) at 37°C for 72 hr. Aggregated material was diluted in 9 mL PBS plus 1% (v/v) sarkosyl (Sigma) and left rocking for 1 hr at room temperature to completely solubilize any non-aggregated material. Insoluble tau was pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 1 hr at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS by vigorous pipetting and sonicated at 100 W for 3 × 20 s (Hielscher UP200St ultrasonicator) to disperse clumps of protein and break large filaments into smaller species. Whole-cell protein extraction was performed by lysis of cell pellets in cell extraction buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with PMSF (Sigma), protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific), and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific) before collection of the soluble fraction by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Soluble fractions were diluted in PBS and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads (Sigma) overnight; magnetic beads with bound proteins were washed following the manufacturer’s instructions and resuspended in lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) PAGE loading buffer. Western blot analysis was carried out using total tau antibody (Dako). Detection of immunoblot was carried out using LI-COR Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System and Image Studio Software. To label purified recombinant tau with Dylight 488 NHS ester (Thermo Fisher Scientific), monomeric or aggregated tau P301S (concentration of 8 and 2 mg.mL−1, respectively) was dialysed into PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer mini dialysis units (Thermo Fisher Scientific) overnight at 4°C. The dialysed tau preparation was then conjugated to 50 μg Dylight according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Non-incorporated dye was removed by overnight dialysis against 2× 1 L PBS at 4°C and the concentration determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).To label purified recombinant tau with a pH-sensitive form of rhodamine (pHrodo, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 150 μM tau protein (or equivalent protein concentration for aggregate; ∼7 μg.mL−1) was incubated with 1.5 mM pHrodo Red Maleimide (dissolved in DMSO) and 1.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (TCEP) (1:10:10 molar ratio, respectively) for 2 hr in the dark at room temperature (RT). After incubation, labeled protein samples were subjected to size exclusion chromatography at 4°C (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in 50 mM phosphate (pH 7."
PMC5896171_6,"4) and 150 mM NaCl to remove unreacted dye and assess perturbation of oligomeric state by labeling (no change was observed, data not shown)  10 mM 10-kDa dextran conjugated to pHrodo (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was dissolved in DMSO. 5 mg. mL−1 transferrin conjugated to pHrodo (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was dissolved in PBS. Gel filtration chromatography used Superdex 200 increase 10/300 (GE Healthcare). Protein samples (0.1–5 mg.mL−1, 1% bed volume) were resolved at a flow rate of 0.5 mL.min−1; absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. Void volume and specific molecular weights of globular calibration proteins were determined using gel filtration low- and high-molecular weight calibration kits (GE Healthcare). Formation of tau fibrils was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, largely as described (<Goedert et al., 1992>). Briefly, samples were mounted on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate, and negatively stained tau fibrils were imaged as described (<Goedert et al., 1992>). Tau P301S labeled with either Dylight or pHrodo was diluted in neuronal maintenance tissue culture medium and added to neurons at the concentration and for the time indicated. Neurons were washed three times using 1× Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) before fixation and processing for immunofluorescence and processing for flow cytometry or subjected to live imaging. Immunohistochemistry was performed on neurons as previously described (<Shi et al., 2012a>) using the following primary antibodies: MAP2 from Abcam (ab5392), and EEA1 and LAMP1 from Cell Signaling Technology (C45B10 and D2D11). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-mouse Alexa594 (A21125), goat anti-chicken Alexa 647 (A21449), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 546 (A11010), donkey anti-mouse Alexa 594 (A21203), and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (A21207, all from Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired using an Olympus FV1000 or Opera Phenix imaging systems. Typically conditions were repeated in triplicate and >12 images were collected per well. Quantification of fixed-cell imaging was performed using CellProfiler, using an automated pipeline. The pipeline first detected nuclei using the DAPI channel, their number, and the area was quantified. Next, the pipeline applied a fixed-intensity threshold that was applied to every image in the 488/tau channel to exclude low-level detector noise, followed by 488 positive tau object detection as primary objects and measuring of number and area. In co-labeling experiments, endosomes labeled with EEA1 or LAMP1 in the 546 channel were analyzed as described above for the tau channel. Next, a mask was created using the 546 channel. Application of this mask to the 488 channel allowed measuring of the number and area of tau objects covered by the mask, i.e., the number of tau-positive vesicles (objects) that overlap with endosomal markers EEA1 or LAMP1. To correct this measure for possible variations in cell density in the image, it was normalized to the number of nuclei. After three 1× HBSS washes, neurons were dissociated using Accutase (Sigma, A6964) into single cells. Dissociated cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation (1,000 × g for 1 min), the supernatant was removed, and cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, nuclei counterstained with DAPI, and analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa. Cells were gated using forward and side scatter channels to remove debris and gated using the side scatter channel to remove doublets. Fluorescence in the DAPI and 466 channels of this population was analyzed. Tau-negative neurons were defined using neurons that had not been treated with tau (indicated in black in <Figure 1>B) and tau-positive neurons (indicated in green). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using Flowing software. Neurons grown on μ-Plate 96 well (Ibidi) were imaged for fluorescent pHrodo-labeled protein (excitation at 561 nm and emission at 570–630 nm) in an acidic environment using a 40× confocal Opera Phenix high-content screening system (PerkinElmer). Bright-field and fluorescence emission images were collected at 10-min intervals. Parameters for fluorescent objects were set (fluorescent intensity and contrast) and quantified using the Harmony software (PerkinElmer). Data were analyzed using Prism Software (GraphPad). Typically, conditions were repeated at least in triplicate and <4 (typically 8) fields were recorded per well. To track individual objects, images were collected at 1-s intervals. Images were analyzed in Harmony 4.5 (PerkinElmer). Densely clumped areas of wells were excluded, and a spot-finding algorithm was used to detect foci of pHrodo-labeled protein. Within the spots, fluorescent intensity of the Alexa-568 channel was quantified representing the amount of labeled protein taken up into the endosomes. A high-intensity threshold was used with the spot-finding algorithm to detect only the very bright spots within the wells; discrete spots were counted to determine the number of pHrodo-positive vesicles within the cells. The number of replica wells and experiments are indicated in the figure legends for each assay where appropriate. For live-cell imaging assays using pHrodo-labeled protein, intensity and number of objects were assessed as described in <Live Imaging and Data Analysis>. Typically, 8 fields were recorded per well and an average generated from the Harmony 4.5 software (PerkinElmer). Analyses were performed using the Prism version 7.0b software (GraphPad). One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple testing or Student’s t test was used where appropriate. In Alzheimer’s disease, neurofibrillary tangle pathology appears to spread along neuronal connections, proposed to be mediated by the release and uptake of abnormal, disease-specific forms of microtubule-binding protein tau MAPT. It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two entry mechanisms for monomeric tau to human neurons: a rapid dynamin-dependent phase typical of endocytosis and a second, slower actin-dependent phase of macropinocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerization and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate monomeric tau entry into neurons, but less efficiently in the case of aggregated tau, where internalized tau carries antibody with it into neurons. These data suggest that tau entry to human neurons is a physiological process and not a disease-specific phenomenon. rhetorical Extracellular tau protein enters human neurons by endocytosis and micropinocytosis Aggregated tau enters human neurons primarily by endocytosis Tau antibodies reduce uptake and are carried into neurons by tau Findings suggest that tau uptake is dependent on carrier proteins or receptors In contrast with predictions that transfer of the microtubule-associated protein tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia, Evans et al. show that healthy human neurons efficiently take up both normal and aggregated tau, by distinct but overlapping uptake mechanisms. ."
PMC6039173_0,"Tauopathies feature progressive accumulation of tau amyloids. Pathology may begin when these amplify from a protein template, or seed, whose structure is unknown. We have purified and characterized distinct forms of tau monomer—inert (Mi) and seed-competent (Ms). Recombinant Ms triggered intracellular tau aggregation, induced tau fibrillization in vitro, and self-assembled. Ms from Alzheimer’s disease also seeded aggregation and self-assembled in vitro to form seed-competent multimers. We used crosslinking with mass spectrometry to probe structural differences in Mi vs. Ms. Crosslinks informed models of local peptide structure within the repeat domain which suggest relative inaccessibility of residues that drive aggregation (VQIINK/VQIVYK) in Mi, and exposure in Ms. Limited proteolysis supported this idea. Although tau monomer has been considered to be natively unstructured, our findings belie this assumption and suggest that initiation of pathological aggregation could begin with conversion of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form. When doctors perform autopsies to look at the brain tissue of people with Alzheimer’s disease, they find toxic buildups of certain proteins – in particular, a protein called tau – in structures called ‘aggregates’. People with more severe dementia have more tau aggregates in their brain. Aggregates form when individual proteins stick together in repetitive patterns, much like the way a single Lego block might attach to another identical one. Like all proteins, tau is built from a string of amino acids that folds into a specific shape. Normally folded tau proteins do not form aggregates. It was not clear that an individual tau protein had two distinct forms—structures associated with health (“good”) or disease (“bad”).Mirbaha et al. have now studied the folding pattern of purified tau proteins with a sophisticated technology called mass spectrometry. This technique can measure changes in tiny amounts of protein. Some of the purified proteins had been extracted from human brains (from people with and without Alzheimer’s). To detect which of the proteins were toxic, Mirbaha et al. also grew simple human cells in a dish that were designed to react specifically to the bad forms of tau. This allowed the good and bad forms of tau to be isolated.Mirbaha et al. discovered that in the good form of tau the parts of the protein that allow it to stick to itself are hidden, folded inside. By contrast, the bad form of tau exposes the parts that allow it to aggregate, enabling the protein to build upon itself to form a large, toxic assembly.The shape-shifting concept established by Mirbaha et al. might apply to other proteins that form toxic aggregates. This could help us to better understand how many other neurodegenerative diseases develop and progress. Recognizing that the shapes that tau forms can be categorized as either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ may also help to develop new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Drugs could be designed to stabilize the good form of tau, or to help remove the bad form from the brain. Furthermore, if the shape-shift described by Mirbaha et al. can be measured early enough in patients, it may allow treatments for Alzheimer’s before people have developed any detectable symptoms.

We thank Hilal Lashuel, Ph.D. for critical comments on the manuscript. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files. Amyloids are ordered protein assemblies, typically rich in beta sheet, that underlie multiple disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-forming proteins include tau, synuclein, and expanded polyglutamine proteins such as huntingtin, among many others. It is unknown how or why intracellular proteins such as tau transition from a relatively inert form to one that efficiently self-assembles into ordered structures in vivo. This process begins with the formation of a pathogenic ‘seed,’ a structure that serves as a template for homotypic fibril growth. This structural transition could be a critical event in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Under defined conditions and relatively high concentrations (typically micromolar), recombinant tau monomer will form amyloid fibrils in vitro. However the basis of spontaneous assembly in cells is unknown. The conversion of a protein from a monomer to a large, ordered multimer could occur by several mechanisms, but the first step probably involves the formation of a seed. This event, and indeed the actual conformation or assembly state of the protein that constitutes the ‘minimal’ seed, has remained obscure. This has led to the idea that a seed is potentially transitory, arising from an equilibrium between two states: one relatively aggregation-resistant, and another that is short-lived. A seed could be a single molecule, or several. Based on extrapolation from kinetic aggregation studies, it has been suggested that a critical seed for tau and polyglutamine peptide amyloid formation is a single molecule (<Chirita et al., 2005>; <Bhattacharyya et al., 2005>; <Kar et al., 2011>), while an earlier study (among others [<Ramachandran and Udgaonkar, 2013>]) has proposed a tau multimer (<Friedhoff et al., 1998>). Isolation of the seed-competent form of tau could be critical to understanding the initiation of disease and the design of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics.Tau forms amyloids that underlie neurodegeneration in a variety of neuropathological syndromes, collectively termed tauopathies (<Lee et al., 2001>). These include AD and frontotemporal dementias, among many others. Multiple groups, including ours, have now observed that tau will propagate an aggregated state from the outside to the inside of a cell, between cells, across synapses, and within brain networks (<Sanders et al., 2016>). In prior work, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to define tau trimers as the minimal unit of spontaneous cellular uptake and intracellular amyloid formation, and proposed this as the smallest particle capable of propagating aggregates between cells (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). This work involved application of ‘naked’ protein assemblies derived from recombinant protein or human brain onto cultured ‘biosensor’ HEK293 cells or primary neurons that express a tau aggregation reporter (<Frost et al., 2009a>; <Holmes et al., 2014>). Biosensor cells and primary neurons alike take up tau aggregates via macropinocytosis (<Holmes et al., 2013>). The aggregates subsequently serve as highly specific templates to trigger intracellular amyloid formation (<Holmes et al., 2014>; <Sanders et al., 2014>). We have also determined that preincubation of cationic lipids such as lipofectamine with tau seeds facilitates their direct transduction into a cell, bypassing the physiologic uptake mechanism (<Holmes et al., 2014>; <Furman et al., 2015>). Lipofectamine-mediated delivery into biosensor cells allows direct quantitation of seed titer for both tau and α-synuclein (<Holmes et al., 2013>).Tau is intrinsically disordered upon isolation from bacteria or mammalian cells and is relatively inert in terms of spontaneous self-assembly. However under various conditions, including exposure to polyanions such as heparin, tau will form aggregates via nucleated self-assembly (<Goedert et al., 1996>; <Pérez et al., 1996>). It is unknown how these experimental conditions relate to the initiation of aggregation in human brain."
PMC6039173_1,"We have now purified various stable forms of full-length tau monomer from recombinant sources and human brain  One is relatively inert and is stable for long periods. Another is ‘seed-competent,’ triggers amyloid formation in cells and in vitro, and exhibits intrinsic properties of self-assembly. We have used crosslinking with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to probe the structures of these molecules. Models of discrete regions within the RD predict that differential exposure of hexapeptide motifs previously known to be important for amyloid formation distinguishes the two forms of tau. These models are supported by limited proteolysis studies. The identification of distinct and stable forms of tau monomer, including some that are uniquely seed-competent, bears directly on how we understand the initiation of protein aggregation in the tauopathies. We initially sought to define the tau seeding unit that would trigger intracellular aggregation upon direct delivery to the cell interior. We had previously observed that a tau trimer is the minimal assembly size that triggers endocytosis and intracellular seeding (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). These experiments depended on spontaneous cell uptake, since no lipofectamine was added to the reactions. A prior study had also indicated the role of disulfide linkages in promoting tau aggregation, potentially by dimer formation (<Friedhoff et al., 1998>). Thus, for our initial studies we engineered and purified full-length (FL) tau monomer that lacks any internal cysteines due to alanine substitutions (C299A and C322A), termed tau (2A). FL tau (2A) cannot self-associate based on disulfide linkages, which helped prevent the formation of cryptic dimers that could have confounded our studies. These substitutions did not affect tau purification, heparin-induced fibrillization, and sonication protocols, which we performed as described previously (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). We treated fibril preps with sonication, prior to isolation of recombinant FL tau (2A) assemblies of various sizes by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). In parallel, we also studied FL wild type (WT) tau. We purified unfibrillized recombinant FL tau (2A) monomer by SEC (<Figure 1A>), and isolated SEC fractions of sonicated fibrils that contained putative monomer, dimer, trimer and ~10 mer (<Figure 1B>). rhetorical Figure 1. (A, B) FL Cys-Tau(2A) was labeled with Alexa488 and resolved by SEC (A), or was fibrillized in the presence of heparin, labeled with Alexa488, sonicated, and the assemblies resolved by SEC (B). The column was calibrated using standards of the indicated hydrodynamic radii. Color codes indicate the putative assembly units. (C) Tau assemblies were seeded into tau RD-CFP/YFP biosensor cells. Mi represents ‘inert’ monomer purified in (A), which had no seeding activity; Ms represents ‘seed-competent’ monomer purified in (B), which induced intracellular tau aggregation (p<0.001). (D) FL WT tau and FL Cys-Tau(2A) were similarly fibrillized, sonicated, and the fragments resolved by SEC. Seeding activity of each fraction was determined. Ms and larger assemblies of both forms of tau exhibited seeding activity, but not Mi. IFD = Integrated FRET Density. (E) Tau assemblies of n = 1,2,3 were passed through a 100kD size cutoff filter. Filtration had no effect on the Ms fraction, whereas it reduced seeding of assemblies of n = 2 or 3. (F) Tau fibrils, trimer, or monomer were used to induce fibrillization in vitro of full-length (0N4R) tau, measured by induced thioflavin fluorescence. Mi had no seeding activity, whereas Ms, trimer, and unfractionated fibrils had strong seeding activity. (G,H) Titration of assemblies was performed. (G) Ms exhibited an EC50 of approximately 10 nM (monomer equivalent); (H) Dimer and trimer had similar potencies. Concentration is reflected as monomer equivalent. See <Figure 1—source data 1>. We initially sought to define the tau seeding unit that would trigger intracellular aggregation upon direct delivery to the cell interior. We had previously observed that a tau trimer is the minimal assembly size that triggers endocytosis and intracellular seeding (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). These experiments depended on spontaneous cell uptake, since no lipofectamine was added to the reactions. A prior study had also indicated the role of disulfide linkages in promoting tau aggregation, potentially by dimer formation (<Friedhoff et al., 1998>). Thus, for our initial studies we engineered and purified full-length (FL) tau monomer that lacks any internal cysteines due to alanine substitutions (C299A and C322A), termed tau (2A). FL tau (2A) cannot self-associate based on disulfide linkages, which helped prevent the formation of cryptic dimers that could have confounded our studies. These substitutions did not affect tau purification, heparin-induced fibrillization, and sonication protocols, which we performed as described previously (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). We treated fibril preps with sonication, prior to isolation of recombinant FL tau (2A) assemblies of various sizes by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>). In parallel, we also studied FL wild type (WT) tau. We purified unfibrillized recombinant FL tau (2A) monomer by SEC (<Figure 1A>), and isolated SEC fractions of sonicated fibrils that contained putative monomer, dimer, trimer and ~10 mer (<Figure 1B>). To test the seeding activity of the tau preparations, we used a previously described ‘biosensor’ cell reporter line (<Holmes et al., 2014>). These cells stably express 4R tau repeat domain (RD) containing the disease-associated P301S mutation. All cells express 4R-RD-Cyan fluorescent protein and 4R-RD-yellow fluorescent protein (RD-CFP/YFP). Exogenously applied seeds induce intracellular aggregation with resultant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CFP and YFP that can be measured via flow cytometry (<Holmes et al., 2014>; <Furman et al., 2015>). The degree of aggregation is scored using ‘integrated FRET density’ (IFD), which is the product of the percent positive cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of FRET-positive cells, and from this we determine a titer of tau seeding activity (<Holmes et al., 2014>). Lipofectamine directly transduces tau assemblies across the plasma membrane and increases the assay’s sensitivity by approximately 100-fold. Upon incubation with Lipofectamine, we were surprised to observe seeding by monomer and larger assemblies alike, whether FL WT or 2A. (<Figure 1C,D>). Epifluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of intracellular inclusions after FL WT tau monomer seeding (<Figure 1D>). We termed the inert monomer ‘Mi,’ and the seed-competent monomer ‘Ms.’ To rule out higher order assemblies of tau within the putative monomer fraction, immediately prior to the seeding assay we passed fractions through a 100 kDa cutoff filter to eliminate anything larger than a monomer. While monomer fraction retained ~80% of seeding activity, only ~20% of dimer seeding activity remained, and ~1–2% of trimer seeding activity remained (<Figure 1E>). To exclude an artifact related to Lipofectamine transduction into cells, we tested FL (2A) tau preparations in an in vitro seeding assay that induces fibril formation by full-length tau (0N4R) through iterative polymerization and agitation steps (<Morozova et al., 2013>). Mi had no intrinsic seeding activity. However Ms induced amyloid formation, albeit more slowly than trimer or unfractionated fibrils (<Figure 1F>). This slow aggregation process may reflect inefficient fibril assembly, and a predominance of small nucleated assembly events from the added monomer. We concluded that the Ms fraction contained seeding activity that enabled intracellular aggregation of tau RD-CFP/YFP in cells, or full-length tau in vitro. Finally, we tested whether contamination of very small amounts of seeds could somehow account for the seeding activity in monomer fractions by carrying out dose-response titrations of the various preparations. Ms had an EC50 of ~10 nM (<Figure 1G>), which was very similar to dimer and trimer (<Figure 1H>)."
PMC6039173_2,"Thus to account for signal observed in the seeding assay, contamination of an otherwise inert monomer with larger seed-competent assemblies would have to be substantial  We tested for obvious structural differences between Mi and Ms using CD spectroscopy, which revealed none (<Figure 2A>). We re-tested the assemblies using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which measures particle diffusion through a fixed volume. As we previously observed (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>), we accurately estimated the units of small assemblies (≤10 mer), but not larger assemblies (>10 mer) (<Figure 2B>). In an additional effort to detect cryptic multimers within the Ms preparation, we used double-label FCS. We engineered a cysteine onto the amino terminus of FL tau (2A) to enable its covalent modification (Cys-Tau (2A)). We then prepared Cys-tau (2A) fibrils, or monomer, and labeled them simultaneously with Alexa488 (green) and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) via maleimide chemistry. We carried out sonication and purification by SEC as before, isolating assemblies of various sizes. We evaluated each for cross-correlation between red and green signal, which indicates the presence of at least two tau molecules in a particle. We analyzed >300 events for each assembly. When we evaluated Mi and Ms, 100% of events in each case showed a diffusion time consistent with a tau monomer (<Figure 2C,D>). Furthermore, we observed no cross-correlation between red and green signal, indicating that neither preparation had detectable multimeric assemblies (<Figure 2C,D,H>). By contrast, when we evaluated larger species such as dimer, trimer, or ~10 mer, we observed longer diffusion times consistent with the predicted assembly sizes, and significant cross-correlation values (<Figure 2E–H>), consistent with the presence of multimers. The FCS studies supported the conclusion that Mi and Ms are comprised predominantly of monomer. rhetorical Figure 2. (A) CD spectra of Mi and Ms were similar. (B) FCS Diffusion times for Mi, MS, dimer, trimer, and ~10 mer, and the cross-correlation for Mi, Ms, dimer, trimer, and ≥10 mer were determined after labeling of fibrils with Alexa488, or double labeling additionally with tetramethylrhodamine prior to sonication.

Cross correlation (CC) between the two dyes is indicated in grey lines. (H) Summary of FCS cross-correlation, including free dyes. Neither free dye, Mi nor Ms showed any cross-correlation, indicating that single species predominate. All multimeric assemblies exhibited cross-correlation, indicating detection of both dyes within a single particle. See <Figure 2—source data 1>. We tested for obvious structural differences between Mi and Ms using CD spectroscopy, which revealed none (<Figure 2A>). We re-tested the assemblies using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which measures particle diffusion through a fixed volume.

The FCS studies supported the conclusion that Mi and Ms are comprised predominantly of monomer. To rule out cross-contamination of assemblies within the SEC column, we tested its ability to exclude larger seeds from the monomer fraction. We first isolated Ms and larger assemblies from a sonicated fibril preparation (<Figure 3>, Group 1). Removing the fraction that contained Ms (B5), we then pooled the remaining fractions, and spiked them with Mi. We re-fractionated the material on SEC to isolate the monomer in fraction B5 again (<Figure 3>, Group 2). As previously observed, Ms and other fibril-derived assemblies in Group 1 had seeding activity (<Figure 3>). However, in Group 2, while we observed seeding activity in larger assemblies, the monomer (which we take to be Mi) re-isolated from a pool of larger fibril-derived assemblies had no seeding activity (<Figure 3>). This confirmed that larger, seed-competent assemblies do not appreciably contaminate the monomer fraction during SEC. rhetorical Figure 3. SEC fidelity was tested by isolating Ms from fractions after fibril sonication. Remaining fractions were combined with Mi, and the mix was re-isolated by SEC. In Group 1, after the first isolation, the monomer fraction (which contains Ms) contained seeding activity. In Group 2, after the second purification by SEC, the monomer fraction (which contains Mi spiked in) did not exhibit seeding activity. See <Figure 3—source data 1>. To rule out cross-contamination of assemblies within the SEC column, we tested its ability to exclude larger seeds from the monomer fraction. We first isolated Ms and larger assemblies from a sonicated fibril preparation (<Figure 3>, Group 1).

This confirmed that larger, seed-competent assemblies do not appreciably contaminate the monomer fraction during SEC. Although prior controls had essentially excluded the presence of tau multimers in the sample, we used heat-mediated dissociation of oligomeric assemblies as an additional test for the possibility that Ms in fact represents a uniquely compact multimer that somehow purifies as a monomer. We collected Ms by SEC, and heated the sample to 95°C for 3 hr. We then re-isolated the sample via SEC. We carried out the same procedure with trimer and ~20 mer. In each case, we tested the resultant fractions for seeding activity. In the first instance, after heating we re-isolated Ms purely as monomer that retained virtually all of its seeding activity (<Figure 4A>). The trimer assembly (fraction B8) broke down to smaller assemblies, predominantly monomer, each of which retained seeding activity (<Figure 4B>). The ~20 mer (fraction A5) was largely stable following heat treatment, and retained its seeding activity (<Figure 4C>). These experiments highlighted the lability of small multimers (i.e. trimer), and a surprising persistence of seeding activity in heat-treated monomer. rhetorical Figure 4. (A–C) Heat-induced dissociation of assemblies. (A) The SEC fraction containing Ms (B5) was heated to 95°C for 3 hr and re-isolated by SEC prior to testing the FRET biosensor assay. No loss in seeding activity was observed."
PMC6039173_3,"(B) When the SEC fraction containing trimer (B8) was heated similarly, seeding activity shifted to fractions that contain dimer and monomer (B7, B5)  (C) ~ 20 mer (A5) was largely stable to heating, although some smaller seed-competent assemblies were liberated. (D–G) Various assemblies were subjected to heat denaturation at the indicated temperatures and times, followed by analysis of seeding activity in the FRET biosensor assay. Whereas ~10 mer and ~20 mer were relatively stable from 65–95°C, monomer, dimer and trimer showed temperature-dependent loss of seeding activity. (H) Plot of denaturation data for Ms with multimodal regression curves superimposed. See <Figure 4—source data 1>. Although prior controls had essentially excluded the presence of tau multimers in the sample, we used heat-mediated dissociation of oligomeric assemblies as an additional test for the possibility that Ms in fact represents a uniquely compact multimer that somehow purifies as a monomer.

The ~20 mer (fraction A5) was largely stable following heat treatment, and retained its seeding activity (<Figure 4C>). These experiments highlighted the lability of small multimers (i.e. trimer), and a surprising persistence of seeding activity in heat-treated monomer. In the preceding experiment Ms retained seeding activity even after 3 hr at 95°C, a condition sufficient to dissociate trimers. These experiments implied that Ms consists of a stable seed-competent structure, resistant to heat denaturation. Consequently, we used more nuanced heat denaturation of seeding activity to probe the relative stabilities of Ms, dimer, trimer, and larger assemblies of FL WT tau. We first isolated tau monomer, dimer, trimer,~10 mer, and ~20 mer on SEC. We then incubated the various assemblies at a range of temperatures (65, 75, 85, 95°C) and times (0, 3, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72 hr) before measuring seeding activity. Lower temperatures only slightly reduced seeding activity, whereas exposure of Ms, dimer, and trimer to temperatures ≥ 85°C for 18–24 hr eliminated it at roughly the same rate for each (<Figure 4D–G>). By contrast, the seeding activities of ~10 mer and ~20 mer were relatively heat-resistant (<Figure 4D–G>). This was consistent with our prior observations that tau seeds derived from cultured cells are resistant to boiling (<Sanders et al., 2014>). To determine a putative energy barrier between Ms and Mi, we evaluated the denaturation data for Ms by integrating the data from the prior experiments (<Figure 4H>). We compared two models for the transition of Ms to an inert form (which we assumed to be an unfolding reaction): a unimodal unfolding model vs. a multimodal model that assumes intermediate seed-competent states. The unimodal model did not account for the data at early time points, which indicated a lag phase in denaturation, whereas the multimodel model performed better (<Figure 4H>). The lag phase in denaturation implied an ensemble of seed-competent states that define Ms, each separated by smaller energy barriers. Using the multimodal model, we calculated the barrier to conversion of Ms to an inert form to be ~78 kcal/mol. Aggregation of Mi in vitro is relatively slow, requires high protein concentration (micromolar), and polyanions such as heparin (<Goedert et al., 1996>; <Pérez et al., 1996>). Based on the seeding activity of Ms, we predicted that it might more readily self-associate. We incubated FL WT tau Mi and Ms alone, or dimer or trimer at equimolar ratios, keeping total particle concentration constant at 500 nM. We then monitored change in assembly size over 24 hr. Mi, dimer, and trimer showed no evidence of self-association in this timeframe (<Figure 5A,C,D>). By contrast, when incubated alone, Ms readily formed larger assemblies (<Figure 5B>). When we incubated Mi with dimer or trimer, we saw no change in the assembly population over 24 hr (<Figure 5E,F>). By contrast, when we mixed Ms with dimer or trimer we observed a growth of larger assemblies with a concomitant reduction in dimer and trimer peaks (<Figure 5G,H>). We conclude that Mi, dimer, and trimer do not form larger assemblies at an appreciable rate, while Ms self-assembles and adds on to larger assemblies. rhetorical Figure 5. Mi and Ms were incubated at 500 nM or with equivalent amounts (monomer equivalent) of dimer and trimer for various times prior to resolution by SEC. Assemblies were monitored by reading the absorbance of fractions using micro BCA assay. (A) Mi showed no self-association. (B) Ms exhibited self-association over time. (C,D) Dimer and trimer were stable over time. (E,F) Mi does not react with dimer or trimer to form larger assemblies. (G,H) Ms reacts with dimer and trimer to form larger assemblies. See <Figure 5—source data 1>. Aggregation of Mi in vitro is relatively slow, requires high protein concentration (micromolar), and polyanions such as heparin (<Goedert et al., 1996>; <Pérez et al., 1996>).

We conclude that Mi, dimer, and trimer do not form larger assemblies at an appreciable rate, while Ms self-assembles and adds on to larger assemblies. The preparation of Ms based on sonication of fibrils raised two important issues. First, it left uncertain whether Mi could be converted to a seed-competent form without previously being incorporated into a fibril. Second, we observed that sonication could create fragments from tau monomer that might potentially act as seeds (<Figure 6—figure supplement 1>). Consequently, we used heparin to induce the formation of Ms, thereby avoiding sonication. We exposed FL WT tau to heparin for varying amounts of time before purifying different assembly sizes by SEC and testing for seeding activity. After 15 min of heparin exposure, we detected low but significant amounts of seed-competent monomer, and much fewer larger assemblies (<Figure 6A>). Crosslinking of purified, heparin-induced Ms revealed no evidence of multimers or an increase in fragments (<Figure 6—figure supplement 1>). Recombinant monomer not treated with heparin had no seeding activity at any time point (<Figure 6A>). At longer heparin treatment times (1 hr, 4 hr) monomer fractions as well as larger assemblies all had strong seeding activity (<Figure 6A>). Ms derived from heparin exposure was relatively resistant to heat denaturation at 95°C, albeit less so than fibril-derived Ms (<Figure 6B>). Relative seeding efficiency of the various forms of Ms as well as sonicated or unsonicated fibrils were relatively similar (<Figure 6C>). We noted also that sonication of Mi and purification by SEC did not produce any seed-competent species, eliminating the possibility that small assemblies of sonication-induced fragments accounted for seeding activity of Ms (<Figure 6C>). These experiments also indicated that it is not necessary for tau monomer to be part of a fibril or to be exposed to sonication to produce an efficient seed-competent monomer."

Mi exhibited crosslink patterns which indicated local and distant intramolecular contacts (<Figure 7A>). In Ms, we observed a consistent crosslinking of K150 with K254, K267, K274 or K280 all located between RD 1 and 2. These crosslinks tracked exclusively with Ms, both fibril- or heparin-derived (<Figure 7B,C>). We never observed these crosslinks in Mi. To test the relationship of this crosslink with seed function, we carried out heat denaturation at 95°C for 3 or 24 hr, followed by XL-MS. Heating samples results in a decrease in crosslink frequency (<Figure 7—figure supplement 1>). Importantly, however, we observed a parallel persistence of this crosslink pattern with seeding activity (<Figure 7B,C>). The XL-MS results indicate a distinct structure and seeding activity for Ms that is surprisingly resistant to denaturation at 95°C. Given our experiments with recombinant Mi and Ms, we wished to test whether similar structures exist in vivo. We extracted AD and control brain samples using a dounce homogenizer to avoid liberating significant monomer from fibrils. We immunoprecipitated tau using an antibody that targets the amino-terminus (HJ8.5), and resolved the eluates by SEC, followed by ELISA to determine tau levels (<Figure 8A,B>). Tau from control brain purified in the monomer fraction (<Figure 8A>), while tau from AD brain distributed across multiple fractions, corresponding to monomer and larger assemblies (<Figure 8B>). When we tested each fraction for seeding activity, we observed none in any control brain fraction (<Figure 8C>). However, all AD fractions contained seeding activity, including monomer (<Figure 8C>). To exclude the possibility that the brain homogenization protocol liberated Ms from neurofibrillary tangles, we spiked tau KO mouse brain samples with recombinant fibrils in vitro, or fibril-derived Ms. We then used dounce homogenization and immuno-purification as for human brain. We evaluated the seeding activity in total lysate, supernatant following 10,000 x g centrifugation, and SEC fractions (<Figure 8D>). We readily observed monomer seeding activity in tau KO brain spiked with Ms, however we observed none in fractions that had been spiked with fibrils (<Figure 8D>). The homogenization protocol for human brain was thus unlikely to have liberated Ms from pre-existing tau fibrils. rhetorical Figure 8.

The homogenization protocol for human brain was thus unlikely to have liberated Ms from pre-existing tau fibrils.To test for self-association of control-derived Mi vs. AD-derived Ms, we purified these species by SEC, and divided each monomer fraction in two. We snap-froze one fraction and incubated the other overnight at room temperature. Then, we again resolved the assemblies via SEC and tested each fraction for seeding activity. Control monomer was inert, even after incubation at RT (<Figure 8E>). AD-derived Ms that was purified, frozen, and re-purified by SEC exhibited seeding activity exclusively in the monomer fraction (<Figure 8E>). By contrast, AD-derived Ms incubated at RT formed seed-competent assemblies of increasing size (<Figure 8E>). We concluded that, as for other types of Ms, AD-derived Ms exhibited an intrinsic capacity for self-association into seed-competent assemblies. To compare structures of control vs. AD-derived monomer via XL-MS, we isolated tau from brains of 3 AD patients and three age-matched controls. In control-derived monomer, we observed no evidence of the crosslink that marked Ms (<Figure 8G>). However, in each AD-derived Ms sample we observed a discrete set of crosslinks between aa150 and aa259-290 (<Figure 8H>). This essential finding did not change, no matter what method of homogenization we used (<Figure 8—figure supplement 1>), and implied a common structure that unifies ensembles of seed-competent tau monomer, whether produced in vitro or in vivo. Based on intramolecular FRET and electron paramagnetic resonance spin labeling Mandelkow et al. have previously proposed native tau structure to be in a ‘paperclip’ configuration, with the C-terminus folded over the RD (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>). To understand how core elements of tau control its aggregation, we employed Rosetta to create models of tau structure for Mi and Ms using restraints from the crosslink patterns and length of the DSS crosslinker. The overall energetics and radii of gyration in the models were comparable for Mi and Ms (<Figure 9—figure supplement 1>), indicating global structural similarity. We thus focused on the RD, given its high frequency of intramolecular crosslinks, and primary role in aggregation (<Figure 9A>). We observed differences in the predicted interface structure between R1/R2 and R2/R3 which encode two core VQIINK and VQIVYK motifs critical for tau amyloid formation (<von Bergen et al., 2000>; <von Bergen et al., 2001>).

The cleavage patterns were thus consistent with structural models of VQIINK and VQIVYK regions, which predicted relative inaccessibility of hairpin-associated sequences in Mi, and accessibility in Ms. We propose that tau monomer occupies two distinct and stable conformational ensembles. One set of structures (collectively termed Mi) is relatively inert, while another has intrinsic ability to self-assemble, and acts as a template, or seed, for fibril growth in vitro and in cells (collectively termed Ms). Multiple controls indicated that our original preparation of fibril-derived Ms is in fact a monomer, uncontaminated by larger assemblies. Tau monomer purified from AD brain also had intrinsic seeding activity, and self-associated to produce larger seed-competent assemblies. A model restrained by the XL-MS data, and consistent with biochemical studies, predicts that VQIVYK and VQIINK sequences assume an open configuration in all types of Ms (fibril-derived, heparin-induced, and AD-derived). By contrast, the model predicts lack of VQIINK/VQIVYK exposure in Mi. Limited proteolysis studies are consistent with this idea, although clearly more detailed biochemical, biophysical, and structural analyses will be needed to test its validity. Taken together, these data establish a new concept for tau: this intrinsically disordered protein has multiple, stable monomeric states, functionally distinguished by the presence or absence of seeding activity.Amyloid proteins form progressively larger assemblies over time, and it has been difficult to define the composition of the minimal seed. Mandelkow and colleagues studied tau aggregation in vitro and concluded that a seed of 8–12 molecules existed in their experimental system (<Friedhoff et al., 1998>). By contrast, Kuret and colleagues posited an ‘intermediate’ of tau that could subsequently initiate self-assembly, and their data, based on extrapolation of tau concentrations needed to enable development of thioflavin fluorescence in vitro, were consistent with a monomeric seed (<Chirita et al., 2005>). Wetzel and colleagues also proposed that a monomer is the basis of a ‘thermodynamic nucleus’ that templates the aggregation of synthetic polyglutamine peptides (<Bhattacharyya et al., 2005>). However, no prior study has previously identified stable forms of tau monomer that seed amyloid formation.The actual cause of tau aggregation in tauopathies is unknown. It has been proposed that dissociation of tau monomer from microtubules, possibly due to phosphorylation, allows high concentration and self-association to form pathogenic assemblies (<Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012>). In this study, using a single source of recombinant protein, we define distinctly structured seed-competent and inert forms of tau. We have similarly identified seed-competent species in human brain. In reality ‘seed-competent’ and ‘inert’ forms of tau almost certainly represent multiple structural ensembles separated by defined energy and/or kinetic barriers. The barrier for conversion of an inert to a seed-competent form of tau can apparently be overcome by incubation with heparin and/or incorporation into a fibril. In neurons, other factors such as post-translational modifications and heterologous binding events likely play a role. Identification of the factors that trigger conversion from inert to seed-competent forms will thus have obvious implications for understanding disease mechanisms.Isolation of seed-competent monomer from AD brain, with a very mild purification that explicitly excludes sonication or vigorous tissue homogenization, strongly suggests that this form of tau exists in vivo. Furthermore, we observed that both recombinant Ms and AD-derived Ms build multimeric assemblies in vitro far more efficiently than Mi or control-derived monomer. Thus, we hypothesize that a uniquely structured form of tau may be required for efficient assembly growth in cells. This contrasts with the idea that multimeric assemblies uniquely stabilize the conformation of otherwise unstructured proteins as they incorporate into the growing fibril, or that liquid-liquid phase separation with extremely high local concentration underlies tau aggregation (<Wegmann et al., 2018>). Instead, we imagine that the initiation of aggregation in human brain might begin with a stable transition of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form. To fully study this process will require more extensive biochemical purification of tau Ms from the earliest stages of disease.Ms has a remarkably stable structure, as it resists heat denaturation at 95°C for up to 3 hr. This suggests a heretofore unrecognized conformation of tau that, to account for its slow denaturation, likely involves multiple intra-molecular interactions involving short and long range amino acid contacts. XL-MS provides some indication of what these might be, and crosslinks between aa150 and R1/R2 appear to mark a seed-competent conformation. In agreement with the XL-MS results, we observed that heat inactivation of Ms seeding activity occurs with a lag phase, rather than first order time-dependent decay. This implies a complex tertiary structure in which Ms has multiple seed-competent intermediates. Future XL-MS studies performed at different temperatures could reveal these structures. With more advanced methods to interrogate the structure of monomeric tau in patient material, we imagine that ‘seed-competent monomer’ will in fact represent myriad structures, depending on the underlying disease. This could provide an explanation for how a single tau protein might self-assemble into diverse amyloid strains. We note with excitement a recent study of the yeast prion Sup35 from the Tanaka laboratory. Like tau, Sup35 is intrinsically disordered, yet they have observed local structure that influences the conformations of fibrils it can form (<Ohhashi et al., 2018>).Without further studies to identify structures of tau at higher resolution, we cannot know for certain why one form acts as a seed and another does not. However, we gained important insights when we modeled the configurations of R1R2 and R2R3 using Rosetta, with crosslinks as restraints. With obvious caveats, our models predicted that the local environment surrounding two hexapeptide motifs, VQIINK and VQIVYK, which are required for tau to form amyloid structures, may explain the differences between seed-competent and inert forms. In the models of Mi, and control brain-derived tau, these motifs lie buried in hairpin structures. By contrast, in Ms and AD-derived tau, both are exposed. VQIINK and VQIVYK thus might mediate intermolecular interaction in a growing assembly."
PMC6039173_9,"In support of our structural model, the proteolysis experiments corroborate differences in exposure of the VQIINK and VQIVYK sequences in the R1R2 and R2R3 regions between Mi and Ms  We note with great enthusiasm the recent study of Fitzpatrick et al. (<Fitzpatrick et al., 2017>), which defined critical sequences of tau within the amyloid core that are based on VQIVYK and adjacent amino acids. Indeed, it has been recently observed that heparin binding involves residues spanning 270–290, and promotes expansion of the remainder of the molecule (<Zhao et al., 2017>). This is consistent with our predictions of relative exposure of VQIINK/VQIVYK. The diversity of exposed core elements (almost certainly beyond VQIINK/VQIVYK) could specify the formation of assemblies that give rise to distinct strains, as suggested by work from the Tanaka laboratory (<Ohhashi et al., 2018>). Consistent with this idea, the Fitzpatrick et al. study indicates that in AD-derived tau fibrils the VQIVYK sequence plays a key role in the core amyloid structure (along with adjacent amino acids), but the VQIINK sequence does not (<Fitzpatrick et al., 2017>). We also note that multiple disease-associated mutations in tau affect residues in close proximity to VQIINK/VQIVYK. For example, our models predict that serine or leucine substitutions at P301 (which cause dominantly inherited tauopathy) would uniquely destabilize the local structure and promote exposure of the VQIINK/VQIVYK sequences. Future experiments will test these ideas more definitively.

Full-length (FL), wild-type (WT) tau contains two cysteines that create disulfide bridges and could complicate isolation of monomer. Thus in addition to preparing FL WT tau (2N4R) as previously described (<Frost et al., 2009b>), we purified FL tau (2N4R) that contains two cysteine/alanine substitutions (C291A, C322A), termed tau (2A). We used the 2A and WT forms of tau in our initial studies, before exclusively studying WT. Additionally, for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we engineered a single cysteine at the amino terminus (Cys-Tau (2A)) for labeling via maleimide chemistry. These modified proteins have fibrillization and seeding properties similar to FL WT tau. To initiate fibrillization, we incubated 8 µM tau in 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, and 8 µM heparin (1:1 ratio of FL tau to heparin) at 37°C for 72 hr without agitation. For cysteine labeling, we incubated 200 µL of 8 µM fibrils (monomer equivalent) and monomer with 0.025 mg of Alexa Fluor-488 (AF488) C5-maleimide (Invitrogen) and 80 µM Tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation. We quenched excess dye with 10 mM DTT for 1 hr at room temperature. For limited heparin exposure, recombinant tau at 1 µM was incubated with heparin at 1 µM for 15 min, 1 hr and 4 hr at 37°C before purification of monomer via Superdex 200 column.We employ the following terminology:Mi: This refers to ‘inert’ tau monomer, whether recombinant or derived from control brain.Ms: This refers to ‘seed competent’ monomer, whether derived from sonicated fibrils, heparin-treated monomer, or AD brain. We sonicated labeled and non-labeled fibrils using a Q700 Sonicator (QSonica) at a power of 100–110 watt (Amplitude 50) at 4°C for 3 hr. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min and 1 mL of supernatant was loaded into a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in PBS buffer at 4°C. After measuring the protein content of each fraction with a Micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA) and/or fluorescence using a plate reader (Tecan M1000), we aliquoted and stored samples at −80°C or immediately used them in biochemical studies and cell seeding assays. Each aliquot was thawed immediately before use. The molecular weight/radius of proteins in each fraction was estimated by running gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad): Thyroglobulin (bovine) 670 kDa/8.5 nm; γ-globulin (bovine) 158 kDa/5.29 nm; Ovalbumin (chicken) 44 kDa/3.05 nm; myoglobin (horse) 17 kDa/2.04 nm; and vitamin B121.35 kDa/0.85 nm. In a prior publication (<Mirbaha et al., 2015>), <Figure 1E>, we demonstrated through use of crosslinking with SDS-PAGE that the SEC protocol used in this work reliably purifies monomer, dimer, and trimer. Monomer, dimer and trimer fractions were passed through a 100 kDa MWCO filter (Corning) as instructed by the manufacturer (centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C). Filtered material was immediately collected and used in seeding assay along with the non-filtered samples of the same fraction at a final concentration of 100 nM, or analyzed by limited proteolysis. Protein concentration was determined before and after filtration by determining absorption at 205 nm. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed at 25°C on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1 cm optical path length. 200 μL of 2 μM Ms or Mi monomer was dialyzed onto 10 mM NaP and the spectra were measured at 0.10 nm intervals, with a band width of 1.0 nm, and scan speed of 10 nm/min. The spectrum represents the average of 4 scans in the range of 195 to 250 nm. A total tau ‘sandwich’ ELISA was performed similarly to that described previously (<Acker et al., 2013>). Antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine)."
PMC6039173_10,"96-well round-bottom plates (Corning) were coated for 48 hr at 4°C with DA-31 (aa 150–190) diluted in sodium bicarbonate buffer (6 µg/mL)  Plates were rinsed with PBS three times, blocked for 2 hr at room temperature with Starting Block (Pierce), and rinsed with PBS five additional times. SEC fractions were diluted in SuperBlock solution (Pierce; 20% SuperBlock, diluted in TBS), and 50 µL sample was added per well. DA-9 (aa 102–150) was conjugated to HRP using the Lighting-Link HRP Conjugation Kit (Innova Biosciences), diluted 1:50 in SuperBlock solution, and 50 µL was added per well (15 µg/mL). Sample +detection antibody complexes were incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed with PBS nine times with a 15 s incubation between each wash, and 75 µL 1-Step Ultra TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) was added. Plates were developed for 30 min, and the reaction quenched with 2M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an Epoch plate reader (BioTek). Each plate contained a standard curve, and all samples were run in triplicate. FCS measurements were conducted on a Confocal/Multiphoton Zeiss LSM780 Inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss-Evotec, Jena, Germany), using a 40X water immersion objective as previously described (<Chattopadhyay et al., 2002>). Fluorescently labeled tau from SEC fractions (in PBS) was excited at 488 nm and 561 nm for 30 s, recording 10 times (<Buschmann et al., 2003>). The data analysis was performed with Origin 7.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Stable cell lines were plated at a density of 35,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. After 18 hr, at 60% confluency, cells were transduced with protein seeds. Transduction complexes were made by combining [8.75 μL Opti-MEM (Gibco) +1.25 μL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)] with [Opti-MEM + proteopathic seeds] for a total volume of 20 μL per well. Liposome preparations were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before adding to cells. Cells were incubated with transduction complexes for 24 hr. Biosensor cells were confirmed as HEK293T by PowerPlex sequencing. Mycoplasma contamination was ruled out by PCR analysis using VenorGem (Sigma). Cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) for 10 min, then resuspended in flow cytometry buffer. The MACSQuant VYB (Miltenyi) was used to perform FRET flow cytometry. To measure CFP and FRET, cells were excited with a 405 nm laser, and fluorescence was captured with 405/50 nm and 525/50 nm filters, respectively. To measure YFP, cells were excited with a 488 nm laser and fluorescence was captured with a 525/50 nm filter. To quantify FRET, we used a gating strategy similar to that previously described (<Holmes et al., 2014>). The integrated FRET density (IFD), defined as the percentage of FRET-positive cells multiplied by the median fluorescence intensity of FRET-positive cells, was used for all analyses. For each experiment,~20,000 cells were analyzed in triplicate. Analysis was performed using FlowJo v10 software (Treestar). Recombinant full length (0N4R) tau monomer was purified as previously described (<Morozova et al., 2013>) at 1 mg/mL in BRB80 buffer (80 mM PIPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8 with 0.3M NaCl) and boiled at 100°C for 5 min with 25 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The tau protein solution was then rapidly diluted 1:5 and cooled to 20°C in PBS, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL of tau and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. This solution was supplemented with Thioflavin T (ThT) to a final concentration of 20 µM and filtered through a sterile 0.2 µm filter. Reaction sizes of 195 µL were aliquoted from the prepared protein stock and thoroughly mixed with 5 µL of each sample at 100 nM monomer equivalent, or 5 µL of buffer control. For each sample, three different technical replicates were prepared. An opaque 96-well plate was prepared with a 3 mm glass bead added to each well to increase agitation. The recombinant tau solution was added to the plate in 200 µl reaction volumes. The plate was sealed with sealing tape to prevent evaporation and incubated in the plate reader (SpectraMax M2) at 37°C. ThT fluorescence was monitored over time with excitation and emission filters set to 444 nm and 485 nm, respectively. Fluorescence readings were taken every 5 min, with agitation for 5 s before each reading. 0.5 g frontal lobe sections from AD patients at late Braak stage (VI) and age-matched controls lacking evident tau pathology were gently homogenized at 4°C in 5 mL of TBS buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) using a dounce homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. Supernatant was partitioned into aliquots, snap frozen and stored at −80°C. Immunopurification was performed with HJ8.5 anti-tau antibody (<Yanamandra et al., 2013>) at a ratio of 1:50 (1 µg mAb per 50 µg of total protein), incubating overnight at 4°C while rotating. To each 1 mL of mAb/brain homogenate we added 200 µL of a 50% slurry protein G-agarose beads (Santa-Cruz). We washed the bead with TBS buffer before overnight incubation at 4°C. We then centrifuged the complexes at 1000 x g for 3 min and discarded the supernatant. Beads were washed with Ag/Ab Binding Buffer, pH 8.0 (Thermo Scientific) three times. Tau bound to the beads was eluted in 100 µL low pH elution buffer (Thermo Scientific), incubated at room temperature for 7 min, followed by neutralization with 10 µL Tris-base pH 8.5. This elution step was repeated once more with 50 µL elution buffer and 5 µL Tris-base pH 8.5 for a total of 165 µL. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min, and the supernatant loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). SEC fractions were frozen at −80°C after evaluation of protein content by Micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific).To compare different extraction methods, fresh frozen frontal lobe section from an AD patient brain was suspended in TBS buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) at 10% w/vol in four portions. Samples were homogenized using three different devices: a dounce homogenizer, probe sonicator (Omni International), and tissue homogenizer (Power Gen 125, Fischer Scientific). We also included one more condition of homogenizing with tissue homogenizer followed by probe sonication for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. Supernatant was partitioned into aliquots followed by immunopurification.To control for release of tau Ms from fibrils in AD brain, a tau KO Mouse brain was divided into two halves, followed by spiking one half with recombinant fibrils and the other with fibril-derived Ms, both at final concentration of 10 µM monomer equivalent. Each was dounce homogenized, centrifuged, immunoprecipitated with HJ8.5 anti-tau antibody, and fractionated by SEC with identical techniques as used for human brain processing. SEC fractions were then used in seeding experiments. We analyzed the IFD from measurements of temperature-dependent seeding using global fits to a proposed unimolecular heat denaturation reaction. This analysis rests on the Arrhenius equation <Laidler, 1984>:where kU is the unfolding rate constant, E is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and A is the pre-exponential factor. For the unimodal model, the data were fit globally to:Here, t is the heat denaturation time and τ = 1/kU is the unfolding time. A second, multimodal model was deployed to account for discrepancies in the early time points which appeared to suggest the presence of a lag phase in denaturation. In this model, the data were fit globally towhere  is the lag time given byand B is a pre-exponential factor. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to evaluate the best model as it quantifies the trade-off between goodness of fit and the complexity of the model (<von Bergen et al., 2001>). For least squares model fitting, AIC can be reduced to:where p is the number of parameters in the model, n is the number of observations, and RSS is the residual sum of squares. The preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC."
PMC6039173_11,"Here, we find AIC = 123 for the unimodal model and AIC = 105 for the multimodal model, which suggests the multimodal model is a better description of the denaturation data  Mi and Ms tau samples were prepared as described above. In all cases, tau preparations were crosslinked at a total protein concentration of ~0.1 mg/mL using 10–20 µg starting material. The crosslinking buffer was 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. The crosslinking reaction was initiated by adding disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) stock solution (25 mM DSS-d0 and –d12, Creative Molecules) in DMF to a final concentration of 1 mM. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 min. For the heparin-derived Ms sample, heparin sulfate (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 5 µM, followed by 1 mM DSS and the samples were incubated for 1 min at 37°C. Excess reagent was quenched by addition of ammonium hydrogen carbonate to 50 mM and incubation at 37°C for 30 min, and then flash frozen at −80°C. Absence of higher molecular species was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and coomassie stain. After the quenching step, samples were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 8M urea. Proteins were reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP (37°C, 30 min) and alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (30 min, room temperature, protected from light). The sample solutions were diluted to 1M urea with 50 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate and trypsin (Promega) was added at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50. Proteolysis was carried out at 37°C overnight followed by acidification with formic acid to 2% (v/v). Samples were then purified by solid-phase extraction using Sep-Pak tC18 cartridges (Waters) according to standard protocols. Samples were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex Peptide column as described elsewhere (<Leitner et al., 2012>). Two fractions collected from SEC were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in water/acetonitrile/formic acid (95:5:0.1, v/v/v) to a final concentration of approximately 0.5 µg/µl. 2 µL each were injected for duplicate LC-MS/MS analyses on an Eksigent 1D-NanoLC-Ultra HPLC system coupled to a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid system (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on self-packed New Objective PicoFrit columns (11 cm x 0.075 mm I.D.) containing Magic C18 material (Michrom, 3 µm particle size, 200 Å pore size) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using the following gradient. 0–5min = 5 %B, 5–95min = 5–35%B, 95–97 min = 35–95%B and 97–107min = 95 %B, where A = (water/acetonitrile/formic acid, 97:3:0.1) and B = (acetonitrile/water/formic acid, 97:3:0.1). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode by selecting the five most abundant precursor ions (m/z 350–1600, charge state 3 + and above) from a preview scan and subjecting them to collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy = 35%, 30 ms activation). Fragment ions were detected at low resolution in the linear ion trap. Dynamic exclusion was enabled (repeat count 1, exclusion duration 30 s). Thermo. raw files were converted into the open. mzXML format using msconvert (proteowizard.sourceforge.net) and analyzed using an in-house version of xQuest (<Rinner et al., 2008>). Spectral pairs with a precursor mass difference of 12.075321 Da were extracted and searched against the respective FASTA databases containing Tau (TAU_HUMAN P10636-8).xQuest settings were as follows: Maximum number of missed cleavages (excluding the crosslinking site)=2, peptide length = 5–50 aa, fixed modifications = carbamidomethyl Cys (mass shift = 57.021460 Da), mass shift of the light crosslinker = 138.068080 Da, mass shift of mono-links = 156.078644 and 155.096428 Da, MS (<Chirita et al., 2005>) tolerance = 10 ppm, MS (<Kar et al., 2011>) tolerance = 0.2 Da for common ions and 0.3 Da for crosslink ions, search in ion-tag mode.For brain-derived samples we also included variable modifications including: Methionine oxidation = 15.99491, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation = 79.96633 and lysine ubiquitylation = 114.043 with nvariable_mod = 1. Post-search manual validation and filtering of the recombinant samples was performed using the following criteria: xQuest score >16, mass error between −4 and +7 ppm, %TIC >10, and a minimum peptide length of six aa. In addition, at least four assigned fragment ions (or at least three contiguous fragments) were required on each of the two peptides in a crosslink. False discovery rates (FDR) for the identified crosslinks were estimated using xprophet (<Rinner et al., 2008>). For the recombinant samples, Mi and Ms, the FDR ranged from 6–10%. Post-search manual validation of the brain-derived samples was performed using the following criteria: xQuest score >7, mass error between −5 and +7 ppm, %TIC >10, and a minimum peptide length of six aa. In addition, at least four assigned fragment ions (or at least three contiguous fragments) were required on each of the two peptides in a crosslink. The FDRs for the brain samples were much higher and ranged between 20–25%. For triplicate datasets (N = 3) corresponding to the Mi and Ms boiling time course we computed consensus crosslink profiles enforcing that at least two of the three datasets contain a crosslink. Crosslink data were visualized using Xvis (<Grimm et al., 2015>). Average contact distance was computed by averaging the sequence separation between crosslink pairs in a given dataset. See <Figure 7—source datas 1> and <2>. High confidence crosslink pairs identified above were used to generate an ensemble of possible structures using a Rosetta protocol employing the crosslink pairs as structural restraints. The integration of XL-MS derived restraints have been previously used to refine structural models of large complexes (<Leitner et al., 2012>) and simpler heterodimeric complexes (<Kahraman et al., 2013>). Based on distance distributions of crosslink pairs mapped onto crystallographic structures we set a lower bound of 15 Å and an upper bound of 25 Å for lysine Cα pairs in our simulations. Importantly, in our simulations we weighted the constraint pairs as to allow some distances above the upper bound limit. The fragment library was supplanted by using chemical shifts derived from fibrillar tau ssNMR assignments (bmrb entry 17920) using csrosetta (<Lange et al., 2012>). We generated 1000 models for each of the four XL-MS datasets on a high performance cluster (biohpc.swmed.edu). Representative structures were selected according to the low Rosetta score and radius of gyration. All plots were generated with gnuplot. All figures were generated using Pymol.

The enzyme to tau ratio was adjusted to 1:100 (wt/wt) with around 11 ug of Mi/Ms present initially. The total reaction mixture volume was 60 µl. Aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at 1, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min by using 10 µL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to quench the reaction (PH <3). The trypsin-digested peptides were then desalted using an Oasis HLB plate (Waters) and eluted with 100 µL 80% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% TFA.

Buffer A contained 2% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% formic acid in water, and buffer B contained 80% (v/v) ACN, 10% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, and 0.1% formic acid in water. The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode with a source voltage of 2.8kV and an ion transfer tube temperature of 275°C. MS scans were acquired at 240,000 resolution in the Orbitrap and up to 14 MS/MS spectra were obtained in the ion trap for each full spectrum acquired using collision-induced dissociation (CID), with charge one ions rejected. Dynamic exclusion was set for 15 s after an ion was selected for fragmentation. Raw MS data files were searched against the appropriate protein database from Uniprot, and reversed decoy sequences appended (<Elias and Gygi, 2010>) by using Protein Discovery 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fragment and precursor tolerances of 20ppm and 0.6 Da were specified, and 12 missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of Met was set as a variable modification. Label-free quantitation of proteins across samples was performed. Average peptide intensity values were computed for all time points for each peptide across triplicates (N = 3). To estimate differences in kinetic profiles we calculated the median value of each profile and compared the Mi to Ms ratio. See <Figure 10—source datas 1> and <2>. Tauopathies feature progressive accumulation of tau amyloids. Pathology may begin when these amplify from a protein template, or seed, whose structure is unknown. We have purified and characterized distinct forms of tau monomer—inert (Mi) and seed-competent (Ms). Recombinant Ms triggered intracellular tau aggregation, induced tau fibrillization in vitro, and self-assembled. Ms from Alzheimer’s disease also seeded aggregation and self-assembled in vitro to form seed-competent multimers. We used crosslinking with mass spectrometry to probe structural differences in Mi vs. Ms. Crosslinks informed models of local peptide structure within the repeat domain which suggest relative inaccessibility of residues that drive aggregation (VQIINK/VQIVYK) in Mi, and exposure in Ms. Limited proteolysis supported this idea. Although tau monomer has been considered to be natively unstructured, our findings belie this assumption and suggest that initiation of pathological aggregation could begin with conversion of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form. When doctors perform autopsies to look at the brain tissue of people with Alzheimer’s disease, they find toxic buildups of certain proteins – in particular, a protein called tau – in structures called ‘aggregates’. People with more severe dementia have more tau aggregates in their brain. Aggregates form when individual proteins stick together in repetitive patterns, much like the way a single Lego block might attach to another identical one. Like all proteins, tau is built from a string of amino acids that folds into a specific shape. Normally folded tau proteins do not form aggregates. It was not clear that an individual tau protein had two distinct forms—structures associated with health (“good”) or disease (“bad”).Mirbaha et al. have now studied the folding pattern of purified tau proteins with a sophisticated technology called mass spectrometry. This technique can measure changes in tiny amounts of protein. Some of the purified proteins had been extracted from human brains (from people with and without Alzheimer’s)."
PMC6039173_13,"To detect which of the proteins were toxic, Mirbaha et al  also grew simple human cells in a dish that were designed to react specifically to the bad forms of tau. This allowed the good and bad forms of tau to be isolated.Mirbaha et al. discovered that in the good form of tau the parts of the protein that allow it to stick to itself are hidden, folded inside. By contrast, the bad form of tau exposes the parts that allow it to aggregate, enabling the protein to build upon itself to form a large, toxic assembly.The shape-shifting concept established by Mirbaha et al. might apply to other proteins that form toxic aggregates. This could help us to better understand how many other neurodegenerative diseases develop and progress. Recognizing that the shapes that tau forms can be categorized as either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ may also help to develop new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. Drugs could be designed to stabilize the good form of tau, or to help remove the bad form from the brain. Furthermore, if the shape-shift described by Mirbaha et al. can be measured early enough in patients, it may allow treatments for Alzheimer’s before people have developed any detectable symptoms. ."
PMC4568963_0,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is regarded as one of the serious risk factors for age-related cognitive impairment; however, a causal link between these two diseases has so far not been established. It was recently discovered that, apart from high D-glucose levels, T2DM patients also display abnormally high concentrations of uric D-ribose. Here, we show for the first time that the administration of D-ribose, the most active glycator among monosaccharides, produces high levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and, importantly, triggers hyperphosphorylation of Tau in the brain of C57BL/6 mouse and neuroblastoma N2a cells. However, the administration of D-glucose showed no significant changes in Tau phosphorylation under the same experimental conditions. Crucially, suppression of AGE formation using an AGEs inhibitor (aminoguanidine) effectively prevents hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein. Further study shows AGEs resulted from ribosylation activate calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII), a key kinase responsible for Tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest that there is indeed a mechanistic link between ribosylation and Tau hyperphosphorylation. Targeting ribosylation by inhibiting AGE formation may be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent Alzheimer’s disease-like Tau hyperphosphorylation and diabetic encephalopathies.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that currently affects over 300 million people worldwide and is now treated as a potential pandemic. T2DM is characterized by high blood D-glucose and insulin resistance. Many patients with diabetes develop chronic or long-term complications, including nerve, eye, and kidney damage (Nathan, <1993>). Recent evidence suggests that patients with T2DM are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and that hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance can lead to memory impairment (Janson et al., <2004>). Previous work revealed the presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau in the brain of a T2DM animal model (Nathan, <1993>; Yang et al., <2006>; Liu et al., <2011>). Tau hyperphosphorylation is usually considered to be an early event in the process of neurofibrillary degeneration observed in AD, which is positively correlated with the diagnosis of dementia in patients with AD (Alafuzoff et al., <1987>; Kopke et al., <1993>). Abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau was discovered as the major protein subunit of paired helical filaments (PHFs) that form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (Iqbal et al., <2010>), with NFTs being a diagnostic hallmark of AD (Grundke-Iqbal et al., <1986>; Wang & Liu, <2008>). Therefore, Tau hyperphosphorylation may be also involved in cognitive impairment for T2DM patients.Glycation occurs between a carbonyl group from a reducing sugar and a free amino group of a protein. Glycation has been known for some time to be linked to T2DM (Anonymous, <1998>; Tan et al., <2002>) and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (Dukic-Stefanovic et al., <2001>). The glycation end products, resulting in linkages that are not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes, are called advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (Day et al., <1979>; Cloos & Christgau, <2002>). Li et al. (<2012>) prepared AGEs by incubation of BSA with 0.5 M D-glucose and then treated cells and rats with the AGEs. They found that AGEs can induce Tau hyperphosphorylation and impair synapse and memory through receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-mediated GSK-3 activation (Li et al., <2012>). However, whether high levels of reducing sugar, for instance D-glucose or D-ribose, can trigger Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment is still unclear.D-ribose is a naturally occurring pentose monosaccharide and an essential component for energy production in cells, apart from many other important biological functions (Mauser et al., <1985>; Keller et al., <1988>). It can come from the foods which contain high amounts of riboflavin, such as eggs, meat, and wheat bran. Also, it can be ingested as a supplement for cardiac energetic metabolism (Gross et al., <1991>; Murphy & Allen, <2003>; Shecterle et al., <2010>). The concentration of D-ribose is about 0.02 mm in human serum (Cai et al., <2005>), while D-glucose is 3.9∼6.1 mm in healthy human. The concentration of D-ribose in the cerebrospinal fluid is 0.01∼0.2 mm and glucose is 0.04∼1.6 mm (Seuffer, <1977>). Many years ago, Marks emphasized that pentose phosphate pathway is one of the important pathways for glucose metabolism in diabetes (Marks, <1956>). Segal and coworkers observed the decrease in blood D-glucose levels following the intravenous administration of 20 g of D-ribose to three diabetic subjects (Segal et al., <1957>). Bierman and colleagues used larger doses of D-ribose given to patients with both mild and severe diabetes and confirmed Segal’s finding (Bierman et al., <1959>). Hammes and collaborators used benfotiamine to block three major pathways of hyperglycemia damage and prevent experimental diabetic retinopathy (Hammes et al., <2003>). Su and colleagues found that D-ribose is significantly increased in the urine of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, accompanied with high levels of D-glucose (Su et al., <2013>), suggesting that T2DM is not only related with a dysfunction in D-glucose metabolism, but also in D-ribose metabolism (Su & He, <2014>). On the other hand, D-ribose is an efficient glycator (Chen et al., <2009>, <2010>; Wei et al., <2009>) and is much more active in protein glycation than D-glucose under identical conditions. D-ribose rapidly glycates protein, resulting in aggregation of protein with high concentrations of AGEs, which are highly toxic to cells (Wei et al., <2012a>; Lu & He, <2014>). Therefore,the efficacy of D-ribose and D-glucose in protein glycation and cytotoxicity should be investigated in a comparative manner.Calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) is one of the most abundant Ca2+-regulated protein kinases in the brain and is expressed primarily in neurons (Hunter, <1987>; Bulleit et al., <1988>). In the brain, CaMKII phosphorylates a broad range of substrate proteins, including Tau, tubulin, and MAP2 (Lindwall & Cole, <1984>; Baudier & Cole, <1987>). CaMKII is known to be regulated by Ca2+-/CaM-induced autophosphorylation at multiple sites, with Thr 286/287 (K/L subunits, respectively) being the major phosphorylation sites (Miller et al., <1988>). This autophosphorylation results in the conversion of CaMKII into its Ca2+-independent form, concomitant with the full activation of its total activity and the trapping of Ca2+/CaM (Kwiatkowski et al., <1988>; Ikeda et al., <1991>; Katoh & Fujisawa, <1991>; Hanson et al., <1994>; Ishida et al., <1996>). Removal of Ca2+/CaM from the autophosphorylated kinase stimulates Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation at Thr305 and/or Thr306. This Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation inhibits subsequent Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII, leading to a decrease in the activity of the kinase (Hashimoto et al., <1987>; Hanson & Schulman, <1992>; Colbran, <1993>). Thus, whether CaMKII participates in Tau hyperphosphorylation through CaMKII autophosphorylation of Thr286 or Thr305 remains to be elucidated."
PMC4568963_1,"High level of D-ribose in T2DM would induce more glycation, thus affected the brain, which might be a cause of cognitive impairment of patients (Han et al , <2011>; Su et al., <2013>). Investigation into the relationship between glycation and cognitive impairment should shed light on the precise mechanisms responsible for diabetic encephalopathy. However, the precise details of the mechanistic link between D-ribose/D-glucose and Tau phosphorylation remain ill-defined (Wei et al., <2012b>). In this study, we demonstrated that D-ribose induced Tau hyperphosphorylation in C57BL/6 animal brain and neuroblastoma N2a cells, whereas no such observation was made for D-glucose. Furthermore, we showed that the activation of CaMKII was directly involved in Tau hyperphosphorylation and that inhibition of AGE formation significantly reversed D-ribose-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation by CaMKII. As reported in our previous work, daily administration of D-ribose over the course of 30 days accelerates the AGE formation in the mouse brain and induces impairment of spatial learning and memory ability as measured in a Morris water maze test (Han et al., <2011>). To investigate why D-ribose, but not D-glucose, induces cognitive impairment in mice, we first observed Tau hyperphosphorylation in the presence of reduced monosaccharides. As shown by immunohistochemistry, phospho-Ser214 (pSer214) of Tau was significantly increased in the mouse brain sections (Fig.<1a>). Furthermore, pSer396 of Tau was also observed on the brain sections (Fig.<1b>). In contrast, the control experiment with D-glucose only showed a small increase for both pSer214 and pSer396 signals. These results indicate that the administration of D-ribose is able to trigger hyperphosphorylation of Tau in mouse brain, whereas D-glucose cannot. rhetorical Fig 1 Immunohistochemistry of Tau phosphorylation in the brain of mouse injected with D-ribose and D-glucose. Mice (C57BL/6J) were injected (i.p.) with D-ribose (rib) at a dose of 2 g kg−1, or D-glucose (glc) at a dose of 2 g kg−1, or 0.9% saline (control) daily for 30 days. Tau phosphorylation in the brain was detected in both cortex and hippocampus by immunohistochemistry using anti-pSer214 of Tau (panel a) and anti-pSer396 Tau (panel b) as indicated. As reported in our previous work, daily administration of D-ribose over the course of 30 days accelerates the AGE formation in the mouse brain and induces impairment of spatial learning and memory ability as measured in a Morris water maze test (Han et al., <2011>).

As shown in Fig.<2a> and <b>, a marked increase in pSer214 and pSer396 (P < 0.05, n = 5) was observed, which occurred in a D-ribose concentration-dependent manner, even though dephosphorylated form of brain Tau protein (Tau-1) actually decreased (P < 0.05, n = 5). The addition of D-glucose, however, did not initiate any significant changes in Tau phosphorylation (P = 0.68194, n = 5). This confirms that the administration of D-ribose triggers mouse brain Tau hyperphosphorylation, whereas D-glucose does not. rhetorical Fig 2 Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining of phosphorylated Tau in the mouse brain. Mice were injected (i.p.) with D-ribose or D-glucose or saline (control) daily for 30 days as indicated. Tau phosphorylation (anti-pSer214 and anti-pSer396) and nonphosphorylation (Tau-1, a monoclonal antibody against dephosphorylated Tau protein) were detected by Western blotting (20 μg brain lysate loaded). β-actin was used as a control (panel a). For each phospho-epitope, relative immunoreactive band intensities are expressed as a ratio to total Tau. For total Tau, relative values are expressed as a ratio to β-actin. Data are expressed as mean ± SD; * denotes P < 0.05 vs. control, respectively. Panel b shows the quantitative analyses of the data from panel a. n = 5. Immunofluorescent staining for Tau phosphorylation was visualized in 2 g kg−1 D-ribose-injected groups (panel c). Phosphorylated Tau (red), AGEs (green), and nuclei (blue) are shown. As reported in our previous work, daily administration of D-ribose over the course of 30 days accelerates the AGE formation in the mouse brain and induces impairment of spatial learning and memory ability as measured in a Morris water maze test (Han et al., <2011>).

The addition of D-glucose, however, did not initiate any significant changes in Tau phosphorylation (P = 0.68194, n = 5). This confirms that the administration of D-ribose triggers mouse brain Tau hyperphosphorylation, whereas D-glucose does not.Subsequent immunofluorescent experiments demonstrated the increase in phosphorylated Tau in the mouse brain (Fig.<2c>). However, the AGE staining signals probably did not colocalize with the signals for either pSer214 or pSer396 phosphorylation staining of Tau. There was also slight positive staining for mice injected with D-glucose (<Fig. S1>, Supporting information). As D-glucose is much slower in glycation reaction than D-ribose, time is also a factor in AGE formation. We have adopted a 3-month injection experiment with D-glucose. The D-glucose-injected mice did not exhibit cognitive impairment measured by Morris water maze (<Fig. S2a>,<b>, Supporting information). Long-term administration (3 months) of D-glucose induced increment of AGE production in the serum, but with slight increase in Tau phosphorylation in the brain (<Fig. S2c>, Supporting information).Together, these results clearly indicate that hyperphosphorylation of brain Tau protein at Ser214 and Ser396 occurs in the presence of D-ribose, but not D-glucose. To investigate Tau phosphorylation in the presence of D-ribose in the culture medium, we used a mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a cell line (N2a) as an in vitro model. To this end, N2a cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of D-ribose (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm), and the yield of AGEs was measured by Western blotting (Fig.<3a>). The levels of AGEs in N2a cells were markedly increased (P < 0.01, n = 5) in the presence of D-ribose at the concentrations of 10 mm and higher (Fig.<3a>′). Also, the yields of AGEs increased with increasing incubation times when using 10 mm D-ribose (Fig.<3b>,<b>′). These data indicate that ribosylation produces high levels of AGEs in N2a cells."

AGEs were detected by Western blotting (panel a,a′, 20 μg cell lysate loaded). Cell viability was measured using CCK-8 assay (panel c). D-ribose (final concentration 10 mm) was added to N2a cells and incubated for different time lengths (0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h), and AGE production (panel b,b′) and cell viability (panel d) were measured. n = 5. N2a cell lysate extracts were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and levels of phosphorylated Tau and AGEs were determined by Western blotting using antibodies directed at pThr181, pSer214, pSer396, or total Tau at different concentrations of D-ribose (panel e) and for different cell culture times (panel f). Panels e′ and f′ show quantitative analyses for data from panel e and f, respectively. n = 6.

Data are expressed as mean ± SD; * and ** denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 vs. control, respectively. To investigate Tau phosphorylation in the presence of D-ribose in the culture medium, we used a mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a cell line (N2a) as an in vitro model. To this end, N2a cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of D-ribose (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm), and the yield of AGEs was measured by Western blotting (Fig.<3a>). The levels of AGEs in N2a cells were markedly increased (P < 0.01, n = 5) in the presence of D-ribose at the concentrations of 10 mm and higher (Fig.<3a>′). Also, the yields of AGEs increased with increasing incubation times when using 10 mm D-ribose (Fig.<3b>,<b>′). These data indicate that ribosylation produces high levels of AGEs in N2a cells.Next, cell viability was assayed at different concentrations of D-ribose for different time durations (0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h) using a CCK-8 assay. As shown in Fig.<3c>, the viability of N2a cells decreased in a D-ribose concentration-dependent manner. While N2a cells were treated with 10 mm D-ribose for different time durations, the cell viability displayed an observable, but insignificant decrease when compared to control cells (Fig.<3d>). However, when cells were incubated in D-ribose of more than 20 mm, cell viability began to decrease markedly over a period of 24 h (data not shown). D-glucose, in contrast, did not incur any significant changes in cell viability at the concentrations used (<Fig. S3>, Supporting information). Thus, to investigate the correlation between D-ribose and Tau phosphorylation in more detail, the concentration of 10 mm D-ribose was employed for all further experiments unless stated otherwise. To demonstrate the utilization of D-ribose triggering Tau hyperphosphorylation, we determined the phosphorylation of Tau at Thr181, Ser214, and Ser396 phospho-epitopes in N2a cells. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of D-ribose (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm) for 24 h. As shown in Fig.<3e>,<e>′, incubation in 10 mm D-ribose resulted in a significant increase in Tau phosphorylation at Thr181, Ser214, and Ser396 (P < 0.01, n = 6), while the concentration of total Tau remained unchanged. Similar to mouse brain Tau phosphorylation, pSer214 was more sensitive to D-ribose exposure (as low as 5 mm). The primary neurons showed the same result (<Fig. S4>, Supporting information).Next, we treated N2a cells with 10 mm D-ribose for different time intervals (0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h) before measuring pThr181, pSer214, and pSer396 of Tau protein. Tau phosphorylation at these three phospho-epitopes markedly increased (P < 0.01, n = 6) in direct correlation with culture time (Fig.<3f>,<f>′), while levels of total Tau did not change significantly. In contrast, 10 mm of D-glucose did not show any significant effect on Tau phosphorylation or AGE formation (<Fig. S5>, Supporting information). Together, these results demonstrate that the presence of D-ribose in the media induces Tau hyperphosphorylation in N2a cells under our experimental conditions. To clarify the mechanism of D-ribose-induced hyperphosphorylation, we examined changes in the activation of specific Tau kinases commonly involved in the regulation of Tau phosphorylation. We explored the activation patterns in N2a cells of six kinases by employing specific antibodies. The treatment of 10 mm D-ribose for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in active form of CaMKII (p-Thr286), yet simultaneously in a decrease in inactive form of CaMKII (p-Thr305) phosphorylation (Fig.<4e>). The enzyme activity assay supported this result (<Fig. S6>, Supporting information). In contrast, the p-p38/p38 ratio (Fig.<4b>), p-JNK/JNK ratio (Fig.<4c>), p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β ratio (glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta, Fig.<4d>), and p35/25 ratio (Fig.<4f>) did not exhibit any marked changes when compared to their respective controls lacking D-ribose. Also, the p-ERK/ERK ratio (Fig.<4a>) did not markedly change, except when 50 and 100 mm D-riboses were used. Thus, our data suggest that CaMKII is activated by D-ribose and therefore could play a major role in Tau phosphorylation. rhetorical Fig 4 Changes in the levels of Tau kinases in N2a cells following the treatment of D-ribose. N2a cells were first treated with different concentrations of D-ribose for 24 h. Then, cell lysate extracts were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and levels of Tau kinases were determined using antibodies directed at activated or total kinases as follows: phospho-ERK/ total ERK (panel a), phospho-p38/ total p38 (panel b), phospho-JNK/ total JNK (panel c), phospho-GSK-3β/ total GSK-3β (panel d), phospho-CaMKII/ CaMKII (panel e), and p35/25 (panel f). N2a cells were incubated with 10 mm D-ribose for different lengths of time (0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h). N2a cell lysate extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and levels of Tau kinases were determined using antibodies directed at activated or total kinases as follows: phospho-ERK/ total ERK (panel g), phospho-p38/ total p38 (panel h), phospho-JNK/ total JNK (panel i), phospho-GSK-3β/ total GSK-3β (panel j), phospho-CaMKII/ CaMKII (panel k), and p35/25 (panel l).

Also, the p-ERK/ERK ratio (Fig.<4a>) did not markedly change, except when 50 and 100 mm D-riboses were used. Thus, our data suggest that CaMKII is activated by D-ribose and therefore could play a major role in Tau phosphorylation.The 10 mm D-ribose treatment experiments were also carried out for different time intervals, to confirm the results obtained as described above. Within the 24-h incubation period, a significant increase in p-CaMKII levels at Thr286 (P < 0.01, n = 3) was observed, together with a decrease at Thr305 (P < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig.<4k>). No significant changes were detected during the 48-h incubation for all other kinases tested (Fig<4h>,<i>,<j>,<l>), except for the p-ERK/ERK ratio (Fig.<4g>)."
PMC4568963_3,"Thus, this demonstrates once more that CaMKII is involved in Tau phosphorylation upon incubation with D-ribose of N2a cells To add further proof to our assumption that CaMKII plays a major role in D-ribose-induced Tau phosphorylation, we inhibited the activation of CaMKII using a specific inhibitor CK59 (Konstantopoulos et al., <2007>) and tested for suppression of Tau phosphorylation. Relative to the levels in the absence of the inhibitor, pSer214 levels were found to be significantly reduced in the presence of 10 μm CK59 (Fig.<5a>,<b>). Hundred μm CK59 significantly alleviated the levels of Tau phosphorylation for pThr181, pSer214, and pSer396 (P < 0.05, n = 3), among which pSer214 levels displayed the largest decrease (P < 0.01, n = 3). In the absence of D-ribose, CK59 also suppressed pThr181 and pSer214 phosphorylation, but not pSer396. Again, these data verify that CaMKII plays a major role in Tau hyperphosphorylation in the presence of D-ribose. rhetorical Fig 5 Effect of CK59 or aminoguanidine (AG) on D-ribose-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation. CK59 (10, 100 μm) was added to N2a cells together with D-ribose (10 mm), and cells were cultured for 24 h. Extracts of N2a cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, and levels of Tau phosphorylation were determined using antibodies directed at Tau pThr181, pSer214, pSer396, and total Tau (panel a). Data from panel (a) were quantitatively analyzed (panel b). AG (1, 5 mm) was added with D-ribose (10 mm) to N2a cells and cultured for 24 h. N2a cell lysate extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and levels of Tau phosphorylation and AGEs were determined using antibodies directed at Tau pThr181, pSer214, pSer396, total Tau (Tau-5), or AGEs (panel c). The same data from panel (c) were quantitatively analyzed (panels d, e). For each phospho-epitope, relative immunoreactive band intensities are expressed as a ratio to total Tau. For total Tau and AGEs, relative values are expressed as the ratio to β-actin. n = 3. Data are expressed as mean ± SD; *, ** and *** denote P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 vs. control, respectively. # denotes P < 0.05 vs. D-ribose treatment. To clarify the mechanism of D-ribose-induced hyperphosphorylation, we examined changes in the activation of specific Tau kinases commonly involved in the regulation of Tau phosphorylation. We explored the activation patterns in N2a cells of six kinases by employing specific antibodies. The treatment of 10 mm D-ribose for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in active form of CaMKII (p-Thr286), yet simultaneously in a decrease in inactive form of CaMKII (p-Thr305) phosphorylation (Fig.<4e>). The enzyme activity assay supported this result (<Fig. S6>, Supporting information). In contrast, the p-p38/p38 ratio (Fig.<4b>), p-JNK/JNK ratio (Fig.<4c>), p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β ratio (glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta, Fig.<4d>), and p35/25 ratio (Fig.<4f>) did not exhibit any marked changes when compared to their respective controls lacking D-ribose. Also, the p-ERK/ERK ratio (Fig.<4a>) did not markedly change, except when 50 and 100 mm D-riboses were used. Thus, our data suggest that CaMKII is activated by D-ribose and therefore could play a major role in Tau phosphorylation.The 10 mm D-ribose treatment experiments were also carried out for different time intervals, to confirm the results obtained as described above. Within the 24-h incubation period, a significant increase in p-CaMKII levels at Thr286 (P < 0.01, n = 3) was observed, together with a decrease at Thr305 (P < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig.<4k>). No significant changes were detected during the 48-h incubation for all other kinases tested (Fig<4h>,<i>,<j>,<l>), except for the p-ERK/ERK ratio (Fig.<4g>). Thus, this demonstrates once more that CaMKII is involved in Tau phosphorylation upon incubation with D-ribose of N2a cells.To add further proof to our assumption that CaMKII plays a major role in D-ribose-induced Tau phosphorylation, we inhibited the activation of CaMKII using a specific inhibitor CK59 (Konstantopoulos et al., <2007>) and tested for suppression of Tau phosphorylation. Relative to the levels in the absence of the inhibitor, pSer214 levels were found to be significantly reduced in the presence of 10 μm CK59 (Fig.<5a>,<b>). Hundred μm CK59 significantly alleviated the levels of Tau phosphorylation for pThr181, pSer214, and pSer396 (P < 0.05, n = 3), among which pSer214 levels displayed the largest decrease (P < 0.01, n = 3). In the absence of D-ribose, CK59 also suppressed pThr181 and pSer214 phosphorylation, but not pSer396. Again, these data verify that CaMKII plays a major role in Tau hyperphosphorylation in the presence of D-ribose.The levels of Tau phosphorylation are not only regulated by kinases, but also by phosphatases. We therefore examined the levels of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), the main Tau phosphatases. Tau is dephosphorylated by PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP5, with PP2A showing the strongest ability to do so (Wei et al., <2012b>). Western blotting results indicate that at the level of protein expression, there is no significant difference for PP2A between D-ribose-treated N2a cells and control cells (<Fig. S7>, Supporting information). Therefore, D-ribose appears to have no impact on the levels of PP2A phosphatase; thus, no clear correlation is evident between Tau hyperphosphorylation and changes in PP2A phosphatase levels, although some changes in phospho-Tyr307/PP2A were observed at higher concentrations of D-ribose (<Fig. S7a>,<a>′, Supporting information). The methylation level of PP2A showed little change in cells after D-ribose treatment, indicating methylation of PP2A did not involve in Tau hyperphosphorylation. The PP2A activity assay confirmed that D-ribose did not have an impact on PP2A activity (<Fig. S8>, Supporting information). Based on the results described above, it is clear that in N2a cells, D-ribose triggers the production of AGEs, followed by the induction of Tau hyperphosphorylation. Thus, whether D-ribose or ribosylated AGEs directly trigger Tau phosphorylation remains to be investigated. To this end, we employed aminoguanidine (AG), an effective inhibitor for the production of AGEs to answer this question. In the presence of AG, the levels of AGEs decreased significantly (P < 0.01, n = 4), to about half compared to that for the control (Fig.<5c>,<d>). Five mm AG completely alleviated the increase in AGEs observed in the presence of D-ribose in N2a cells. Importantly, the addition of AG not only reduced the production of AGEs, but resulted in a significant decline in signal for three Tau phospho-epitopes (pThr181, pSer214, and pSer396) as observed during incubation with D-ribose (P < 0.05, n = 3), compared to the sample without inhibitor (Fig.<5c>,<e>). Similarly, upon the addition of AG, the highest reduction was observed for the Ser214 phosphorylation site of Tau (P < 0.01, n = 3) when compared to the sample without inhibitor. AG can also suppress the activation of CaMKII under ribose treatment (<Fig. S9>, Supporting information). Thus, our results suggest that Tau hyperphosphorylation was a result of ribosylated AGEs, rather than due to a direct reaction involving D-ribose. In the work presented here, we investigated the possible mechanistic link between T2DM and age-related cognitive impairment. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has recently been shown to be one of the major risk factors for developing AD (Qu et al., <2012>). To understand the causal relationship between these two diseases, we investigated whether there is a mechanistic link between two key observations, namely elevated levels of D-ribose in T2DM on the one hand (Su & He, <2014>) and Tau hyperphosphorylation, an early event in the development of age-related dementia during progression of AD, on the other."

Here, we show that the CaMKII (but not GSK-3β) was activated in the presence of 10 mm D-ribose, indicating that CaMKII has the potential to play an important role in the phosphorylation of Tau in the presence of ribosylated AGEs. This mechanism of Tau hyperphosphorylation differs from that induced by glucosylated AGEs, where GSK-3 is activated instead (Li et al., <2012>), and ribosylated and glucosylated AGEs enhance Tau phosphorylation using different kinase pathways. Note that D-glucose does not show any direct effect on Tau phosphorylation except for glucosylated AGEs. In our experimental setup, in contrast, these other kinases (ERK1/2, JNK, p38, p25/35, and GSK-3) did not appear to play any role in Tau hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, the increase in Tau phosphorylation is most likely a result of the activation of CaMKII in N2a cells. CaMKII is thought to be an important mediator of learning and memory. As CaMKII is implicated in long-term potentiation (LTP), D-ribose-induced activation of CaMKII may influence LTP of cells. The precise role of CaMKII for the formation of AGEs will need to be investigated in more detail in future studies, using both in vitro and in vivo model systems.Among the phosphorylation sites investigated here (Ser214, Thr181, and Ser396), Ser214 was the most sensitive site to D-ribose exposure. Its phosphorylation status changed in a D-ribose concentration-dependent manner. In agreement with our findings, earlier work presented evidence that the phosphorylation at Ser214 is upregulated in AD-affected brains (Sadik et al., <2009>). Furthermore, this phosphorylation site has been described as a specific marker for AD earlier (Ksiezak-Reding et al., <2003>). Also, Ser214, together with Thr212, is located in the consensus phosphorylation sequence of CaMKII (RXXS/T), and non-fetal-type phosphorylation sites of Tau, which may produce PHF-Tau (Yoshimura et al., <2003>). Yang et al. found that Ser214 is significantly hyperphosphorylated in a T2DM rat model (Yang et al., <2010>). In this work, Ser214 may be directly responsible for the changes in the levels of D-ribose as well as ribosylated AGEs. Altogether, these results suggest that the CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of Tau (Ser214) is critically involved in the pathogenesis of both age-related cognitive impairment and diabetic encephalopathy (Sima, <2010>). But it should also be noted that D-ribose not only induced the phosphorylation of Tau but also other proteins in the cell, for instance CaMKII.We choose aminoguanidine (AG) as an inhibitor of ribosylation and, as expected, observed the inhibition of accumulation of ribosylated AGE. Interestingly, it also suppressed Tau phosphorylation, in particular at the site pSer214, suggesting that AG can inhibit glycation, which would then reduce AGE levels and thus indirectly reduce the signals associated with Tau phosphorylation.As mentioned above, D-ribose produces high levels of AGEs, which in turn triggers hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Therefore, Tau phosphorylation is a direct result of ribosylated AGEs and only indirectly caused by D-ribose. This viewpoint is based on our observations as described in the results section and those of others, as cited above. Tau hyperphosphorylation is observed in the presence of D-ribose following the formation of AGEs in N2a cells. Tau phosphorylation markedly decreased upon inhibition of AGE formation in the presence of the inhibitor AG.Figure<6> depicts the process of Tau hyperphosphorylation in the presence of D-ribose. D-ribose, as the most active glycator, reacts quickly with cellular proteins and produces higher yields of AGEs compared with D-glucose. The ribosylated forms of AGEs then activate CaMKII, which in turn catalyzes the phosphorylation of Tau protein. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau finally results in cell dysfunction, usually ending in cell death. At least in N2a cells, this procedure can be suppressed in vitro by adding AG, resulting in the inhibition of AGE production. rhetorical Fig 6 The proposed mechanism of D-ribosylation-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation.

Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau finally results in cell dysfunction, usually ending in cell death. At least in N2a cells, this procedure can be suppressed in vitro by adding AG, resulting in the inhibition of AGE production.When looking at the correlation between cell viability and Tau phosphorylation, we found that the viability of N2a cells begin to decrease at a concentration of 10 mm D-ribose, albeit only observably compared to controls, while Tau was hyperphosphorylated at the same concentration. Also, the AGEs level measured by Western blot showed to increase from 10 mm. This concentration of D-ribose (10 mm) seems to be the turning point of cell state. As Tau hyperphosphorylation is the early event in AD development, our results could be utilized to build a cellular model to simulate the initiation of Tau hyperphosphorylation by D-ribose. We not only found Tau hyperphosphorylation in D-ribose-treated cells and animals, but also linked it with glycation. These results should encourage future investigations into the details of the link between glycation and Tau modification.The administration of 5–10 mm D-ribose induces the increase in Tau phosphorylation, but phosphorylated Tau did not increase in the presence of 20–100 mm D-ribose. One possible explanation for this observation is that the viability of N2a cells under these conditions suffered, and the cells stopped responding to D-ribose at such high concentrations. As reported, 20 mm D-ribose induced astrocytic inflammation (Han et al., <2014>). However, the p-ERK/ERK ratio did not change drastically, except for D-ribose concentrations higher or equal to 50 mm. In the absence of D-ribose, the addition of 100 μm CK59 also suppressed the levels of pThr181 and pSer214, which became lower than the normal control except for pSer396. This suggests that CaMKII has a background activity under physiological conditions, and it is further inactivated in the presence of CK59.In the D-ribose-treated mouse brain, there seems no colocalization of the signal for either pS214 or pS396 phosphorylation staining of Tau and the AGE staining. This may be because D-ribose induced AGEs formation, then CaMKII activation, and finally Tau hyperphosphorylation, as we observed in N2a cells and depicted in Fig.<6>. So AGEs probably did not trigger Tau hyperphosphorylation directly.In our opinion, AGEs derived from D-glucose and D-ribose should be different in the quantities and characteristics as AGEs derived from ribose are more cytotoxic than those derived from glucose, and the difference of the molecular structures between D-ribose and D-glucose. However, the detailed different properties need more investigation.In conclusion, using in vitro and in vivo evidence, we established a mechanistic link between elevated levels of D-ribose and hyperphosphorylated Tau, the molecular basis for the appearance of neurofibrils, which have been shown previously to be directly linked to the development of age-related dementia during progression of AD. This work represents evidence that there is indeed a biochemical link between these two devastating illnesses that affect an ever-increasing number of people worldwide, adding strength and depth to the overall idea that AGEs may play a role in AD.Therefore, targeting glycation and AGEs may present a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent AD-like Tau hyperphosphorylation and thus diabetic encephalopathy. Antibodies utilized in this study were directed against phosphorylated Tau at the following epitopes: pThr181 (1:1000 dilution; Signalway antibody, College Park, Maryland, USA), pSer214 (1:2000; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), pSer396 (1:2000; Invitrogen), and Tau-1 (anti-nonphosphorylated Ser199/202 of Tau, 1:4000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Total Tau was detected using Tau-5 (1:2000; Millipore). Monoclonal antibodies against AGE (1:2000, 6D12; Wako, Osaka, Japan) and β-actin (1:5000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas, USA) were employed.Changes in Tau kinase levels were examined using phospho-calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II (CaMKII, Thr305, 1:1000; Millipore) and p25/p35 (1:2000; Beyotime, Haimen, China), and the following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling: GSK-3β (1:2000) and phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9, 1:2000), p44/42 MAPK (ERK 1/2, 1:2000) and phospho-ERK/1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204, 1:2000), p38 MAPK (1:1000) and phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182, 1:1000), SAPK/JNK (1:1000) and phospho-SAPK-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185, 1:1000), and total CaMKII (1:1000) and phospho-CaMKII (Thr286, 1:1000).Changes in Tau phosphatases were examined using PP2A-C subunit (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), phospho-PP2A (Tyr307, 1:2000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and PP2A (methyl Leu309, 1:1000; Abcam). The Western blotting of dilution experiments was shown in <Fig. S10> (Supporting information). Male C57BL/6J mice (8–10 weeks) were obtained from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). After 1 week of acclimatization, mice were randomly divided into five groups and, for 30 days, received either daily intraperitoneal injections of D-ribose, at doses of 0.2 or 2 g/kg, D-glucose at identical doses, or 0.9% saline (controls). There were 12 mice for each group. All mice were maintained in approved animal facilities under pathogen-free conditions. After behavioral testing, mice were sacrificed and their brains were immediately dissected out, homogenized in lysis buffer (Beyotime), and then centrifuged, to yield both supernatants for Western blots, and samples for fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde to be used for immunohistochemistry experiments."

Immunolabeled tissues were observed under an Olympus FV500 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro 2A (N2a) cells (obtained from Cell Resource Center, Beijing, Amresco, Solon, OH, China) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 100 IU mL−1 penicillin and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO2. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 60-mm-diameter dishes and fed every fourth day. Cells were incubated with D-ribose (Amresco, USA) at the concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm for 24 h, or 10 mm for 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h, or cultured with or without AG or CK59 for 24 h. Cells were then collected for cell viability testing and preparation of cellular extracts for Western blots. Cell viability was assessed using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Beyotime). N2a cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 104 cells per well and exposed to D-ribose after 24 h, except for the control. For serial dilution tests, the final concentrations of D-ribose used were 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm and the CCK-8 reagent was added 24 h later. For testing of different incubation times, the final concentration of D-ribose was 10 mm and the CCK-8 reagent was added at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h after adding D-ribose. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and the absorbance recorded at 450 nm. In the preparation of cell lysate protein extract for D-ribose exposure, N2a cells were transferred into 6-well plates at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells per well. D-ribose treatment was performed 24 h later. After indicated periods of time, the growth medium was removed by aspiration, and each well was washed two times with 1 mL of PBS. The cells were harvested in ice-cold WIP buffer (Beijing Cellchip Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor (1 mm PMSF). The samples were then centrifuged at 20 000 g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected and analyzed for protein content using a bicinchoninate acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were stored at −80 °C until further use for immunoblotting analysis. Protein samples of brain tissues and cell lysate were mixed with 5 × SDS-PAGE Sample Buffer (Genstar, China) and boiled for 10 min. Expression levels of phosphorylated Tau, total Tau, and Tau kinases and phosphatases were determined using SDS-PAGE coupled with Western blotting. Cell lysate extracts containing ∼ 30 μg protein were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). Nonspecific binding sites of the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies directed against total Tau, phosphorylated Tau, specific Tau kinase or phosphatase, AGEs, or β-actin. The following day, membranes were washed three times and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution; ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China). The membranes were washed again three times with PBST, and the immunoreactive bands were then visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Applygen, Beijing, China). The immunoreactive bands were visualized after exposure of the membranes to Kodak X-ray film and quantified by Quantity One 1D analysis software 4.5.2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). All values reported represent means ± standard deviation (SE), except where otherwise indicated. Data were analyzed employing Adobe Photoshop 8.0.1, Adobe Syterm, San Jose, CA, USA, Origin 8.0, OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA, and Microsoft Excel 2010 statistical software, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA. When there were multiple bands present, we used all bands for statistical analysis. For animal experiment, ‘n’ means the number of mice used. For cell experiments, ‘n’ means independent experiments. Differences between experimental groups were considered significant at a probability < 0.05 on a two-tailed test; * and ** denote P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 vs. control, respectively. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is regarded as one of the serious risk factors for age-related cognitive impairment; however, a causal link between these two diseases has so far not been established. It was recently discovered that, apart from high D-glucose levels, T2DM patients also display abnormally high concentrations of uric D-ribose. Here, we show for the first time that the administration of D-ribose, the most active glycator among monosaccharides, produces high levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and, importantly, triggers hyperphosphorylation of Tau in the brain of C57BL/6 mouse and neuroblastoma N2a cells. However, the administration of D-glucose showed no significant changes in Tau phosphorylation under the same experimental conditions. Crucially, suppression of AGE formation using an AGEs inhibitor (aminoguanidine) effectively prevents hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein. Further study shows AGEs resulted from ribosylation activate calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII), a key kinase responsible for Tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest that there is indeed a mechanistic link between ribosylation and Tau hyperphosphorylation.

In the present study we first assess the substrate specificity of TTBK2 and demonstrate that it has an unusual preference for a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position relative to the phosphorylation site. We elaborate a peptide substrate (TTBKtide, RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSIYpA) that can be employed to quantify TTBK2 kinase activity. Through modelling and mutagenesis we identify a putative phosphate-priming groove within the TTBK2 kinase domain. We demonstrate that SCA11 truncating mutations promote TTBK2 protein expression, suppress kinase activity and lead to enhanced nuclear localization. We generate an SCA11-mutation-carrying knockin mouse and show that this leads to inhibition of endogenous TTBK2 protein kinase activity. Finally, we find that, in homozygosity, the SCA11 mutation causes embryonic lethality at embryonic day 10. These findings provide the first insights into some of the intrinsic properties of TTBK2 and reveal how SCA11-causing mutations affect protein expression, catalytic activity, localization and development. We hope that these findings will be helpful for future investigation of the regulation and function of TTBK2 and its role in SCA11.

M.J.B. and L.C.C. are supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant number GM56203]. Previous studies have revealed that mutations within TTBK2 (tau tubulin kinase 2) cause a serious autosomal dominant inherited movement disorder termed SCA11 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 11) [<1>,<2>]. SCA11 is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal features, peripheral neuropathy and, on occasion, dystonia, with age of onset from the early teens to the mid-20s [<3>]. TTBK2 is closely related to a neuronal specific protein kinase termed TTBK1, which was discovered in 1995 as a protein kinase in bovine brain extract that phosphorylated tau and tubulin [<4>]. TTBK2 consists of 1244 residues and apart from an N-terminal serine/threonine protein kinase domain (residues 20–280) possesses no distinctive functional domains or motifs.Thus far four distinct SCA11 families have been identified, each possessing a mutation leading to premature termination of the TTBK2 protein at around residue 450. This leaves the kinase catalytic domain intact, but eliminates most of the non-catalytic portion of the enzyme (<Figure 1A>). One of the affected families from Devon, U.K., stretches over eight generations (family 1 in <Figure 1A>) [<1>]. All affected individuals of this family displayed progressive cerebellar ataxia, abnormal eye signs and pyramidal features, as well as cerebellar atrophy visible upon magnetic resonance imaging [<1>]. Neuropathological examination of the brain blocks of one affected family-1 individual revealed gross atrophy of the cerebellum accompanied by severe and near-complete loss of Purkinje cells, with a marked preservation of the basket cells, and a significant loss of cerebellar granule cells [<1>]. There were also changes consistent with pathological aging, with some tangles and β-amyloid-positive plaques observed in the neocortex, hippocampus, transentorhinal, entorhinal and insular cortex [<1>].TTBK2 belongs to the CK1 (casein kinase 1) group of eukaryotic protein kinases composed of CK1 isoforms (CK1α, CK1α2, CK1δ, CK1ε, CK1γ1, CK1γ2 and CK1γ3), VRK (vaccinia-related kinase) isoforms (VRK1, VRK2 and VRK3) and TTBK isoforms (TTBK1 and TTBK2) [<5>]. CK1 differs from most other protein kinases by the presence of the sequence S-I-N motif instead of A-P-E in kinase domain region VIII [<6>]. TTBK1 and TTBK2 possess a P-P-E motif at this site. TTBK2 possesses 38% identity with CK1δ within the kinase domain, but there is no obvious homology beyond the catalytic moiety of TTBK to CK1 or VRK isoforms. TTBK1 and TTBK2 share 84% identity within the catalytic domain and also display significant homology in the non-catalytic region.TTBK isoforms have been found in many species including, mouse, zebrafish, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila [<7>]. TTBK1 is mainly expressed in neuronal tissues [<8>], whereas TTBK2 is more widely expressed and has been observed in tissues including heart, muscle, liver, thymus, spleen, lung, kidney, testis and ovary [<9>,<10>]. In situ hybridization showed that TTBK2 mRNA was present in all brain regions in human, rat and mouse [<1>]. The highest expression of TTBK2 mRNA was observed in the cerebellum Purkinje cells, granular cell layer, hippocampus, midbrain and substantia nigra [<1>]. Lower expression was seen in the cortex of human, rat and mouse brains [<1>].Biochemical investigations initially identified a proteolytic fragment of the catalytic domain of TTKB2, encompassing residues 1–316, in various brain extracts that was capable of phosphorylating tau at two sites (Ser208 and Ser210) [<9>,<10>]. Phosphorylation of these residues primes tau for phosphorylation by isoforms of glycogen synthase kinase-3, an enzyme that has also been suggested to modulate tau pathology [<11>]. TTBK1 was reported to phosphorylate tau at four residues (Ser198, Ser199, Ser202 and Ser422) [<8>]. More recently, overexpression of TTBK1 in mouse was reported to enhance phosphorylation and oligomerization of tau in the brain [<12>]. Whether endogenous TTBK1 and/or TTBK2 regulate phosphorylation of endogenous tau has not been established. Recent genetic studies have also implicated TTBK1 in Alzheimer’s disease and in tangle formation [<13>,<14>]. Thus far only one brain from a SCA11 family-1 patient has been analysed and it displayed some tau deposition [<1>]. This may suggest that TTBK2 could be involved in regulating tau, but much further investigation is required to substantiate this conclusion.Despite this previous work, little is understood about TTBK2 substrate specificity and how SCA11 truncating mutations affect protein expression, kinase activity, stability and localization. We have therefore undertaken an initial analysis of TTBK2 substrate specificity and shown that it has a conspicuous preference for a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position relative to the phosphorylation site. We exploit this information to develop an optimized peptide substrate to assess TTBK2 catalytic activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SCA11 truncating mutations markedly enhance TTBK2 protein expression, lead to inhibition of TTBK2 kinase activity and promote nuclear localization. We generate TTBK2-knockin mice expressing an SCA11 disease causing mutation and confirm that this results in the inhibition of endogenous protein kinase activity. We find that, in homozygosity, the SCA11 mutation causes embryonic lethality. These findings will help with further investigations into the function and regulation of TTBK2, as well as its role in SCA11.

The Flp-in T-REx system was purchased from Invitrogen and stable cell lines were generated following the manufacturer instructions by selection with hygromycin.The coding region of full-length human TTBK2 was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 4829013 (NCBI accession number BC071556) and subcloned as a NotI-NotI fragment into several expression vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange® method (Stratagene) with KOD polymerase (Novagen) in the presence of DMSO. All DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, which was performed by the DNA Sequencing Service, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, U.K. A fragment of the mouse TTBK2 fusion protein encompassing residues 314–385 with an N-terminal GST (glutathione transferase) tag was expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione–Sepharose chromatography. After cleavage of the GST tag, TTBK2-(314–385) was used as an immunogen to raise a sheep polyclonal antibody (S572C). Antibodies were affinity purified from antisera using the TTBK2-(314–385) protein immunogen. An anti-GST antibody was raised in sheep against the GST protein (S902A, first bleed). An anti-GFP (green fluorescent protein) antibody (S268B) was raised in sheep against recombinant GFP protein and affinity purified against the antigen. Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Thermo Scientific and fluorescent secondary antibodies used for the Odyssey Infrared System were from Rockland. Cell lysates (20–30 µg) and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS/PAGE electrophoresis (10% gels) and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 20 min at room temperature (20 °C) in 10%(w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 1%Tween 20). All primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were used at 1 µg/ml in 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk in TBS-T. Secondary antibodies used were either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or fluorescent antibodies. For immunoprecipitations, the anti-TTBK2 antibody was covalently coupled to Protein G–Sepharose beads at a ratio of 1 µg of antibody/µl of beads using a DMP (dimethyl pimelimidate) procedure, or GFP-antibody-coupled beads were used. The indicated amount of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a 5 µl bead volume of coupled antibody for 1 h, washed twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and twice with Buffer A. Immunoprecipitates were either subjected to protein kinase activity as described below or to immunoblot analysis. Peptide kinase assays were set up in a total volume of 50 µl in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM [γ-32P] ATP (~500–1000 c.p.m./pmol) in the presence of the indicated concentration of peptide substrate. The assays were performed for 20 min at 30 °C. When purified proteins were used, reactions were terminated by applying 40 µl of the reaction mixture on to P81 phosphocellulose paper. In the case of immunoprecipitated TTBK2, reactions were terminated by adding 10 µl of 0.2 MEDTA and gentle mixing. After a short spin, 50 µl of the reaction was spotted on to P81 phosphocellulose paper. After extensive washing in 50 mM phosphoric acid, reaction products were quantified by Cerenkov counting. Km and Vmax parameters were calculated using the Michaelis–Menten model of non-linear regression with the GraphPad Prism V5 program. HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 Flp-in T-REx stable cell lines harbouring GFP-tagged wild-type and mutant forms of TTBK2 were generated using standard protocols. Cells were grown on coverslips and induced with 0.1 µg/ml doxycycline for 16 h. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% (v/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde) at room temperature and washed twice for 5 min. After permeabilization in PBS containing 1%(v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, cells were incubated for 10 min with donkey serum (diluted 1:10; Sigma) and then for 1 h with 0.5 µg/ml anti-TTBK2 antibody. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 594) diluted 1:500 in PBS. After three further washes with PBS, cells were incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 10 min and mounted on to slides using Hydromount (National Diagnostics). Images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using an α Plan-Apochromat ×100 objective. GFP-expressing cell lines were fixed and stained with DAPI to identify their nuclei. Fields of cells selected on the basis of the DAPI staining were chosen at random, and single optical sections through the nucleus and cytoplasm in the DAPI and GFP channels were collected sequentially on the Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using the α Plan-Apochromat ×100 objective. These images were quantified using the image-processing software Volocity (PerkinElmer). The nuclei were identified using the DAPI channel and the average GFP nuclear intensity was measured for each cell. Whole cells including the nuclei were identified from the GFP channel and the area of the previously identified nuclei was removed from these areas. The average intensity in the remaining cytoplasm was then measured for each cell. The nuclear intensity was then expressed as a ratio of the cytoplasmic intensity in order to avoid variability in protein expression by the cells. For each cell line, between 260 and 460 cells were counted over ten fields of cells. Animal studies were approved by the University of Dundee Ethics Committee and performed under a U.K. Home Office project license. Animals were obtained from Harlan and Taconic Artemis and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. The knockin mice were generated by Taconic Artemis on an inbred C57BL/6J background as described in <Figure 5>. Genotyping was performed by PCR on DNA extracted from ears or embryonic membranes. Primers 1 (5′-CATTTGTTGGCATTATTTCAAAGG-3′) and 2 (5′-AGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAACATGG-3′) were used to detect the wild-type and knockin alleles. The PCR programme consisted of 2 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 10 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles. To generate embryos, TTBK2 heterozygous mice were crossed and embryonic development was estimated considering the day of vaginal plug observation as 0.5 d.p.c. (days post coitum). Pregnant females were killed and uterine horns were collected in PBS. The embryos were dissected from the decidua in M2 medium (Sigma) at room temperature and fixed in 4%(v/v) PFA for 2 h and washed and stored in PBS for phenotypic analysis. MEFs were generated from embryos at 9.5–10.5 d.p.c. Embryos were removed from the M2 medium and placed in trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. From this stage, embryos were cultured in advanced DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium)/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%(v/v) FBS (fetal bovine serum), 1×MEM(minimal essential medium) non-essential amino acids, 2 mM l-glutamine and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. We initially used the positional scanning peptide library approach [<15>,<16>] to probe the substrate specificity preferences of TTBK2. This assay employs 198 biotinylated peptide libraries that each contain a 1:1mixture of serine and threonine at the central position and one additional position fixed to one of the 20 amino acids, as well as phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. Phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were included to allow substrate specificity analysis of kinases such as CK1, to which TTBK2 is related, that have preferences for priming phosphorylation sites. All other positions contained an equimolar degenerate mixture of natural amino acids (except serine, threonine and cysteine). We screened the 198 libraries using [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant TTBK2-(1–450) or kinase-inactive TTBK2[D163A]-(1–450) expressed in HEK-293 cells. Biotinylated peptides were then captured on a streptavidin-coated membrane. The relative amino acid preference at each position was determined by quantifying 32P-radioactivity incorporation following phospho-imaging."
PMC3739326_2,"The key striking preference observed from this analysis was for a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position downstream from the site of phosphorylation (<Figure 1B>)  For experiments undertaken with the kinase-inactive TTBK2[D163A], vastly lower overall levels of phosphorylation were observed with no preference for a +2 phosphotyrosine. As TTBK2 is a member of the CK1 family, we decided to verify whether TTBK2 would phosphorylate a model peptide substrate termed CK1tide that is frequently employed to assess CK1 isoform activity [<17>]. CK1δ phosphorylates CK1tide (RRKDLHDDEEDEAMS*ITA) at the serine residue marked with an asterisk [<17>], and we confirmed that TTBK2-(1–450) also phosphorylates CK1tide specifically at this serine residue (see <Supplementary Figure S1> at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/437/bj4370157add.htm). Next, we investigated the effects of introducing a phosphotyrosine residue at every position from the −5 to the +4 residue. This confirmed the findings of the positional scanning peptide library approach, revealing that introducing a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position, but not at any other position, strongly promoted peptide phosphorylation, principally by decreasing the Km value approximately 8-fold (<Figures 1C and 1D>). The CK1tide peptide with a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position was named TTBKtide (RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSIYpA). Introducing a phosphothreonine rather than a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position failed to enhance peptide phosphorylation (<Figure 1D>). Replacing the phosphorylated serine residue in TTBKtide with a threonine residue did not effect phosphorylation by TTBK2, but replacement with a tyrosine residue abolished phosphorylation (<Figure 1D>). CK1 isoforms possess a well-known requirement for priming phosphorylation [<18>–<20>]. The crystal structures of yeast CK1 [<21>] (PDB code 1EH4) and human CK1δ [<22>] (PDB code 1CKI) reveal the presence of a sulfate-binding groove on the small lobe of the kinase domain, predicted to function as the phosphate-priming site (<Figure 2A>). Four highly conserved basic lysine and arginine residues on CK1 isoforms form ionic interactions with the sulfate residue (<Figure 2A>). Three of these residues are conserved in TTBK1 and TTBK2 (Lys50, Lys143 and Arg181). The fourth residue is an alanine in TTBK2 (Ala184) as well as in TTBK1 (<Figure 2B>). To verify whether these residues on TTBK2 could be involved in enhancing phosphorylation of +2-phosphotyrosinecontaining substrates, we studied the effect that mutation of Lys50, Lys143, Arg181 and Ala184 had on the phosphorylation of TTBKtide. Mutation of Lys50 or Lys143 to either glutamic acid or alanine inactivated/destabilized TTBK2 (see <Supplementary Figure S2A> at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/437/bj4370157add.htm) and equivalent mutations in CK1δ had similar effects (<Supplementary Figure S2B>). In contrast, mutation of Arg181 or Ala184 did not affect stability (<Figure 2C>) or the intrinsic TTBK2 kinase activity as judged by the ability of these mutants to phosphorylate a peptide lacking the +2 phosphotyrosine residue (<Figure 2D>). However, the ability of TTBK2[R181A or R181E] or TTBK2[A184G or A184E] mutants to phosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated TTBKtide was markedly impaired (Km values of 100–150 µM compared with 18 µM for wild-type TTBK2) (<Figure 2D>). These results suggest that TTBK2 possesses a phosphate priming groove similar to CK1, except that it is involved in recognizing +2 phosphotyrosine residues rather than N-terminal phosphoserine/phosphothreonine. Next, we investigated how disease-causing truncation mutations affect TTBK2 protein expression as well as kinase activity. We generated HEK-293 cells that stably express GFP-tagged versions of full-length TTBK2, family-1 and family-2 disease variants of TTBK2 (see <Figure 1>) as well as a TTBK2-(1–450) truncation mutant. We observed that both family-1 and family-2 mutations and residue-450-truncation mutants were expressed at higher levels than full-length wild-type or kinase-inactive GFP–TTBK2[D163A] (<Figure 3A>). Similarly, we also observed increased expression of the truncation mutants of TTBK2 possessing FLAG (see <Supplementary Figure S3A> at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/437/bj4370157add.htm) or GST (<Supplementary Figure 3B>) tags.Monitoring the rate of degradation following pulse-labelling of cells with [35S]methionine revealed that both wild-type and disease-mutant family-1 TTBK2 displayed a similar ~24 h half-life in HEK-293 cells, indicating that there was not a significant difference in the rate at which these proteins were degraded in cells (see <Supplementary Figure S4> at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/437/bj4370157add.htm).Next, we immunoprecipitated GFP–TTBK2 variants and quantified their intrinsic activity employing the TTBKtide peptide substrate. We calculated specific activity of wild-type and mutant forms of TTBK2 by normalizing for differences in protein expression using quantitative LICOR immunoblot analysis. This revealed that full-length wild-type TTBK2 possessed approximately 10-fold higher specific activity than the family-1 and family-2 disease mutants or the TTBK2-(1–450) mutant (<Figure 3A>). The kinase-inactive full-length TTBK2[D163A] or truncated TTBK2[D163A]-(1–450) displayed no detectable activity, establishing that activity of TTBK2, rather than that of a contaminating kinase, was being measured (<Figure 3A>). Similar analysis of the specific activity of wild-type and mutants of TTBK2 variants with FLAG (<Supplementary Figure S3A>) or GST (<Supplementary Figure S3B>) epitope tags confirmed that SCA11 truncating mutations markedly suppressed kinase activity. We analysed the cellular localization of stably expressed variants of GFP–TTBK2 in HEK-293 cells. This revealed that full-length wild-type TTBK2 (<Figure 4>, panel 1) or full-length kinase inactive TTBK2[D163A] (<Figure 4>, panel 2) was expressed at higher levels in the cytosol than the nucleus. However, TTBK2-(family-1 mutation) (<Figure 4>, panel 3) or truncated TTBK2-(1–450) (<Figure 4>, panels 4 and 5) were expressed at similar levels in both the cytosol and the nucleus. Quantification of the ratios of nuclear compared with cytosolic TTBK2 established that an approximately 2-fold higher proportion of TTBK2-(family-1 mutation) and truncated TTBK2-(1–450) is localized in the nucleus compared with full-length TTBK2 (<Figure 4>, panel 7). Knockin mice that precisely mimic the one-base insertion of adenosine in exon 13 at nucleotide 1329, observed in SCA11 family 1 [<1>], were generated as shown in <Figure 5>. We observed that heterozygous TTBK2fmly1/+ (where fmly1 is family 1) mice were viable and fertile. The oldest TTBK2fmly1/+ mice we have thus far analysed are ~1 year of age and display no overt phenotype. Anatomical dissection of 1-year-old mouse brains also revealed no discernable abnormality. Breeding of heterozygous TTBK2fmly1/+ mice resulted in no homozygous TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 mice being born (<Figure 6A>), indicating that the homozygous mutation resulted in embryonic lethality. We therefore dissected embryos at different stages of development and found that at E10 (embryonic day 10) TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 embryos were detected at the expected Mendelian frequency, but displayed major abnormalities compared with littermate TTBK2fmly1/+ or TTBK2+/+ embryos. By stage E11, no homozygous TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 embryos were observed, suggesting that these embryos perished before this stage. Homozygous E10-TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 embryos were developmentally delayed, lacking prominent subdivisions of the developing brain, and were smaller than wild-type littermates (<Figure 6B>). These embryos failed to complete embryonic turning movements or undergo normal caudal extension of the body; in several cases the rudimentary caudal body, which contained some somites (future vertebrae, muscle and dermis) and spinal cord, remained folded back on more rostral tissues (<Figure 6B>). This distortion and underdevelopment of the main body axis (<Figure 6B>) are the probable causes of embryonic lethality. Next, we analysed endogenous TTBK2 expression and activity in various mouse tissues."
PMC3739326_3,"This revealed significantly higher levels of TTBK2 protein and activity in brain and testes than other tissues investigated (<Figure 7A>)  In wild-type TTBK2+/+ brain and testes, TTBK2 migrated on an SDS/PAGE gel at the expected ~150 kDa size. As predicted, in tissues of the heterozygous TTBK2fmly1/+ mice the level of full-length TTBK2 was reduced by ~50%and a truncated form of TTBK2 migrating at ~50 kDa that was not seen in the wild-type mice was observed (<Figure 7B>). We also analysed endogenous TTBK2 catalytic activity after immunoprecipitation from brain and testes extracts and found that TTBK2 activity was reduced ~40–50% in tissues derived from heterozygous TTBK2fmly1/+ compared with wild-type littermate animals, consistent with the truncating mutation suppressing TTBK2 catalytic activity (<Figure 7B>).We also analysed TTBK2 activity in MEFs derived from wild-type TTBK2+/+, heterozygous TTBK2fmly1/+ and homozygous TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 littermate stage-E10 embryos. TTBK2 activity derived from homozygous TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 cells was ~90%lower than activity observed in wild-type TTBK2+/+ fibroblasts (<Figure 7C>). The heterozygous TTBK2fmly1/+ displayed intermediate TTBK2 activity. We have undertaken the first characterization of TTBK2 catalytic activity and substrate specificity, and we find that it possesses a marked preference for a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position from the site of phosphorylation (<Figure 1>). Sequence comparisons indicate that TTBK2 possesses a phosphate-priming binding site in its catalytic domain equivalent to that in related CK1 isoforms. We find that mutating two key conserved residues within this putative phosphate-binding groove (Arg181 or Ala184) did not affect the ability of TTBK2 to phosphorylate a nontyrosine-phosphorylated peptide, but inhibited phosphorylation of a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide (<Figure 2>). The residues making up this putative phosphate-binding pocket are conserved on TTBK1, suggesting that this isoform may also possess a preference for +2-residue phosphotyrosine priming. The key difference in the putative phosphate-binding groove between CK1 and TTBK1/TTBK2 is the presence of a non-basic alanine residue in TTBK1 and TTBK2 rather than a basic lysine residue in all CK1 isoforms. It would be interesting to explore whether this contributes towards the preference of TTBK2 for phosphotyrosine rather than phosphoserine/phosphothreonine priming in CK1 isoforms.One of the most-studied consensus phosphorylation sites for CK1 isoforms is S/Tp-X-X-S/T, where S/Tp refers to a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine, X refers to any amino acid and the underlined residues refer to the target site [<18>–<20>]. In the case of CK1, the priming phosphorylation site is at the −3 position rather than at the +2 position for TTBK2. If both TTBK2 and CK1 use a similar phosphate-binding site within their catalytic domain, there would need to be marked differences in the mechanism and orientation at which primed phosphorylated substrates interact with CK1 and TTBK2. In future work, it would be interesting to co-crystallize the catalytic domain of TTBK2 with a +2-tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide to define the molecular mechanism by which TTBK2 interacts with such substrates and establish whether this putative phosphate-binding groove we have analysed is involved. To our knowledge, the structure of CK1 bound to an S/Tp-X-X-S/T-motif-containing peptide has not been reported, but would be of interest to compare with that of TTBK2. It would also be important to mine phosphorylation-site databases for proteins phosphorylated on Sp/Tp-X-Yp motifs and determine whether any of these proteins might comprise physiological substrates for TTBK2.Our analysis has enabled us to elaborate a reasonable peptide substrate for assessing TTBK2 activity (TTBKtide-RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSIYpA) that is phosphorylated with a Km of 18 µM and a Vmax of 76 units/mg. We have used this assay to investigate how SCA11 truncating mutations affect TTBK2 activity and demonstrated that two familial SCA11 mutations analysed induce an ~10-fold reduction in TTBK2 protein kinase activity. Truncation of TTBK2 at residue 450, in close proximity to where the familialTTBK2truncatingmutations occur, similarly suppressed TTBK2 activity. The observations that TTBK2 immunoprecipitated from TTBK2fmly1/+ mice possessed ~40%less activity (<Figure 7B>) and TTBK2 immunoprecipitated from TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 MEFs (<Figure 7C>) had ~10-fold lower activity also support the notion that SCA11 mutations drastically reduce endogenous TTBK2 activity. Thus these findings indicate that loss of TTBK2 activity could underpin the development of SCA11 in patients.It will be important to study in more detail the mechanism by which the SCA11 truncating mutations lead to suppression of TTBK2 protein kinase activity. The SCA11 truncating mutations leave the kinase catalytic domain intact, removing a C-terminal non-catalytic region possessing no obvious functional domains (<Figure 1A>). The removal of the C-terminal non-catalytic region of TTBK2 might delete a motif required for kinase activation, activity or proper folding of the catalytic domain. Depending upon the mechanism by which SCA11 mutations suppress TTBK2 catalytic activity, it may be worth undertaking a drug screen to determine whether it is possible to identify compounds that could lead to the re-activation of truncated TTBK2 mutants. Such compounds could have potential for treating patients with SCA11.The truncated TTBK2 mutants were expressed in HEK-293 cells at significantly higher levels than the full-length wild-type enzyme (<Figure 3> and <Supplementary Figure S3>). However, in the testes and brain of TTBK2fmly1/+ mice, more similar levels of expression of the endogenous truncated and full-length forms of TTBK2 were observed (<Figure 6>). Although the relative expression of full-length and truncated mutants of TTBK2 in patients with SCA11 mutations has not yet been investigated, TTBK2 mRNA levels from lymphoblasts of affected individuals were significantly lower compared with lymphoblast mRNA from unaffected individuals [<1>]. This suggests that the premature stop codon in the TTBK2 mRNA leads to nonsense-mediated decay of mutated mRNA. It is still likely that some of the truncated SCA11 protein is expressed in SCA11 patients, as the mutant transcript was still detected [<1>]. Treating lymphoblasts from SCA11-affected individuals with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of nonsense-mediated decay, increased TTBK2 mRNA to levels that are similar in the normal transcript [<1>]. Taking these data into consideration, it is therefore possible that the truncated TTBK2 protein is indeed expressed at much higher levels than the full-length protein, but due to nonsense-mediated decay, less of the truncated protein is produced. This could account for why similar levels of wild-type and truncated mutant protein are observed in the TTBK2fmly1/+ mice. In future work it will be important to analyse the relative levels of wild-type and mutant Ttbk2 mRNA in TTBK2fmly1/+ mice. We also detected enhanced nuclear localization of the truncated forms of TTBK2, indicating that inappropriate localization within the nucleus could potentially contribute to the mechanism by which mutations in TTBK2 lead to SCA11. Potentially, the truncated TTBK2 mutants result in the inappropriate phosphorylation of nuclear proteins.The developmental delay and small size of homozygous TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 embryos are consistent with a role for TTBK2 activity in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes, such as cell proliferation. The failure of embryonic turning and underdevelopment of the body axis might also lead to a poor placental connection and hence embryonic lethality. TTKB1 expression is prominently localized in cortical and hippocampal neurons [<8>]. Further insight into the TTKB2 phenotype and its role in spinocerebellar ataxia would be gained by establishing its expression pattern, particularly with respect to its localization in the cerebellum."
PMC3739326_4,"The TTBK2fmly1/+ mice as well as TTBK2fmly1/fmly1 MEFs will be useful in the validation of potential TTBK2 substrates that are identified In conclusion, our present study provides some initial insights into substrate specificity of TTBK2 and how SCA11-causing mutations affect kinase activity and localization. In future studies, it will be important to define the substrates that TTBK2 phosphorylates and investigate whether reduced phosphorylation of these targets contributes to the development of SCA11. In particular, it would be interesting to determine whether physiological TTBK2 substrates are primed with a +2 phosphotyrosine and how regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation is coupled to the control of these TTBK2 targets. Identifying the key targets of TTBK2 could provide vital new insights into the molecular mechanism underpinning the development of spinocerebellar ataxia and result in new ideas as to how this debilitating disease might be better treated in the future. rhetorical Figure 1 (A) Schematic representation of the domain structure of TTBK2 showing the location of the three reported SCA11-causing mutations.

PMC3739326_5,"In the present study we first assess the substrate specificity of TTBK2 and demonstrate that it has an unusual preference for a phosphotyrosine residue at the +2 position relative to the phosphorylation site  We elaborate a peptide substrate (TTBKtide, RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSIYpA) that can be employed to quantify TTBK2 kinase activity. Through modelling and mutagenesis we identify a putative phosphate-priming groove within the TTBK2 kinase domain. We demonstrate that SCA11 truncating mutations promote TTBK2 protein expression, suppress kinase activity and lead to enhanced nuclear localization. We generate an SCA11-mutation-carrying knockin mouse and show that this leads to inhibition of endogenous TTBK2 protein kinase activity. Finally, we find that, in homozygosity, the SCA11 mutation causes embryonic lethality at embryonic day 10. These findings provide the first insights into some of the intrinsic properties of TTBK2 and reveal how SCA11-causing mutations affect protein expression, catalytic activity, localization and development. We hope that these findings will be helpful for future investigation of the regulation and function of TTBK2 and its role in SCA11. ."
PMC4808800_0,"Abnormal deposition of misprocessed and aggregated proteins is a common final pathway of most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is characterized by the extraneuronal deposition of the amyloid β (Aβ) protein in the form of plaques and the intraneuronal aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in the form of filaments. Based on the biochemically diverse range of pathological tau proteins, a number of approaches have been proposed to develop new potential therapeutics. Here we discuss some of the most promising ones: inhibition of tau phosphorylation, proteolysis and aggregation, promotion of intra- and extracellular tau clearance, and stabilization of microtubules. We also emphasize the need to achieve a full understanding of the biological roles and post-translational modifications of normal tau, as well as the molecular events responsible for selective neuronal vulnerability to tau pathology and its propagation. It is concluded that answering key questions on the relationship between Aβ and tau pathology should lead to a better understanding of the nature of secondary tauopathies, especially AD, and open new therapeutic targets and strategies.

PRH is supported in part by NIH grant P50 AG005138. We also thank Mate Babić for help in preparation of schematics. The Bavarian psychiatrist Aloysius (Alois) Alzheimer is credited with the first description of the most characteristic pathological brain change—neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)—of a yet-unnamed disease in a 51-year-old woman from Frankfurt am Main, who had developed dementia. That woman was the first person to receive a diagnosis of the disease for which in 1910 Emil Kraepelin coined the term Alzheimer’s disease (AD; which he wrongly, albeit cautiously, initially described as “presenile dementia”). Her name was Auguste Deter and she had an early-onset dementia, comorbid with psychotic features. As she became progressively worse, she had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in November 1901 (where Alzheimer examined her for the first time), where she eventually died in April 1906. Besides the already known “miliary foci” of extracellular deposits scattered over the cerebral cortex (more commonly later called senile plaques, SP, or neuritic plaques, NP), by using a newly developed silver staining method (20% water solution of silver nitrate, [<1>]) Alzheimer observed degenerating cortical neurons with bundles of intracellular fibrils (neurofibrillary tangles, NFT) [<2>,<3>].It was not until 1963 that with the help of electron microscopy, Kidd and Terry independently reported NFT to be made up of abnormal filaments alternating between 15 (at their narrowest point) and 30 nm (at their widest point) in width, with a half-periodicity of about 80 nm [<4>,<5>]. Because it appeared that the two filaments were wound helically around one another, Kidd named them paired helical filaments (PHF). Also found in NFT of AD, as a minority species, was the so-called straight filament (SF), a filament about 15 nm wide that does not exhibit the marked modulation in width shown by the PHF. Due to the fact that PHF were observed to be insoluble in denaturing agents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea, despite significant efforts the structural and molecular composition of PHF (and NFT) was not elucidated until the mid-1980s [<6>,<7>]. Morphological studies of fragmentation patterns showed that the PHF actually consists of a left-handed helical ribbon consisting of repeating symmetrical subunits. Using electron diffraction, Crowther and Wischik were able to establish conclusively that the PHF is made up of a double helical stack of transversely oriented C-shaped subunits, each of which has three domains. This structure precluded purely descriptive models available to that point based on rearrangements of preformed cytoskeletal polymers or protofilaments. They concluded that the structure was of a type that might arise from the de novo assembly of a single structural subunit, the biochemical identity of which was then unknown. Later studies showed that SF were composed of a similar structural subunit although with a slightly different relative arrangement in the two types of filaments [<8>]. Tau (tubulin-associated unit) protein was isolated from porcine brain extracts as a heat-stable, highly soluble protein essential for microtubule (MT) assembly [<9>]. Following the initial discovery of tau, two studies reported the process of tau purification and its physical and chemical properties [<10>,<11>], including the ability of tau to become phosphorylated. In 1983, it was discovered that tau could be phosphorylated at multiple sites by various protein kinases, including cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinases and casein kinase type-1 [<12>]. Further studies showed that tau is a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation negatively regulates its ability to stimulate MT assembly [<13>,<14>].An immunohistochemical study that compared the localization of tau using the tau-1 antibody (that recognizes all isoforms of tau, see below) with that of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and tubulin in human postmortem brain tissue demonstrated that tau protein was primarily localized to axons [<15>]. Using the same tau-1 monoclonal antibody and electron microscopy with colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibodies, tau was also found in very low amounts in astrocytes [<16>] and oligodendrocytes [<17>], and this was confirmed by tau mRNA expression analysis in the mouse brain [<18>]. The insolubility of PHF precluded biochemical characterisation of the repeating subunit that makes up the structural core of the filament. What was required was a means of solubilising or releasing the structural subunit as a protein band that could be visualised by gel electrophoresis and linking this by immuno-electron microscopy to the PHF. Initial attempts based on relatively crude preparations of NFT were unable to distinguish between proteins copurifying with NFTs due to trapping and loose association within the dense filament bundles, and proteins derived from the structural core of the PHF. In 1985 Brion and collaborators prepared tau and MAP2 proteins from the adult rat brain using the microtubule assembly-disassembly method and their property of thermostability; they then generated antisera against tau and MAP2 proteins using polypeptides extracted from polyacrylamide gels after electrophoretic separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) [<19>]. Antisera were characterized by immunoblotting on purified preparations of tau and MAP2 and found to react with their cognate antigens. These antisera were then used for immunocytochemistry on tissue sections from control subjects and AD patients: the anti-MAP2 antibody did not label NFT but the anti-tau antibody strongly immunolabelled NFT and abnormal neurites around senile plaques, yielding an immunolabelling indistinguishable from the one obtained with anti-PHF serum [<19>]. This work therefore established that tau protein was one of a number proteins associated with NFTs both histologically and in crude NFT extracts. Neurofibrillary tangles can be labeled histologically with antibodies against a variety of other neuronal proteins, including vimentin, actin, ubiquitin, MAP2, and Aβ protein. In crude NFT preparations, isolated NFT could be labeled with antibodies against MAP2, neurofilament, ubiquitin and tau [<19>,<20>,<21>,<22>,<23>,<24>,<25>,<26>,<27>,<28>,<29>]."
PMC4808800_1,"The proof that tau protein contributes to the structural core of the PHF required preparation of fractions highly in enriched in proteolytically stable PHF which retained the subunit structure of the filament that had been characterised previously  These PHF were solubilised in formic acid and when examined by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis were found to contain predominantly a 12-kD protein and a corresponding dimer. Surprisingly, this protein was not recognised by an antibody raised against tau protein. Conversely, a monoclonal antibody raised against the enriched core PHF preparations (mAb 6.423, referred to as MN423) did not recognised purified tau protein [<30>,<31>,<32>,<33>]. Nevertheless, MN423 was shown by immunogold electron microscopy to label the proteolytically stable core of the PHF. Furthermore, a ligand related to primulin [<34>] was used to affinity label the 12-kD species. This ligand, when bound covalently to biotin, was also shown by immunogold electron microscopy to label proteolytically stable core PHF. Therefore, the provenance of the 12-kD protein from the structural core of the PHF was unequivocally established by two independent approaches. Partial amino acid sequences derived from this band were unrelated to any protein sequence known at that time. However, when these were used to clone and sequence the corresponding cDNAs from a human brain library, the predicted protein was found to be 352 amino acids in length and was found to have extensive homology to the sequence of the mouse microtubule-associated protein tau isoform that had just been published [<35>,<36>]. It was concluded that this protein must constitute the human homolog of mouse tau, and that tau protein therefore must contribute to the structural core of the PHF, and was not simply a loosely associated protein copurifying with NFT. These data were therefore able to explain the earlier observations linking tau protein with NFT [<21>,<37>,<38>,<39>,<40>,<41>]. In the same year tau cDNA clones were identified in the human fetal brain by flow sorting and spot-blot hybridization and later on assigned to the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) on the long arm of the chromosome 17 [<42>,<43>]. In their 1988 paper, Goedert and collaborators also mentioned that they had identified a second form of tau, with sequence variation in the first repeat, and suggested that tau mRNA was undergoing alternative splicing [<34>]. This second form was identical to the first, with the exception of an additional insert of 31 amino acids in the repeat region. Upon sequencing of genomic clones, the extra repeat was shown to be encoded by a separate exon, now known as exon 10. This work uncovered the existence of at least two types of tau isoforms in the human brain, with three repeats (3R tau) or four repeats (4R tau) of a conserved tubulin-binding motif [<44>]. Sequencing of a large number of cDNA clones revealed the existence of additional tau isoforms with two (29-N1, and 59 amino acid-N2) inserts in the N-terminus region (due to alternative splicing of exons 2 and 3), in combination with both three and four repeats (<Figure 1>). With the isoforms described previously, this gave a total of six human brain tau isoforms ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids in length [<45>]. The primary sequence of the longest tau isoform is shown in <Figure 2>. The most prominent expression of tau was observed during fetal development, when only the shortest (referred to as fetal tau) isoform (N0R3) is expressed (352 amino acids with molecular weight of 45 kDa), while the adult human brain expresses all isoforms with R4 to R3 ratio equal to 1 [<46>]. Relative amounts of N0, N1 and N2 tau isoforms are 37%, 54% and 9%, respectively [<46>]. There is a further larger transcript of tau that encodes for a protein of 110 kDa with an additional 254 amino acids in the N-terminal projection arm, but this protein is generally restricted to the peripheral nervous system [<47>]. rhetorical Figure 1 Chromosomal location of the gene and protein structure for the microtubule-associated proteins tau, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAP4. Tau exons 2, 3 and 10 are alternatively spliced, giving rise to six different mRNAs, translated in six different tau isoforms. Tau isoforms differ by the absence or presence of one or two 29 amino acid inserts encoded by exon 2 (yellow) and 3 (orange) in the N-terminal part, in combination with either three (R1, R3 and R4) or four (R1-R4) repeat regions in the C-terminal part. The R2 repeat is encoded by exon 10. The longest 2N4R adult tau isoform (2+3+10+) has 441 amino acids (aa), followed by 1N4R isoform of 412 aa (2+3−10+), 2N3R isoform of 410 aa (2+3+10−), 0N4R isoform of 383 aa (2−3−10+), 2N3R isoform of 381aa (2+3−10−) and the shortest 0N3R isoform of 352 aa (2−3−10−). The single neuron-specific promoter of MAPT gene has three binding sites for transcription factors and its activity increases with axon initiation and outgrowth. The shortest tau isoform is the only one expressed in the fetal brain (“fetal tau”), while expression of other isoforms begins postnatally (for a review, see [<48>]). The MAP2 and MAP4 have comparable repeat domain sequences in the C-terminus but differ from tau proteins by their longer N-terminal projection arms.

[<50>]). This finding fitted well with the previous findings obtained using monoclonal [<51>] and polyclonal tau antibodies [<52>]. Epitopes recognised by tau antibodies and phosphorylation sites on tau protein are shown in <Figure 3>. In 1991, Lee and collaborators purified PHF using a method comparable to that of Greenberg and Davis [<53>], and using protein chemical analysis claimed that they are made entirely of full-length hyperphosphorylated tau protein [<53>].In 1992, it was shown that, after dephosphorylation, the PHF-tau bands aligned with the recombinant tau isoform mixture, indicating that PHF-tau consists of all six tau isoforms in a hyperphosphorylated state [<46>]. These studies led to the widely quoted view that PHF are composed entirely of full-length hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This view was challenged by the Wischik group who, using another monoclonal antibody (mAb 7.51), also raised against enriched proteolytically stable core PHF and recognizing all tau isoforms, showed that phosphorylated tau protein released from PHF preparations by the sarkosyl method was not quantitatively related to the total PHF-tau protein content present in these preparations, whether these were prepared with or without exogenous proteases [<54>,<55>]. Indeed the proportion of full-length, phosphorylated tau protein was found biochemically to account for less that 5% of total PHF-tau in the bulk PHF fraction prepared without protease, and less than 15% in the sarkosyl PHF preparation. Although PHF isolated without protease digestion can be immunolabeled by tau antibodies directed against phosphorylation-dependent epitopes located in the N-terminal half of the molecule, this immunoreactivity is lost after proteolytic removal of the fuzzy coat [<30>,<31>]. The fuzzy coat consists of the lengthy N-terminal portions of tau molecules that cover the surface of the filaments and are readily sensitive to proteolytic digestion. Such digestion leaves intact the proteolytically stable core structure comprising the left-handed helical or straight ribbon of repeated C-shaped subunits. In other words, the fuzzy coat comprising phosphorylated tau does not contribute to the structural core of the PHF. Core PHF have a mass of 65 kD/nm, whereas 90% of PHF isolated without proteases is 77 kD/nm, with a further 10% having a mass of 110 kD/nm [<31>]. The core PHF therefore accounts for ~85% of the mass of the filament, with a variable addition of fuzzy coat material which contributes ~12 kD/nm. rhetorical Figure 3 Putative phosphorylation sites on tau protein and epitopes specific for major tau antibodies.

With the isoforms described previously, this gave a total of six human brain tau isoforms ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids in length [<45>]. The primary sequence of the longest tau isoform is shown in <Figure 2>. The most prominent expression of tau was observed during fetal development, when only the shortest (referred to as fetal tau) isoform (N0R3) is expressed (352 amino acids with molecular weight of 45 kDa), while the adult human brain expresses all isoforms with R4 to R3 ratio equal to 1 [<46>]. Relative amounts of N0, N1 and N2 tau isoforms are 37%, 54% and 9%, respectively [<46>]. There is a further larger transcript of tau that encodes for a protein of 110 kDa with an additional 254 amino acids in the N-terminal projection arm, but this protein is generally restricted to the peripheral nervous system [<47>].Enriched preparations of PHF from extracts of homogenates from AD brains by using N-lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) and 2-mercaptoethanol, after removal of aggregates by microfiltration, sucrose density centrifugation and immunoblotting, revealed three tau bands of 60, 64, and 69 kDa ([<49>]; a minor fourth band of 72 kDa being described later by Mulot et al. [<50>]). This finding fitted well with the previous findings obtained using monoclonal [<51>] and polyclonal tau antibodies [<52>]. Epitopes recognised by tau antibodies and phosphorylation sites on tau protein are shown in <Figure 3>. In 1991, Lee and collaborators purified PHF using a method comparable to that of Greenberg and Davis [<53>], and using protein chemical analysis claimed that they are made entirely of full-length hyperphosphorylated tau protein [<53>].In 1992, it was shown that, after dephosphorylation, the PHF-tau bands aligned with the recombinant tau isoform mixture, indicating that PHF-tau consists of all six tau isoforms in a hyperphosphorylated state [<46>]. These studies led to the widely quoted view that PHF are composed entirely of full-length hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This view was challenged by the Wischik group who, using another monoclonal antibody (mAb 7."
PMC4808800_3,"51), also raised against enriched proteolytically stable core PHF and recognizing all tau isoforms, showed that phosphorylated tau protein released from PHF preparations by the sarkosyl method was not quantitatively related to the total PHF-tau protein content present in these preparations, whether these were prepared with or without exogenous proteases [<54>,<55>]  Indeed the proportion of full-length, phosphorylated tau protein was found biochemically to account for less that 5% of total PHF-tau in the bulk PHF fraction prepared without protease, and less than 15% in the sarkosyl PHF preparation. Although PHF isolated without protease digestion can be immunolabeled by tau antibodies directed against phosphorylation-dependent epitopes located in the N-terminal half of the molecule, this immunoreactivity is lost after proteolytic removal of the fuzzy coat [<30>,<31>]. The fuzzy coat consists of the lengthy N-terminal portions of tau molecules that cover the surface of the filaments and are readily sensitive to proteolytic digestion. Such digestion leaves intact the proteolytically stable core structure comprising the left-handed helical or straight ribbon of repeated C-shaped subunits. In other words, the fuzzy coat comprising phosphorylated tau does not contribute to the structural core of the PHF. Core PHF have a mass of 65 kD/nm, whereas 90% of PHF isolated without proteases is 77 kD/nm, with a further 10% having a mass of 110 kD/nm [<31>]. The core PHF therefore accounts for ~85% of the mass of the filament, with a variable addition of fuzzy coat material which contributes ~12 kD/nm.The tau species identified in the 12-kD species isolated from the PHF core were found to be derived from a mixture of fragments originating from both 3- and 4-repeat isoforms, but restricted to the equivalent of three repeats in length. There are two distinct species originating from the 4R isoform of tau: the fragment derived from repeats 1, 2 and 3 and the fragment derived from repeats 2, 3 and 4. There is also a fragment derived from the 3R isoform (which lacks the second repeat), comprising the equivalent of repeats 1, 3 and 4. Since all of these fragments are restricted to the equivalent of three repeats in length, they all have identical gel mobility [<56>]. Therefore, the PHF is composed of a structural core of repeating transverse C-shaped subunits. The only tau protein found within the subunit structure is restricted to the repeat domain of the tau molecule. The contribution of phosphorylated tau is variable and restricted to the fuzzy outer coat of the PHF, accounting for approximately one in seven of the tau molecules found in the PHF [<57>]. Tau protein is most abundantly expressed in axons of central nervous system neurons [<13>] but can also be found in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and non-neural tissues [<58>]. Probably the most important role of tau protein is to promote assembly and stability of MT [<7>,<8>], although this function is complemented by other MAP (especially by MAP1B), as tau knockout mice are viable, fertile, and relatively normal, with no signs of neurodegeneration. Also, knockdown of tau with small interfering RNA does not kill primary neurons in culture or prevent axon formation [<59>]. Additionally, MAP1B is probably more important for MT stability than tau itself because knockout of MAP1B results in abnormal brain development and early death, and concurrent knockout of both MAP1B and MAPT worsens the phenotype [<60>].The most common post-translational modifications of tau proteins are phosphorylation and O-glycosylation [<61>]. Phosphorylation changes the shape of tau molecule and regulates its biological activity. Most of the phosphorylation sites are on Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro motives, but a number of sites on other residues have also been reported [<62>,<63>]. The majority of tau-based therapeutic strategies against neurodegeneration have focused on modulating tau phosphorylation, given that tau species present within NFT are hyperphosphorylated. O-glycosylation is characterized by the addition of an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on Ser or Thr residues in the vicinity of Pro residues. It is presumed that glycosylation may have a role in subcellular localization and degradation of tau proteins [<64>]. The recent discovery that tau is also modified by acetylation requires additional research to provide greater insight into the physiological and pathological consequences of tau acetylation [<65>].Tau protein can be divided into two main functional domains: the basic MT binding domain (towards the C-terminus) and the acidic projection domain (towards the N-terminus) [<66>]. The MT binding domain regulates the rate of MT polymerization through highly conserved repetitive domains R1–R4 encoded by exons 9–12 [<36>]. Adult tau isoforms with 4R (R1–R4) are about 40-fold more efficient at promoting MT assembly than the fetal isoform that is lacking exon 10 and thus having only 3R (<Figure 1>) [<67>]. The absence of expression of the R1–R2 inter-repeat region during fetal development allows for the cytoskeletal plasticity required of growing immature neurons and their elongating axons [<64>]. Apart from binding to MT, the repeat domains of tau also bind to tubulin deacetylase, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) [<68>] and apolipoprotein E (apoE, more with the ε3 than the ε4 isovariant [<69>]).The projection domain is so called because ultrastructurally it appears as a filamentous “arm” projecting from the wall of the MT. In recent years, many hitherto unknown binding partners of the projection domain have been identified. The projection domain of tau may be involved in cell signaling that occurs through the interaction with Lck, Fgr and cSrc (Src-family kinases), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), phospholipase C-γ [<70>], phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate [<71>,<72>], peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin 1, and many others (for review see [<73>]), making them potential therapeutic targets in tauopathies [<74>]. In synapses, the projection domain of tau interacts with protein kinase Fyn (plays an important role during myelination [<75>]), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) [<76>], and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). Tau knockout mice show that tau is essential for NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-dependent long-term depression [<77>,<78>,<79>]. The function of tau protein in the response to heat stress in the cell is also worth noting. When the heat stress occurs, tau protein binds to DNA and enhances DNA repair [<80>]. An additional “knot” of tau being entangled in epigenetic landscape of neurodegeneration comes from the finding that by acting as a HDAC6 inhibitor, tau is being indirectly involved in both (dys)regulation of transcriptional activity and impairment of autophagic clearance by the ubiquitin proteasome system [<81>,<82>]. The so-called “cholinergic hypothesis of AD” [<83>,<84>] dominated the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the “calcium hypothesis” in the late 1980s. After the milestone discovery that cerebrovascular amyloid and NP are composed of Aβ (as they shared the same antigenic determinants; [<85>,<86>]) in both AD and Down syndrome [<87>], and that the V717I missense “London” mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21 was found to be causally related to the early-onset autosomal-dominant familial AD [<88>], Hardy and colleagues [<89>,<90>] proposed the “amyloid cascade hypothesis”, which has become a dominant driver of AD research ever since."
PMC4808800_4,"According to the amyloid theory, excessive production of Aβ via serial cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) molecule by β-secretase (β-site APP cleaving enzyme, BACE, encoded by the BACE1 gene) and γ-secretase (multiprotein complex now known to consist minimally of four individual proteins: presenilin, nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1, APH-1, and presenilin enhancer 2, PEN-2; [<91>,<92>,<93>]), is the key pathological event which drives all other pathological changes (astrocytosis, microglial activation, neuronal death, synaptic loss, and the development of NFTs and dementia) not only in early-onset familial cases but also in late-onset, sporadic cases of AD  In 1987 Goldgaber and collaborators isolated APP and localized its gene to chromosome 21 [<94>]. It should be noted here that the first APP mutation discovered was actually the G to C mutation at codon 693 (APP E693Q) that was not associated with AD, but rather with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis—Dutch type (HCHWA-D; [<95>,<96>]). Interestingly enough, out of four other known mutations within the Aβ part of APP (exons 16 and 17) two also cause fatal hemorrhage due to amyloid angiopathy (APP C692G-Flemish and APP E693K-Italian), while only rare “Arctic” (APP E693G) and Osaka (APP E693Δ) mutations cause early-onset AD (EOAD). The well-known fact that many families exist in which AD has an early onset (before age of 60) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner [<97>] could not be explained by a very small number of AD families in which APP mutations were found. This question was resolved in part by the discovery of mutations in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1) on chromosome 14 [<98>,<99>], and its homologous presenilin 2 gene (PSEN2) on chromosome 1 [<100>,<101>]. These mutations of PSEN genes further strengthened the amyloid theory, but the pathogenesis of AD remained elusive. Further research showed that PSEN1 and PSEN2 are part of the γ-secretase complex, which cleaves APP at several points resulting in Aβ of various lengths: the lengths associated with AD are 40 and 42 amino acids long with Aβ42 more likely to aggregate to form SP in the brain than Aβ40. All PSEN mutations lead to an increase in the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio, although the total quantity of Aβ produced remains constant [<102>,<103>]. This can come about by various effects of the mutations of γ-secretase. Presenilins are also implicated in the processing of notch [<104>,<105>], an important developmental protein (mice that have PS1 knocked out die early in development from developmental abnormalities similar to those found when notch is disrupted, [<106>]). APP can also be cleaved by α-secretases such as a disintegrin and metalloproteases domain 10 (ADAM10) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) converting enzyme (TACE), although this cleavage does not result in Aβ but instead generates APPs-α, which are thought to be neuroprotective [<107>].Collectively, the genetic etiology of AD is very complex: early-onset AD (less than 5% of cases) is often familial (fAD) with autosomal dominant and fully penetrant inheritance and can be caused by any of more than 200 pathogenic mutations in APP (33 mutations, duplication), PSEN1 (185 mutations) and PSEN2 (13 mutations; http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADmutations). Most AD cases (over 95%) however are sporadic, late-onset (sAD, LOAD) and have less evident genetic components. The ε4 variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to confer increased risk for LOAD [<108>,<109>] with partial penetrance. Based on 320 meta-analyses of 1395 studies in which 695 genes and their 2973 polymorphisms have been tested as late-onset AD candidate genes, over 30 yielded positive evidence for association. The number one gene is APOE, with a Bayes factor (BF) > 50. Using APOE genotype ε3/ε3 as a neutral benchmark for comparison, individuals with a single copy of the ε4 allele manifest a 5 fold increased chance of developing LOAD, while those with two copies have an estimated 20 fold increased risk [<110>]. It seems that different APOE alleles are not associated with an increase in Aβ production, but with a reduced ability to clear Aβ from the brain [<111>,<112>]. This may be related to decreased production of Aβ auto-antibodies in AD subjects [<113>]. The next nine genes with the highest association with LOAD are: BIN1 (BF = 23.4) that encodes several isoforms of a nucleoplasmic adaptor protein, one of which was identified as MYC-interacting protein, CLU (BF = 20.1) that encodes apolipoprotein J, ABCA7 (BF = 18.8) for ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A [ABC1], member 7, CR1 (BF = 18.1) for complement component receptor 1, PICALM (BF = 17.3) for phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein, MS4A6A (BF = 8.7), CD33 (BF = 7.7) for a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage-cluster of differentiation 33, MS4A4E (BF = 6.9) coding for protein membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 4E, and CD2AP (BF = 6.6) that codes for a scaffolding molecule that regulates the actin cytoskeleton (according to www.alzgene.org accessed on 11 February 2015). Genetic variants of all of these genes have a relatively minor influence on AD progression when altered [<114>] and their influence on the development and course of sAD remains largely unknown [<115>,<116>,<117>]. Most recently, rare mutations of TREM2 [<118>] and PLD3 [<119>] have also been discovered to confer a much larger increase in risk for LOAD than the aforementioned common sequence variants [<120>]. During the 1990s, the significance of tau pathology for neurodegenerative diseases, in particular for AD, remained in the shadow of the amyloid theory. However, as the distribution pattern and overall quantity of Aβ turned out to be of limited significance for pathological staging of AD progression and symptom severity, and after detailed studies of the maturation and distribution of NFTs showing correlation with degree of cognitive decline and memory impairment in AD, Braak and Braak proposed a neuropathological staging of the gradual deposition of abnormal tau within vulnerable neurons in brain areas in the form of either NFT or neuropil threads (NT). At first they used classical silver staining [<66>] and later immunohistochemical staining for hyperphosphorylated tau using antibody AT8 [<67>]. The finding that NFT provide a better association with cognitive impairment was confirmed by other researchers [<121>,<122>], supporting a significant role for tau pathology in the disease. The Braak staging system classified the topographic progression of AD neurofibrillary degeneration into six stages, spreading from the transentorhinal region to the hippocampal formation (initial stages I and II, which clinically correlate with subjective or objective impairment of memory for recent events and mild spatial disorientation, but with preservation of general cognitive functioning with or without minimum impairment of activities of daily living), then to the temporal, frontal, and parietal neocortex (intermediate stages III and IV, which correlate with impaired recall, delayed word recall and word finding difficulties, disorientation in time and space, and impaired concentration, comprehension and conceptualization among other symptoms of dementia), and finally to unimodal and primary sensory and motor areas of the neocortex (late stages V and VI, which roughly correlate with disturbances in object recognition, and other perceptual and motor skills).Besides the fact that Braak and collaborators showed that AD-related pathology proceeds in strictly defined stages, based on the notion that NFT evolve from an accumulation of abnormal tau without PHF formation (described as the “pre-tangle” stage, [<123>]) they also proposed that abnormal phosphorylation is a crucial step leading to the formation of both soluble and insoluble tau filaments [<124>], that neuronal damage in AD actually starts many years before any clinical symptoms and signs and that, unlike Aβ, the distribution of tau pathology is associated with the clinical progression of AD."
PMC4808800_5,"In contrast to the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD, which implies that tau pathology is a secondary, downstream phenomenon, the neuropathological findings of Braak and collaborators have fueled a significant controversy concerning the importance or contributions of Aβ burden in producing damage compared to that caused by tau pathology  Additionally, in AD, the pathological Aβ and tau proteins mutually interact and are influenced by many other contributors, such as inflammatory [<125>], vascular, and environmental factors, as well as compensatory neuroplastic responses to counteract neural injury associated with neurodegenerative processes [<126>], all of which may promote cognitive and behavioral decline. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, evidence implicating tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases other than AD began to emerge. As early as 1986, Pollock and colleagues reported that the filamentous aggregates in Pick’s disease (now part of the group of disorders classes as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, FTLD, and called frontotemporal dementia, FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and AD shared the antigenic determinants of tau [<127>]. While hyperphosphorylation of tau is a feature common to all of these diseases, unlike AD, they lack significant Aβ and α-synuclein pathology. However, biochemical differences in the tau isoforms isolated from preparations of the pathological filaments in various tauopathies were observed. All six tau isoforms are present in sarkosyl extracts in equal ratios of R3 and R4 isoforms is observed in class I tauopathies, which are biochemically characterized by tau triplets of 60, 64 and 69 kDa, and additional minor bands of 72/74 kDa. Such a profile is characteristic for AD, some cases of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Niemann-Pick disease type C, Down syndrome and dementia pugilistica [<128>]. On the other side, sarkosyl extracts from the filaments of PSP [<129>], corticobasal degeneration (CBD; [<130>]), argyrophilic grain disease (AgD; [<131>]), and some cases of FTDP-17, contain tau protein that separates as doublets of 64 and 69 kDa and are predominantly composed of tau isoforms with 4R (class II tauopathies), whereas sarkosyl extracts from filaments of Pick’s disease are characterized by the presence of pathological tau doublets of 60 and 64 kDa and contain mainly 3R tau isoforms (class III tauopathy). Class IV tauopathy is represented by a single neurological disorder—myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) or Steinert’s disease, in which a major insoluble tau band of 60 kDa, and minor 64 and 69 kDa bands have been identified [<48>,<61>,<76>,<128>,<132>,<133>]. Despite the fact that these studies showed the filaments contain tau, they did not provide much direct information about the relevance of tau dysfunction and filament formation in the neurodegenerative disease process. Although tau involvement in neurodegenerative diseases other than AD attracted wide attention, genetic evidence linking dysfunction of tau protein to neurodegeneration and dementia had been missing. In 1994, Wilhelmsen and colleagues reported linkage of an autosomal dominantly inherited form of FTD with parkinsonism and amyotrophy (disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex, DDPAC) to chromosome 17q21.2, the region that contains the MAPT gene [<134>]. In 1997, Spillantini and colleagues first used the term tauopathy to describe “multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia” (MSTD), where tau filaments contain 4R isoforms in absence of 3R tau [<135>]. In parallel, Murrell and colleagues showed that the genetic defect in MSTD mapped to chromosome 17q21-22 [<136>]. At that time, 13 kindreds were considered to have sufficient evidence of linkage to be included in what was then named “frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17” (FTDP-17; [<137>]). The exclusive presence of 4R tau in the MSTD filaments naturally led to an examination of the isoform composition of the pool of soluble tau and its findings suggested that increased splicing of exon 10 of the MAPT gene might be the cause of familial MSTD. Upon DNA sequencing, a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at position +3 of the intron following exon 10 was found, which segregated with disease [<138>]. At that time, an additional eight mutations in the MAPT gene had been reported by two other groups: Poorkaj et al. reported two exonic mutations (P301L and V337M) in two families with FTDP-17 [<139>], while Hutton et al. reported six different mutations in 10 families: three of these mutations (G272V, P301L and R406W) were missense mutations in exons, while the other three were in the 5' splice site of exon 10 [<140>]. Later that year, missense mutations were shown to reduce the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly [<141>,<142>].The discovery of these and other subsequent mutations in the MAPT gene finally confirmed that molecular tau pathology can give rise to neurodegeneration in the absence of Aβ changes and that tau is in a central position as a key pathological component (leading from normal, soluble tau to abnormal, filamentous tau which causes neurodegeneration and dementia) across many neurodegenerative states and disorders, either through mutations in the MAPT gene or the effects of upstream stressors such as Aβ or oxidative damage (for review, see [<143>]). Why particular neurons are susceptible to the buildup of misfolded tau and tau aggregation remained unanswered, leading to much research activity on tau, with the development of transgenic animals and cell lines to model the effects of expressing disease-related mutations of the MAPT gene. The level of biochemical diversity and, consequently, complexity of tau pathology is perhaps best illustrated by the simple fact that specific MAPT mutations are associated with specific forms of FTD; in contrast, the very same mutation (such as TAU P301L) can apparently lead to either CBD or FTDP-17 in the same family, suggesting that other factors (genetic, epigenetic, environmental) may influence which neurons are affected and when this occurs. Several other findings have further emphasized the importance of tau in neurodegeneration (reviewed in [<144>]). A PSEN1 mutation causes a Pick’s disease phenotype including FTD tau pathology without deposition of Aβ [<145>]; some MAPT single nucleotide polymorphisms have also been linked to sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD, [<146>]); and retarded axonal extension in tau-deficient hippocampal neurons may be due to reduced MT transport by lack of tau-mediated regulation of motor protein activities [<147>]. As mentioned earlier, compelling evidence that tau malfunction or dysregulation alone can be sufficient to cause neurodegeneration came in 1998 from the identification of mutations in the MAPT gene on chromosome 17 that causes frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FTDP-17) [<140>], making cytoskeletal abnormalities a pivotal mechanism in neurodegeneration in AD (mutations in the MAPT gene cause primary tauopathies, while AD is the most important secondary tauopathy with the MAPT gene itself not being mutated) [<143>,<148>]. More specifically, abnormal phosphorylation, aggregation, and proteolysis of the tau protein in a “pre-tangle” stage of neurofibrillary degeneration (<Figure 4>) has been neuropathologically documented to be an early and crucial event in the pathogenesis of AD, but also other sporadic tauopathies, such as AgD [<131>] and PSP. Historically, NFT were considered indicators of cell death, particularly given that since 1995 they have been consistently shown to correlate well with the severity of dementia in AD, in contrast to Aβ plaque deposition does not [<122>]. However, which variety of tau is the most toxic (aggregated misfolded/fibrillar, soluble hyperphosphorylated/mislocalized, or both) and whether that toxicity represents a gain or loss of function remains an unanswered question."

Its N-terminus was defined by sequence analysis [<30>,<56>], and its C-terminus was defined by epitope mapping of MN423.

These features explained the paradox noted earlier, namely that tau protein isolated from the core of the PHF is not necessarily recognized by anti-tau antibodies (if these are directed against epitopes located in the N- or C-terminal portions of the molecule, whether or not phosphorylated), and the monoclonal antibody raised against the PHF core does not recognized normal full-length tau protein [<30>]. rhetorical Figure 4 The sequence of cytoskeletal changes due to the pathology of tau protein divided into three stages: pre-tangle (pre-NFT) stage, and intraneuronal and extraneuronal stages.

The sequential cleavage of the tau protein leads to the formation of the tau protein fragment from the microtubule-binding repeat region (see text and <Figure 4>). Tau cleavage is more likely to take place while protein is unbound to microtubules, either aggregated to itself or associated with proteins other than tubulin.

Thus, the N-termini of the tau fragments found in the proteolytically stable structural core of the PHF are located 15-residues C-terminal to the start of the repeats, and have a characteristic C-terminal truncation at position Glu391 which is 15-residues C-terminally to the end of the repeats [<151>]. These features explained the paradox noted earlier, namely that tau protein isolated from the core of the PHF is not necessarily recognized by anti-tau antibodies (if these are directed against epitopes located in the N- or C-terminal portions of the molecule, whether or not phosphorylated), and the monoclonal antibody raised against the PHF core does not recognized normal full-length tau protein [<30>].The characteristic N- and C-terminal truncations found in the core PHF-tau unit are exactly 3-repeats apart, but shifted by 15-residues with respect to the N- and C-terminal extent of the normal repeat domain. This feature was shown to represent the footprint of a pathological tau-tau binding interaction, which can occur through the repeat domain of the tau molecule and which locks it into a characteristic proteolytically stable configuration. The Glu391 trunctation could be reproduced in vitro after binding of full-length tau to a fragment terminating at Ala390 and lacking immunoreactivity to MN423 [<152>]."
PMC4808800_7,"Surprisingly, when the bound complex was taken through repeated cycles of digestion with protease and re-incubation of full-length tau, N-terminal tau immunoreactivity was eliminated in every cycle, whilst a progressive build-up of Glu391 immunoreactivity detected by MN423 was observed  Thus, the repeat domain of tau is able to catalyze and propagate the conversion of normal soluble tau into the aggregated and truncated oligomeric form in a cell-free setting.The same phenomenon has recently been demonstrated within the physiological milieu of the cell. Although the repeat domain fragment is highly toxic when expressed in cells, cells can be maintained provided expression levels remain very low, where it acts as a latent primer or seed. When such cells were co-transfected with inducible, full-length 4R tau, it was possible to induce tau aggregation and template-directed truncation of full-length tau in a controlled manner [<153>]. The neo-fragment generated in a concentration-dependent manner with respect to induced full-length tau proved to be the core tau unit itself. Thus the repeat domain has the ability to define a template-directed truncation of full-length tau to reproduce and amplify the proteolytically stable species characteristic of the PHF core in AD recruiting normal tau in the process. Importantly, the process does not require abnormal phosphorylation, or any other post-translational modification once it has been initiated. The same phenomenon has been reported independently in transgenic rat studies expressing a truncated tau species containing the repeat domain [<154>,<155>]. Insoluble tau aggregates were found to form in the brain consisting of both transgenic human truncated tau and endogenous rat tau in a 1:1 ratio. A further suprising feature in the cell-model was the demonstration that when full-length tau is induced in the presence of the truncated tau primer, it is unable to bind normally to microtubules, but instead is preferentially directed to the aggregation/truncation pathway. In contrast, full-length tau expressed in the absence of the truncated tau primer showed normal tubulin binding [<153>]. These results are consistent with that the pathological tau-tau binding affinity through the repeat domain is higher than the normal tau-tubulin binding affinity [<57>]. Thus, it is unnecessary to invoke pathological phosphorylation as a primary mechanism to account for loss of normal microtubule binding in AD. Rather, the almost complete redistribution of the tau protein pool from soluble/tubulin-bound to insoluble/aggregated that occurs in AD is simply a kinetic consequence of the properties of the pathological tau-tau binding interaction of the repeat domain.The truncated core tau unit of the PHF has also been termed “the F3 fragment” (<Figure 5>) [<156>]. The F3 fragment in the oligomeric state is resistant to cytosolic proteases and may therefore be transported unchanged to axon terminals where it may not only damage synapses, but from where it may propagate between neurons either trans-synaptically or by exosomes, thus initiating the same neurofibrillary cascade in previously healthy neurons [<157>]. As recently reviewed by Jadhav and collaborators [<76>], several factors point strongly towards a prominent role of presynaptic tau protein in mediating synaptic pathology, including (1) cognitive decline that best correlates with synaptic loss and synaptic failure; (2) synapse loss in parallel with NFT formation and occurring in the same regions in AD brains; and (3) higher NFT count associated with lower levels of presynaptic proteins in AD. In a prospective study three different synaptic protein (synaptophysin, SNAP-25 and syntaxin) were found to be progressively in neocortex at Braak stages III-VI [<158>], NFT-bearing neurons demonstrating, for example, a 35%–57% reduction in synaptophysin mRNA in AD brain [<159>]. Last but not least, synaptic deficits are observed in FTLD [<160>], PSP, and Niemann-Pick disease type C [<161>], which are all independent of any Aβ pathology. Moreover, tau proteomic changes are also confirmed in several tau transgenic models (for review, see [<76>]).Tau fragments are also able to propagate between neurons trans-synaptically, causing the spread of neurofibrillary degeneration to post-synaptic neurons [<162>]. In this case, mutations in the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes in familial AD only initially compromise endosomal-lysosomal processing and mitochondrial metabolism by altering Aβ clearance thus activating caspases responsible for tau cleavage or providing seeding factors required to nucleate pathological aggregation of tau protein through the repeat domain. Tau can be directly involved in the spread of AD pathology to neighbouring neurons. However, direct evidence for molecular mechanisms supporting this hierarchical progression (“prion-like behaviour of misprocessed tau”) has remained elusive [<163>]. The most recent data obtained indicate that tau pathology indeed may be induced and propagated after the injection of tau oligomers or aggregates in either wild-type or mutated MAPT transgenic mice [<164>], and that tau aggregates can be transferred from cell to cell in vitro [<164>,<165>] and in vivo [<166>,<167>]. These new findings suggest that suppressing the spread of tau oligomers could be a target for development of disease-modifying therapeutics for AD and other tauopathies, although further studies are needed to determine whether pathologic tau oligomers spread trans-synaptically or by exosomes. Additionally, it was proved that antibodies blocking tau aggregate seeding improve cognition in vivo [<168>]. In the case of soluble monomeric or small oligomeric tau protein, the endocytosis appears to be clathrin-dependent (reviewed in [<169>]). In contrast, larger aggregates of tau could bind heparin in the extracellular matrix and be internalized through macropinocytosis [<170>]. As a result of exocytosis and endocytosis, the spreading of tau can occur in various neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies) including AD. Three plausible mechanisms of tau spreading are shown schematically in <Figure 6>. Additionally, it appears that microglial cells may facilitate tau propagation by phagocytosis and exocytosis of tau protein [<171>]. Avila et al. (2015) have speculated on how the top six LOAD risk genes (APOE, BIN1, CLU, ABCA7, CR1 and PICALM), that all interact with tau, may be involved in the transmission of tau [<172>].In one of our previous pilot studies, we observed evidence suggesting the spreading of tau pathology in the brains of patients who suffered from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with antibodies specific for phospho-tau epitopes Ser202 and Thr205 (AT8), Ser396 (AD2) and PHF core (MN423). In early MCI, only AT8 immunoreactivity was observed in the neurons of the superficial entorhinal cortex layers and temporal isocortex. In more advanced MCI cases, we detected both AT8 and AD2 immunoreactivity in these neurons. Immunoreactivity to MN423 in layers II-III of the entorhinal and temporal isocortical neurons was observed only in advanced MCI and early AD patients. Concurrently, AT8 and AD2 immunoreactivity was found in neurons of layers II, III and V of the entorhinal cortex and AT8-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons were already present in layers III and V of the temporal isocortex. As an increase in MN423 immunoreactivity positively correlated with Braak stages, these findings support the concept of Wischik and collaborators [<157>] that cycles of proteolytic removal of N- and C-termini of tau are followed by stepwise binding of further tau in an autocatalytic process and that the repeat domain of tau is able to catalyse and propagate the conversion of normal soluble tau into accumulations of the aggregated and truncated oligomeric form. rhetorical Figure 6 Schematic representation of three different ways of anterograde spreading of tau aggregates by endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and exosomes.

The problem in identifying suitable tau aggregation inhibitors (TAI) is that most assays for tau aggregation are based on fibril formation (which require relatively high concentrations of tau, tau constructs limited to the MT binding region with the motif necessary for fibril formation, and a facilitator of aggregation, such as heparin). If compounds are selected that dissociate preformed large aggregates into smaller (still toxic) oligomers then they may be detrimental. In these assays, fibril formation is measured by a shift in fluorescence of an intercalating reporter dye binding to β-sheet structures within tau fibrils.(4) A more promising approach may be to target tau oligomers, whether these are intracellular or extracellular. Purified tau oligomer species have been demonstrated to be neurotoxic (they directly impair synaptic function and long-term potentiation, LTP) in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Extracellular tau levels measured in AD are more than four orders of magnitude lower than intracellular tau concentrations, and as such may represent a more amenable pharmacological target.(5) A quite different strategy is to target tau clearance—e.g., by rapamycin that induces macroautophagy [<175>], inhibitors of Hsp90 chaperone protein that binds to misfolded proteins or by immunotherapeutic approaches [<176>].(6) Finally, it may be possible to target tau proteolysis directly. Cellular enzymes implicated in tau proteolysis include caspases, calpains, cathepsins and a thrombin-like protease.

Disulfide-linked oligomers of tau can be observed in AD brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, and show significant fragmentation, making them great potential targets for early diagnosis of AD [<177>]. The major advantage of targeting tau proteolysis is that it may be more straightforward to inhibit an enzymatic mechanism than aggregation, provided the proteolytic activity in question can be shown to be rate-critical. It is possible that inhibition of truncation could prevent formation of aggregation-prone fragments and also trans-synaptic/exosomal spread of tau pathology.Recently, two drugs that targeted tau phosphorylation failed in phase 2 clinical trials [<178>].

These investigators stressed that hyperphosphorylation of tau may not play a critical role in aggregation of tau and formation of PHF, and that it may even have an inhibitory effect on tau-tau binding. Thus, it might be more important to clarify proteolysis of tau protein (potentially at position Glu391, although this site may simply report the C-terminal extent of the pathological binding domain) that enables the release of the C-terminal fragment. This fragment is the one that appears to be important in the formation or propagation of proteolytically stable tau oligomers that can spread to neighboring neurons trans-synaptically, further propagate tau pathology and lead ultimately to formation of PHF.

They hypothesized that tau acetylation could also promote the spreading of tau pathology (whereas in AgD it could have a protective role in this respect).The investigators are currently putting most of their efforts into basic, preclinical and clinical testing of methylene blue (MB) and its derivatives. MB is a phenothiazine that crosses the blood brain barrier and acts as a redox cycler. Moreover, besides its beneficial properties as being able to improve energy metabolism and to act as an antioxidant, it is also able to reduce tau protein aggregation. How exactly LMTX and MTC exert their neuroprotective effects in vivo is not fully understood. MB (as MTC) is able to reduce the amount of sarkosyl-insoluble tau in Drosophila that express human wild-type tau [<182>], to disaggregate PHF isolated from AD brain [<152>] and to block prion-like processing of tau protein in cell models [<153>]. Both MTC and LMTX have been shown to reduce tau pathology and reverse behavioural deficits in transgenic mouse models of established pathology based either on the repeat domain fragment or on full-length mutant tau P301S [<183>]. MB, together with its derivatives (metabolites), azure A and azure B, is able to stimulate protein degradation and inhibit oxidative damage [<184>] and also inhibit the activity of caspase-1 and caspase-3 [<185>]. MB given prior to the onset of tau aggregation was also able to prevent learning and memory deficits in tau transgenic mice [<186>], suggesting a potential preventative utility. Other possible inhibitors of tau aggregation are rhodanine-based inhibitors, phenylthiazolyl-hydrazide inhibitors, N-phenylamines, phenothiazines and benzothiazoles, and polyphenols and anthraquinones [<187>]. Although the pathogenic nature of the each type of protein deposit has been a controversial issue for many years, it is now increasingly accepted that abnormal forms of tau protein are directly involved in the initiation of neurodegerative processes. This conclusion is based primarily on the discovery that dominant missense mutations in the MAPT gene are associated with dominant, familial forms of FTD. Known polymorphisms in MAPT which confer susceptibility not only for AD and FTD, but other neurodegenerative diseases as well, together with a possible additional novel disease locus near the MAPT gene [<188>], strongly support the key role of tau protein not only in primary tauopathies but also in the pathogenesis of LOAD and other secondary tauopathies.Why disease onset takes decades before symptoms occur remains unclear at present, but current results suggest a reduced ability to clear out misfolded, oligomerized and aggregated tau proteins that increase with advancing age. As many drug discovery attempts based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis have proved unsuccessful, and due to advances in our understanding of the role for tau in AD pathogenesis [<189>], it is safe to conclude that tau protein will become an increasingly important therapeutic target for the future. The results of clinical trials with LMTX are eagerly awaited to confirm whether a treatment for tauopathies is viable. Abnormal deposition of misprocessed and aggregated proteins is a common final pathway of most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD)."
PMC4808800_10,"AD is characterized by the extraneuronal deposition of the amyloid β (Aβ) protein in the form of plaques and the intraneuronal aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in the form of filaments  Based on the biochemically diverse range of pathological tau proteins, a number of approaches have been proposed to develop new potential therapeutics. Here we discuss some of the most promising ones: inhibition of tau phosphorylation, proteolysis and aggregation, promotion of intra- and extracellular tau clearance, and stabilization of microtubules. We also emphasize the need to achieve a full understanding of the biological roles and post-translational modifications of normal tau, as well as the molecular events responsible for selective neuronal vulnerability to tau pathology and its propagation. It is concluded that answering key questions on the relationship between Aβ and tau pathology should lead to a better understanding of the nature of secondary tauopathies, especially AD, and open new therapeutic targets and strategies. ."
PMC5770880_0,"Loss of neuronal proteostasis, a common feature of the aging brain, is accelerated in neurodegenerative disorders, including different types of tauopathies. Aberrant turnover of tau, a microtubule‐stabilizing protein, contributes to its accumulation and subsequent toxicity in tauopathy patients’ brains. A direct toxic effect of pathogenic forms of tau on the proteolytic systems that normally contribute to their turnover has been proposed. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of three different types of autophagy, macroautophagy, chaperone‐mediated autophagy, and endosomal microautophagy to the degradation of tau protein variants and tau mutations associated with this age‐related disease. We have found that the pathogenic P301L mutation inhibits degradation of tau by any of the three autophagic pathways, whereas the risk‐associated tau mutation A152T reroutes tau for degradation through a different autophagy pathway. We also found defective autophagic degradation of tau when using mutations that mimic common posttranslational modifications in tau or known to promote its aggregation. Interestingly, although most mutations markedly reduced degradation of tau through autophagy, the step of this process preferentially affected varies depending on the type of tau mutation. Overall, our studies unveil a complex interplay between the multiple modifications of tau and selective forms of autophagy that may determine its physiological degradation and its faulty clearance in the disease context. It is well accepted that loss of proteostasis occurs gradually with age and underlies the basis of severe neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of frontotemporal dementia (Prahlad & Morimoto, <2009>; Voisine et al., <2010>; Morimoto & Cuervo, <2014>). Aberrant proteins are normally handled by the proteostasis networks responsible for maintaining protein quality control (Kaushik & Cuervo, <2015>). Among the proteolytic systems of these networks, autophagy or protein breakdown in lysosomes has proven effective in maintenance of a healthy proteome (Nixon, <2013>). However, numerous evidences suggest that protein variants shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders may fail to undergo degradation by autophagy and accumulate intracellularly resulting in cell toxicity and often cell death (Nixon, <2013>; Menzies et al., <2015>). Defective autophagy is sometimes a consequence of modifications on the pathogenic proteins that prevent their autophagic removal, whereas in other instances, pathogenic proteins directly impair the autophagic systems (Wong & Cuervo, <2010>).Pathogenic variants of the protein tau induce a group of neurodegenerative conditions generically known as tauopathies. Although tauopathies are caused by mutations in the same protein, tau, different types of tauopathies appear to affect different brain regions and exhibit distinct symptoms, suggesting that tau mutations may have distinctive consequences. For instance, we recently revealed that tau mutations ΔK280 and A152T influence neuronal activity in an opposite manner (Decker et al., <2016>; Dennissen et al., <2016>). We wondered whether different tau mutations may also impact tau clearance differently. Our groups and others have shown the degradation of wild‐type forms of tau through the ubiquitin/proteasome system and through autophagy and failure to degrade some mutant forms of tau through these pathways (Lee et al., <2013>; Holtzman et al., <2016>; Wang & Mandelkow, <2016>). However, the degradation pathways of different physiological tau isoforms and the effect of disease‐related point mutations and posttranslational modifications on tau degradation remain largely unknown. We have previously found that chaperone‐mediated autophagy (CMA)—a selective form of autophagy in which substrate proteins directly cross the lysosomal membrane for degradation and known to decrease with age—contributes under physiological conditions to efficient turnover of unmodified tau protein but that mutations in tau prevent its degradation by CMA (Wang et al., <2009>). These findings made us consider that other modifications of tau, including mutations associated with disease, could also impact the degradation pathways involved in their degradation and accelerate the underlying age‐dependent decrease in autophagic activity.In this work, we have systematically measured the degradation of different forms of tau by each of the three main types of autophagy described in mammals, macroautophagy, chaperone‐mediated autophagy (CMA), and endosomal microautophagy (e‐MI); and analyzed the interaction of tau proteins with the vesicular compartments that participate in each autophagic pathway and their impact on these pathways. We first compared two different mutations: P301L, known to cause autosomal‐dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Hutton et al., <1998>); and a point mutation of tau (A152T) that does not cause autosomal‐dominant disease but associates with higher risk of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Coppola et al., <2012>). Our work reveals that both mutant forms of tau become poor e‐MI substrates and that P301L mutation, in addition, markedly reduces tau's susceptibility for CMA degradation. Cells respond to expression of these mutants by upregulating macroautophagy, and to a lesser extent CMA, but this upregulation is no longer sustained when cells are challenged with additional stressors, suggesting that there is an inability of cells to handle additional stress in the presence of these tau mutants.In the second part of this study, we compared tau isoforms with different numbers of repeats (3R vs 4R) or with previously characterized mutations known to affect different tau properties to analyze the possible impact of these changes in the relation of tau with the different autophagic pathways. We included the following: (i) deletion of lysine 280 (ΔK280) (Rizzu et al., <1999>; Momeni et al., <2009>), which leads to excess of 3R transcripts (van Swieten et al., <2007>) and enhances tau aggregation into PHFs (Rizzu et al., <1999>; Barghorn et al., <2000>); (ii) mutations in cysteines 291 and 322 (C291 and C322), whose oxidation increases propensity of tau aggregation (Barghorn & Mandelkow, <2002>; Mo et al., <2009>); and (iii) mutations that mimic or disrupt phosphorylation in residues previously related to tau toxicity or aggregation propensity (Biernat & Mandelkow, <1999>). We have found that these modifications have a different impact on the degradation of tau by each of the autophagic pathways, and on the way in which they affect functioning of these autophagic pathways. Overall, our studies unveil a complex interplay between the multiple modifications of tau and selective forms of autophagy. This suggests that some of these modifications play regulatory roles in the physiological clearance of tau through these pathways, whereas others may compromise normal routes of autophagic clearance of tau and thus contribute to pathogenesis. An increase in overall tau levels has been observed in brains from patients bearing either P301L or A152T mutation on tau (Torres et al., <1998>). However, whereas the P301L mutation leads to tau aggregation into paired helical filaments (PHFs) (Barghorn et al., <2000>), patients with the risk‐associated A152T mutation display higher abundance of oligomers (Coppola et al., <2012>). To analyze whether the differences in the behavior and cellular toxicity of these two tau mutants could be in part attributable to mutation‐specific changes in tau degradation, we first measured the contribution of CMA to their clearance. We used the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro‐2a (N2a), stably expressing under the control of a tetracycline‐regulated promoter full‐length (441 residues) human tau (hTau40, which indicates tau protein with 2N and 4R domains (2N4R‐tau)) as wild‐type (WT) or with mutations A152T or P301L (Khlistunova et al., <2006>). The CMA receptor LAMP‐2A was knocked down using siRNA (Massey et al., <2006>)."
PMC5770880_1,"In agreement with our previous observations (Wang et al , <2009>), we found that lysosomes contribute to degradation of WT tau (reflected as an increase in tau levels upon blockage of lysosomal proteolysis with inhibitors). This lysosomal degradation occurred, in large part, through CMA, as genetic blockage of this pathway almost completely abolished lysosomal degradation of WT tau and led to its accumulation (Fig. <1>a,b; GAPDH is shown as an example of a well‐characterized CMA substrate (Aniento et al., <1993>) known to accumulate intracellularly upon blockage of CMA (Schneider et al., <2014>)). Tau‐A152T displayed very similar degradation dynamics, although this mutation slightly reduced tau's rates of lysosomal degradation (20% inhibition) when compared with WT tau (Fig. <1>a,b). Blockage of CMA in cells expressing tau‐A152T also resulted in significant accumulation of this variant and ablated its lysosomal degradation, suggesting preferential degradation of A152T by CMA (Fig. <1>a,b). In contrast, tau‐P301L did not significantly accumulate upon blockage of lysosomal proteolysis, indicative of minor contribution of the lysosomal system to the clearance of this mutant form of tau (Fig. <1>a,b). Interestingly, although tau‐P301L was not degraded in lysosomes, blockage of CMA promoted accumulation of this protein variant, albeit at significantly lower levels than WT and A152T. We propose that overall loss of proteostasis as a consequence of CMA blockage could indirectly affect clearance of tau‐P301L through other systems. rhetorical Figure 1 Contribution of  to degradation of disease‐related mutant tau proteins.

Differences with au40  were significant for *P < 0.05. An increase in overall tau levels has been observed in brains from patients bearing either P301L or A152T mutation on tau (Torres et al., <1998>). However, whereas the P301L mutation leads to tau aggregation into paired helical filaments (PHFs) (Barghorn et al., <2000>), patients with the risk‐associated A152T mutation display higher abundance of oligomers (Coppola et al., <2012>). To analyze whether the differences in the behavior and cellular toxicity of these two tau mutants could be in part attributable to mutation‐specific changes in tau degradation, we first measured the contribution of CMA to their clearance. We used the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro‐2a (N2a), stably expressing under the control of a tetracycline‐regulated promoter full‐length (441 residues) human tau (hTau40, which indicates tau protein with 2N and 4R domains (2N4R‐tau)) as wild‐type (WT) or with mutations A152T or P301L (Khlistunova et al., <2006>). The CMA receptor LAMP‐2A was knocked down using siRNA (Massey et al., <2006>). In agreement with our previous observations (Wang et al., <2009>), we found that lysosomes contribute to degradation of WT tau (reflected as an increase in tau levels upon blockage of lysosomal proteolysis with inhibitors). This lysosomal degradation occurred, in large part, through CMA, as genetic blockage of this pathway almost completely abolished lysosomal degradation of WT tau and led to its accumulation (Fig. <1>a,b; GAPDH is shown as an example of a well‐characterized CMA substrate (Aniento et al., <1993>) known to accumulate intracellularly upon blockage of CMA (Schneider et al., <2014>)). Tau‐A152T displayed very similar degradation dynamics, although this mutation slightly reduced tau's rates of lysosomal degradation (20% inhibition) when compared with WT tau (Fig. <1>a,b). Blockage of CMA in cells expressing tau‐A152T also resulted in significant accumulation of this variant and ablated its lysosomal degradation, suggesting preferential degradation of A152T by CMA (Fig. <1>a,b). In contrast, tau‐P301L did not significantly accumulate upon blockage of lysosomal proteolysis, indicative of minor contribution of the lysosomal system to the clearance of this mutant form of tau (Fig. <1>a,b). Interestingly, although tau‐P301L was not degraded in lysosomes, blockage of CMA promoted accumulation of this protein variant, albeit at significantly lower levels than WT and A152T. We propose that overall loss of proteostasis as a consequence of CMA blockage could indirectly affect clearance of tau‐P301L through other systems.To further elucidate the contribution of CMA to the degradation of the two mutants in the absence of any other proteolytic system, we used a well‐established in vitro system that allows to recapitulate different CMA steps (binding and translocation of substrates) using isolated intact lysosomes (Kaushik & Cuervo, <2009>). We presented lysosomes with either purified WT, A152T, or P301L tau and incubated them in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors to block tau degradation (Fig. <1>c,d). This allows determining lysosomal binding of tau as the amount of tau at the end of the incubation associated with the group of lysosomes not pretreated with protease inhibitors, as internalized tau would be rapidly degraded. Uptake of tau was calculated by the difference between the amount of tau associated with lysosomes pretreated with protease inhibitors and those not pretreated. Consistent with our previous findings (Wang et al., <2009>), WT tau is a very efficient CMA substrate, to the point that binding is almost undetectable because the protein is rapidly internalized (Fig. <1>c,d). In contrast, the P301L mutation severely impaired lysosomal uptake of tau by CMA, resulting in a sixfold decrease in degradation when compared to WT tau protein (Fig. <1>c,d). Reduced tau‐P301L uptake is not caused by a problem in translocation across the lysosomal membrane, but rather by reduced targeting/binding to lysosomes, as we did not detect tau accumulation at the lysosomal membrane. This is in clear contrast to other pathogenic proteins such as mutant α‐synuclein or mutant LRRK2 that bind to lysosomes but fail to translocate through CMA (Cuervo et al., <2004>; Orenstein et al., <2013>). In the case of tau‐A152T, the dynamics of internalization/degradation through CMA were comparable to WT tau (Fig. <1>c,d), in agreement with our studies in intact cells in culture (Fig. <1>a,b), but we found a significantly higher amount of tau‐A152T bound to the membrane of CMA‐active lysosomes (Fig. <1>c,d)."
PMC5770880_2,"To determine whether this abnormally enhanced binding was due to nonselective association of the tau mutant with membranes in general, we incubated the three proteins with lysosomes inactive for CMA (they have a very similar membrane composition to the CMA‐active pool of lysosomes, but lack hsc70 in their lumen)  As shown in Fig. <1>e, higher binding of tau‐A152T was no longer observed when using CMA‐incompetent lysosomes, thus supporting that the enhanced binding was related to CMA uptake. We propose that the higher amount of tau‐A152T bound to the lysosomal membrane at a given time may be a consequence of its slightly reduced translocation rate into the lumen when compared to WT tau (Fig. <1>c,d).Taken together, our in vitro and cell‐based studies argue that these two point mutations, A152T and P301L, reduce the normal degradation of tau by CMA, although the P301L mutation has a more pronounced inhibitory effect. Late endosomes (LE) also contribute to selective degradation of cytosolic proteins targeted to this compartment by hsc70 through a process known as endosomal microautophagy (e‐MI) (Sahu et al., <2011>; Uytterhoeven et al., <2015>). Using the same N2a cells expressing WT, A152T, and P301L tau, we analyzed changes in cellular levels of these forms of tau upon disrupting e‐MI. To that effect, we knocked down essential components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) (Sahu et al., <2011>). Contrary to WT tau, which accumulates in e‐MI‐defective cells, intracellular levels of A152T and P301L tau did not change in cells knocked down for Vps4, suggesting that both point mutations in tau compromise its ability to undergo degradation by this pathway (Fig. <2>a,b). Unexpectedly, although A152T and P301L did not accumulate in Vps4 knockdown cells upon e‐MI blockage, inhibition of lysosomal proteases did not increase their intracellular levels, suggesting that lysosomes no longer contributed to the degradation of these mutant proteins once e‐MI is compromised (Fig. <2>a,b). It is possible that nonlysosomal proteolysis or extracellular release of tau is activated in response to the e‐MI blockage to prevent its cellular accumulation. rhetorical Figure 2 Endosomal microautophagy and macroautophagy of disease‐related mutant tau proteins.

Late endosomes (LE) also contribute to selective degradation of cytosolic proteins targeted to this compartment by hsc70 through a process known as endosomal microautophagy (e‐MI) (Sahu et al., <2011>; Uytterhoeven et al., <2015>). Using the same N2a cells expressing WT, A152T, and P301L tau, we analyzed changes in cellular levels of these forms of tau upon disrupting e‐MI. To that effect, we knocked down essential components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) (Sahu et al., <2011>). Contrary to WT tau, which accumulates in e‐MI‐defective cells, intracellular levels of A152T and P301L tau did not change in cells knocked down for Vps4, suggesting that both point mutations in tau compromise its ability to undergo degradation by this pathway (Fig. <2>a,b). Unexpectedly, although A152T and P301L did not accumulate in Vps4 knockdown cells upon e‐MI blockage, inhibition of lysosomal proteases did not increase their intracellular levels, suggesting that lysosomes no longer contributed to the degradation of these mutant proteins once e‐MI is compromised (Fig. <2>a,b). It is possible that nonlysosomal proteolysis or extracellular release of tau is activated in response to the e‐MI blockage to prevent its cellular accumulation.To understand whether failure to undergo e‐MI was due to LE toxicity in these cells or a primary defect in tau targeting and degradation, we presented purified tau proteins (WT, A152T, or P301L) to intact LE previously incubated or not with protease inhibitors. We found that WT tau was taken up and efficiently degraded by LE (Fig. <2>c,d). This process was significantly impaired for tau‐P301L and, to higher extent, for tau‐A152T (Fig. <2>c,d). Exposure of these purified mutant proteins to disrupted LE shows no difference in their degradation rates compared to WT tau (Fig. <S1>, Supporting information), suggesting that defective e‐MI occurs at the level of internalization of mutant tau proteins inside LE. These findings suggest that e‐MI can effectively internalize and degrade unmodified forms of tau, but mutations in this protein greatly reduce the ability of LE to contribute to its turnover.Lastly, to determine the contribution of macroautophagy to the degradation of mutant forms of tau, we silenced Atg7 in the N2a cells expressing the different tau proteins. Macroautophagy blockage resulted in preferential accumulation of A152T, but not WT and P301L tau (Fig. <2>e,f). As in the case of cells with compromised e‐MI, although disruption of macroautophagy did not result in accumulation of WT or P301L tau, their rates of lysosomal degradation were markedly reduced. This supports a possible engagement of other clearance mechanism(s) in response to the blockage of macroautophagy.Overall, these results suggest a switch in the autophagic degradation of tau proteins bearing these pathogenic mutations (Fig. <2>g). Thus, the A152T mutation blocks degradation of tau in LE, favors its rerouting toward macroautophagy degradation, and has only a mild effect on its degradation by CMA. In contrast, the P301L mutation is the one more severely affecting tau degradation by lysosomes as, in agreement with its insensitivity to blockage of overall lysosomal proteolysis, we failed to detect significant contribution of CMA, e‐MI, or macroautophagy to its cellular clearance (Fig. <2>g). Pathogenic tau variants can negatively impact the activity of different proteolytic systems. To determine whether the observed changes in autophagic clearance of A152T and P301L tau could be in part a consequence of their toxic effect on these pathways, we analyzed the effect of these mutant proteins on overall protein degradation. We measured proteolysis of long‐lived proteins (preferentially degraded by autophagy) in N2a cells treated with doxycycline to activate expression of the different tau proteins and labeled with [3H] leucine for 48 h. Measurements were carried out under basal (Serum +) and inducible conditions (Serum −)."
PMC5770880_3,"Cells expressing tau‐A152T displayed significantly higher rates of intracellular protein degradation than the other cells under basal conditions (Fig  <3>a). A similar significant increase in protein degradation was observed in response to serum removal in cells expressing either of the mutants (Fig. <3>b). These changes suggest an initial cellular response to the expression of these mutant proteins, whereby cells upregulate intracellular proteolysis likely to sustain proteostasis and facilitate removal of the toxic proteins. rhetorical Figure 3 Effect of disease‐related mutant tau proteins on .

These changes suggest an initial cellular response to the expression of these mutant proteins, whereby cells upregulate intracellular proteolysis likely to sustain proteostasis and facilitate removal of the toxic proteins.To identify the impact of the tau mutants on each of the autophagic pathways, we first used a photoswitchable reporter for CMA (generated by fusion of the fluorescent protein Dendra with a CMA‐targeting motif (KFERQ‐like), KFERQ‐Dendra (Koga et al., <2011>)). This fluorescent protein changes its localization from the cytosol into lysosomes when CMA is active, shifting from a diffuse fluorescent cytosolic pattern to a punctate pattern (Fig. <S2>, Supporting information shows colocalization of single‐color fluorescent CMA reporter (KFERQ‐PA‐mCherry) puncta with a lysosomal marker to confirm proper targeting of the probe to lysosomes in these cells). The number of fluorescent puncta in cells expressing tau‐A152T remained unchanged under basal conditions (Fig. <3>c,e), suggesting that CMA was likely not responsible for the protein degradation burst in these cells. We did however find that under serum deprivation conditions, tau‐A152T‐expressing cells displayed significantly higher CMA (Fig. <3>d,e; 30% increase) than control cells. Cells expressing tau‐P301L displayed significant upregulation of CMA under basal conditions that was no longer observed upon serum removal (Fig. <3>c–e). Overall, these findings suggest that cells react to pathogenic tau by increasing their basal or inducible CMA activity. However, at least in the presence of tau‐P301L, the further increase in CMA normally induced by nutrient deprivation is no longer attainable.To explore the possibility that pathogenic forms of tau may limit the ability of cells to upregulate CMA in response to stress, we exposed cells expressing the CMA reporter and tau proteins to increasing concentrations of paraquat (to induce oxidative stress) or to thapsigargin (to induce ER stress). Cells expressing WT tau behave as control cells and display a dose‐dependent increase in CMA activity upon exposure to paraquat (Fig. <3>f) or thapsigargin (Fig. <3>g). However, cells expressing the mutant tau proteins failed to further upregulate CMA and even a decrease was noticeable in cells expressing tau‐P301L (Fig. <3>f,g). These results support a general inability of the cells to upregulate their CMA activity to handle additional stress in the presence of A152T or P301L tau. This inability to accommodate the autophagic response to the stressor may contribute to the higher sensitivity to both paraquat and thapsigargin that we observed in cells expressing either of the two mutant proteins (Fig. <S3>, Supporting information).Our in vitro study revealed that despite lack of internalization/degradation, a fraction of the mutant tau proteins still associated with the membrane of LE (Fig. <2>c). Therefore, we next analyzed possible changes in e‐MI activity in these cells using a reporter developed to study this pathway in flies and modified by our laboratory for use in mammalian cells (Uytterhoeven et al., <2015>). We transduced cells with the split mVenus plasmid containing the N‐terminal and C‐terminal of this protein tagged to the KFERQ motif (N‐KFERQ‐mVenus and C‐KFERQ‐mVenus). Fluorescence is only observed when these two constructs are in very close proximity within the multivesicular bodies that form during e‐MI. Any hemi‐KFERQ‐mVenus targeted to lysosomes would not fluoresce as it will be unfolded and rapidly degraded. As expected, fluorescence puncta were visible in transduced control cells (Fig. <4>a) and blockage of endo/lysosomal degradation with ammonium chloride and leupeptin significantly increased the number of fluorescent puncta by preventing their degradation (Fig. <4>b). In the presence of any of the tau proteins, we found some sequestration of the probe in the multivesicular bodies, albeit significantly less in cells expressing the WT and A152T protein. However, the probe content did not increase upon treatment with protease inhibitors, suggesting that its internalization/degradation through this pathway was halted (Fig. <4>b,c). It is possible that inhibition of e‐MI by WT tau is due to competition of tau with other substrates for this pathway, including the probe. However, a direct inhibitory effect of tau bound to the LE membrane is a more likely scenario in the case of the mutant proteins, as none of them undergo detectable degradation through e‐MI but still associate with LE membranes (Fig. <2>c). rhetorical Figure 4 Effect of disease‐related mutant tau proteins on different autophagic pathways.

The number of fluorescent puncta in cells expressing tau‐A152T remained unchanged under basal conditions (Fig. <3>c,e), suggesting that CMA was likely not responsible for the protein degradation burst in these cells. We did however find that under serum deprivation conditions, tau‐A152T‐expressing cells displayed significantly higher CMA (Fig. <3>d,e; 30% increase) than control cells. Cells expressing tau‐P301L displayed significant upregulation of CMA under basal conditions that was no longer observed upon serum removal (Fig. <3>c–e). Overall, these findings suggest that cells react to pathogenic tau by increasing their basal or inducible CMA activity. However, at least in the presence of tau‐P301L, the further increase in CMA normally induced by nutrient deprivation is no longer attainable.To explore the possibility that pathogenic forms of tau may limit the ability of cells to upregulate CMA in response to stress, we exposed cells expressing the CMA reporter and tau proteins to increasing concentrations of paraquat (to induce oxidative stress) or to thapsigargin (to induce ER stress). Cells expressing WT tau behave as control cells and display a dose‐dependent increase in CMA activity upon exposure to paraquat (Fig. <3>f) or thapsigargin (Fig. <3>g). However, cells expressing the mutant tau proteins failed to further upregulate CMA and even a decrease was noticeable in cells expressing tau‐P301L (Fig. <3>f,g). These results support a general inability of the cells to upregulate their CMA activity to handle additional stress in the presence of A152T or P301L tau. This inability to accommodate the autophagic response to the stressor may contribute to the higher sensitivity to both paraquat and thapsigargin that we observed in cells expressing either of the two mutant proteins (Fig. <S3>, Supporting information).Our in vitro study revealed that despite lack of internalization/degradation, a fraction of the mutant tau proteins still associated with the membrane of LE (Fig. <2>c). Therefore, we next analyzed possible changes in e‐MI activity in these cells using a reporter developed to study this pathway in flies and modified by our laboratory for use in mammalian cells (Uytterhoeven et al., <2015>). We transduced cells with the split mVenus plasmid containing the N‐terminal and C‐terminal of this protein tagged to the KFERQ motif (N‐KFERQ‐mVenus and C‐KFERQ‐mVenus). Fluorescence is only observed when these two constructs are in very close proximity within the multivesicular bodies that form during e‐MI. Any hemi‐KFERQ‐mVenus targeted to lysosomes would not fluoresce as it will be unfolded and rapidly degraded. As expected, fluorescence puncta were visible in transduced control cells (Fig. <4>a) and blockage of endo/lysosomal degradation with ammonium chloride and leupeptin significantly increased the number of fluorescent puncta by preventing their degradation (Fig. <4>b). In the presence of any of the tau proteins, we found some sequestration of the probe in the multivesicular bodies, albeit significantly less in cells expressing the WT and A152T protein. However, the probe content did not increase upon treatment with protease inhibitors, suggesting that its internalization/degradation through this pathway was halted (Fig. <4>b,c). It is possible that inhibition of e‐MI by WT tau is due to competition of tau with other substrates for this pathway, including the probe. However, a direct inhibitory effect of tau bound to the LE membrane is a more likely scenario in the case of the mutant proteins, as none of them undergo detectable degradation through e‐MI but still associate with LE membranes (Fig. <2>c).Lastly, to understand whether either of these point mutations of tau modifies MA activity, we monitored MA by transducing cells with a well‐characterized component of autophagosomes (Kabeya et al., <2000>), the light chain 3 protein (LC3) fused to mCherry and GFP. The tandem mCherry‐GFP‐LC3 reporter (Kimura et al., <2007>) allows to measure autophagosomes and autolysosomes (as yellow and red puncta, respectively). This is because the fluorescence of GFP is quenched once it reaches the acidic environment of the lysosomal lumen and, thereby, only red fluorescence is observed. We found that abundance of autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes + autolysosomes) significantly increased in cells expressing either of the two tau mutants (Fig. <4>d,e). This increase was mainly due to higher content of autolysosomes (red puncta) (Fig. <4>d,e), in support of increased macroautophagic flux. To discard possible cell‐type‐dependent effects, we transiently transfected a second line of neuronal‐like cells (SH‐SY5Y) with the different tau mutants and confirmed a similar increase in macroautophagy flux using immunoblot for LC3‐II in cells treated or not with lysosomal protease inhibitors (Fig. <S4>, Supporting information). The significantly higher abundance of autophagic vacuoles was still evident in cells expressing the two tau mutants when serum was removed from the culture media, suggesting that macroautophagy is still upregulated under these conditions (Fig. <4>f,g). However, in this case, a significant increase in autophagosomes and a reduction in autolysosomes become evident when compared to basal conditions. This could be indicative of some incipient saturation of the lysosomal system for autophagosome clearance. Although tau‐P301L is not primarily degraded by macroautophagy, the observed increase in the macroautophagy flux may be a cellular response to this pathogenic form of tau."
PMC5770880_5,"In fact, increased macroautophagy may be responsible for the increase in the degradation of long‐lived proteins that we observed for both mutant forms of tau under these conditions (Fig  <3>b). As both CMA and macroautophagy are stress‐induced forms of autophagy, we also analyzed changes in macroautophagy in cells expressing WT, A152T, and P301L subjected to additional stressors. As in the case of CMA, the presence of the pathogenic proteins limited the ability of macroautophagy to become upregulated upon oxidative or ER stress (Fig. <S5>, Supporting information).In summary, when comparing the pathogenic tau mutation P301L with the risk‐associated mutation A152T, we found that both reduced normal turnover of tau by autophagy, but that the effect of the P301L mutation was more pronounced (summarized in Fig. <2>g and Fig. <S6>, Supporting information). The most notable difference between the two tau mutants was the inability of P301L to undergo degradation by CMA or by macroautophagy. Conversely, cells reacted to the presence of both mutant proteins by upregulating basal protein degradation, mainly through macroautophagy, but this constant activation seems to limit any further upregulation to accommodate to additional stress thus increasing their vulnerability to stressors. Our previous studies and data presented in this work support substantial contribution of CMA to the degradation of wild‐type unmodified tau (Wang et al., <2009>). Interestingly, although judging by the studies in intact cells the contribution of e‐MI to tau degradation is small (Fig. <2>a), our in vitro studies with isolated LE revealed a high efficiency for e‐MI of tau (Fig. <2>c). This suggests that in some cellular conditions or upon specific tau modifications, this could become an effective way for tau degradation. To further explore modifications in tau that may impact its degradation by CMA and e‐MI, we next analyzed the degradation of different tau isoforms and tau mutations that change its biochemical properties (e.g., aggregation, oxidation, or pseudophosphorylation).We used four tau isoforms with different number of N and R domain: 2N4R tau (referred to as hTau40 in the rest of the study), 2N3R tau, 1N3R tau, and 0N3R tau (Fig. <5>a). Analysis of their uptake by isolated CMA‐active lysosomes revealed that 2N3R tau behaved similarly to 2N4R tau (which we have used in the rest of the study as control). This supports that the second R domain has little impact on CMA of tau (Fig. <5>b,c). Absence of the second N‐terminal insert (in 1N3R tau) did not reduce CMA of tau, but instead this isoform displayed faster internalization (lower binding because of more efficient uptake) (Fig. <5>b,c). In contrast, once the first N‐terminal insert is lost (in 0N3R tau), we observed a very pronounced decrease in tau uptake (Fig. <5>b,c). As in the case of A152T, the enhanced binding of 0N3R tau to lysosomes did not result from nonselective interaction with membranes, because we did not observe binding of 0N3R tau to CMA‐inactive lysosomes (Fig. <5>d). These results suggest that the second N‐terminal insert plays a crucial role in the uptake of tau into the lysosomal lumen, but it is not required for hsc70 binding and lysosomal targeting of tau. These findings are consistent with the fact that the KFERQ‐like motifs in tau are in the C‐terminal domain. Absence of the second N‐terminal insert also significantly reduced e‐MI of tau (Fig. <5>e,f). rhetorical Figure 5 Degradation of different tau isoforms by selective autophagic pathways.

We did not detect enhanced binding of this tau mutant to CMA‐active or CMA‐inactive lysosomes (Fig. <6>a–c).

Although the tendency of hTau40 ΔK280 to aggregate could be the determinant of its poor clearance by CMA, we propose a direct effect of this mutation on tau's ability to undergo degradation through CMA, as inefficient CMA of hTau40 ΔK280 seems, in part, independent of aggregation. Thus, insertion of two prolines in the ΔK280 background (hTau40 ΔK280/2P), which prevents tau aggregation (Barghorn & Mandelkow, <2002>), only partially rescued CMA uptake of the ΔK280 mutant (Fig. <6>a,b)."

We did not detect differences with WT tau on binding or uptake by lysosomes of the hTau40 C291A/C322A mutant that renders the protein unable of becoming oxidized thus reducing its aggregation propensity (Mukrasch et al., <2009>) (Fig. <7>a,b). This lack of effect could be due to the fact that incubation was not performed under pro‐oxidizing conditions, when disulfide bonds could form between cysteines.

Previous studies have demonstrated that oxidized proteins accumulate inside multivesicular bodies (Cannizzo et al., <2012>), suggesting that oxidation may be a prerequisite to complete internalization of tau by e‐MI, and that the LE environment may contribute to that modification. rhetorical Figure 7 Effect of oxidation and pseudophosphorylation on the degradation of tau by selective autophagic pathways.

Previous studies have demonstrated that oxidized proteins accumulate inside multivesicular bodies (Cannizzo et al., <2012>), suggesting that oxidation may be a prerequisite to complete internalization of tau by e‐MI, and that the LE environment may contribute to that modification.Phosphorylation has been extensively studied in the context of tau pathology (Mandelkow et al., <1995>; Wang & Mandelkow, <2016>), but due to the multiplicity of phosphorylation sites in the protein, the site‐specific impact of phosphorylation on tau biology is not well understood. We chose to analyze the effect of mutations that mimic phosphorylation at specific residues that form part of the epitopes of antibodies elevated in AD or for which an aggregation propensity has been described (Biernat & Mandelkow, <1999>; Chang et al., <2011>; Combs et al., <2011>; Kiris et al., <2011>; Prokopovich et al., <2017>, 50). We used S to E mutations that mimic phosphorylation in the KXGS motifs of the repeat domain that controls microtubule binding and tau aggregation rate (Fischer et al., <2009>). Exchanging S262, S293, S324, and S356 for E (hTau40 4xKXGE) was used to generate the pseudophosphorylated tau, while the 4xKXGA mutant was used as a nonphosphorylatable control. The second pseudophosphorylation form of tau selected for this study was htau40 AT8/AT100/PHF‐1. The nomenclature is based on the phospho‐epitopes recognized by antibodies raised against tau from AD brains (AT8, AT100, or PHF‐1) when tau is phosphorylated at specific sites at either flanking domain of the repeats (Bibow et al., <2011>). The two pseudophosphorylated tau proteins (hTau40 AT8/AT100/PHF‐1 and hTau40 4xKXGE) displayed significantly decreased lysosomal uptake when compared to hTau40 WT Tau (Fig. <7>a,b). Interestingly, the step of CMA affected in each pseudophosphorylation mutant seemed different. In the case of hTau40 AT8/AT100/PHF‐1, defective lysosomal uptake originates mostly from inefficient binding of this protein to lysosomes. However, in the case of hTau40 4xKXGE, which leads to a more severe CMA defect, binding to the lysosomal membrane still occurred, but translocation was severely impaired (Fig. <7>a,b). Nonselective binding to membranes of CMA‐incompetent lysosomes was not detected for any of these proteins (Fig. <7>c). Changing glutamic acid for alanine (hTau40 4xKXGA), which serves as a control for the pseudophosphorylation, partially rescued the uptake of this form of tau (Fig. <7>a,b). Analysis of e‐MI of the pseudophosphorylated forms of tau using LE showed reduced uptake/degradation of hTau40 AT8/AT100/PHF‐1 when compared to WT tau (Fig. <7>d,e)."
PMC5770880_8,"This effect was more pronounced in the case of hTau40 4xKXGE, whose uptake and degradation by LE was completely abolished (Fig  <7>d,e), suggesting that phosphorylation in the microtubule‐binding domain diminishes its degradation by e‐MI. As in the case of CMA, only partial rescue was observed in the hTau40 4xKXGA mutant (Fig. <7>d,e). This argues that changes, other than phosphorylation, in that region may have a disruptive effect on the selective sequestration of tau by LE.Overall, these studies have identified modifications in tau with a negative impact on its degradation by different autophagic pathways and have discriminated which forms of tau exert a toxic effect on its own degradation systems. A summary of the changes in CMA and e‐MI of the different tau variants is provided in Fig. <7> (Supporting information) and a schematic of the steps affected in these pathways in Fig. <7>f,g. In this work, we found that modifications in the amino acid sequence of tau affect its normal degradation through CMA and e‐MI and that in turn, some of these modifications can have an impact on the activity of these degradation pathways (summarized in Figs <2>g and <7>f,g and <Figs S6> and <S7>, Supporting information). Understanding differences in this dual interplay between different forms of tau and the autophagic pathways may help to discover why some tau modifications contribute to pathogenicity while others only increase disease risk (Wang & Mandelkow, <2016>). Similarly, in light of the extensive repertoire of posttranslational modifications already described for this protein (Prokopovich et al., <2017>), a systematic analysis of the impact of these modifications on different aspects of tau biology, including its turnover by selective forms of autophagy as investigated in this study, should help to clarify the physiological regulation of tau and the basis of its toxicity in the aging brain.The P301L tau mutation lies within the repeated domain and enhances tau aggregation, and its role in FTD pathogenesis has been well characterized. By contrast, the A152T mutation lies far outside the repeat domain and has only a weak effect on tau aggregation, and its role as a risk factor in FTD spectrum disorders or AD is still poorly understood. The different effects of both mutations have been further demonstrated by comparing the phenotype of P301L (Lin et al., <2003>) and the novel tau‐A152T transgenic mouse models (Decker et al., <2016>; Maeda et al., <2016>; Sydow et al., <2016>). However, the basis for these phenotypic differences is not fully understood. In this work, we have found that the P301L mutation interferes with the degradation of tau through all the autophagic pathways. In contrast, the A152T mutation on tau disrupts its degradation by e‐MI but has a considerably less pronounced impact on the degradation of this protein by CMA, which is one of the preferred pathways for tau degradation under physiological conditions (summarized in Fig. <S6>, Supporting information). The different impact of both mutations in the autophagic degradation of tau goes in line with the severity of tau toxicity in the mouse models expressing copies of these proteins (Lin et al., <2003>; Decker et al., <2016>; Maeda et al., <2016>; Sydow et al., <2016>). Pathology and tau aggregation in mouse expressing the Tau‐A152T mutation occur at a slower pace than in the tau‐P301L overexpressor, where tangles appear as early as 4.5 month (Lin et al., <2003>) and where we found a more severe impairment of its autophagic degradation.Interestingly, the marked increase in degradation of Tau‐A152T by macroautophagy (which we propose to be compensatory to its reduced degradation by CMA) was not observed for the P301L‐tau mutant. This failure to reroute P301L‐tau to macroautophagy was not due to a toxic effect of the pathogenic protein on macroautophagy, as we found that expression of this mutation induces an increase in macroautophagy flux. This suggests that cells in the presence of this toxic protein try to compensate and increase their degradation capacity. Whether the failure to degrade P301L through macroautophagy, despite the upregulation of this system, is the result of problems in the recognition/targeting of this mutant protein toward this pathway requires future investigation. However, independently of the mechanism, the upregulation of macroautophagy did not increase P301L‐tau degradation by this pathway nor did it reduce the cytotoxicity of this protein. This poses possible limitations to the therapeutic value of mere upregulation of macroautophagy in this context. In contrast, the effective degradation of the A152T mutant by macroautophagy (which we attribute to its reduced degradation via CMA) suggests that modulation of macroautophagy may be a suitable alternative to reduce intracellular abundance of Tau‐A152T protein.We found that e‐MI did not contribute to degradation of either tau‐A152T or tau‐P301L, and that neither protein could be targeted to LE for degradation, not even in vitro. This is interesting because we initially attributed the lack of intracellular accumulation of tau‐P301L, despite its inability to undergo degradation by any of the autophagic pathways, to possible release of tau‐P301L from the cell. In this respect, we considered that tau‐P301L could be released upon delivery to LE, from where it could be secreted into exosomes. However, intracellular levels of tau‐P301L are not affected by disruption of multivesicular body/exosome formation. It is possible that instead of our proposed release of tau‐P301L via LE and exosomes, other systems contribute to tau‐P301L secretion or that other proteolytic systems (i.e., the ubiquitin/proteasome system) contribute to its breakdown.In our experimental setting, the observed reduction in CMA activity and basal upregulation of macroautophagy in cells expressing the mutant proteins does not seem due to changes in lysosomal biogenesis because the number of endo/lysosomal compartments (positive for LAMP1) remained unchanged. However, we cannot discard that once in a more chronic setting, indirect effect of mutant tau proteins on lysosomal biogenesis may also occur. Despite this basal compensation between CMA and macroautophagy, the fact that cells expressing either of the tau mutant proteins fail to further upregulate these autophagic pathways in response to additional stressors suggests that they might be functioning at the limit and could be close to exhaustion. This effect may be more pronounced in cells expressing P301L‐tau which had consistently higher basal upregulation of macroautophagy. This inability to adapt the autophagic response to stressors would be particularly worrisome in the context of a chronic disease in the aging brain where a failure of autophagy might trigger faster disease progression. In fact, defective macroautophagy has been extensively reported in FTD and other tauopathies (Nixon, <2013>).Targeting of proteins for degradation by CMA and e‐MI requires a pentapeptide motif recognized by the hsc70 chaperone (Sahu et al., <2011>; Kaushik & Cuervo, <2012>). Tau bears two of such motifs in its C‐terminal region which are required for its CMA targeting (Wang et al., <2009>). The comparative analysis presented here with four different tau isoforms supports that in addition to this targeting motif, the N‐terminal inserts are crucial for the degradation of tau through CMA, and to a lesser extent through e‐MI. While the KFERQ‐like motif in the C‐terminal domain is required for targeting, the internalization step of both CMA and e‐MI step is disrupted when the N‐terminal insert is missing. It is still unclear how this domain facilitates internalization of tau, as our previous data suggested a ‘C‐terminus first’ entry through CMA (Wang et al., <2009>). It is possible that interaction of the N‐terminal insert with components of the lysosomal membrane contributes to stabilize tau during the internalization process. In fact, according to the ‘paperclip model’ (based on FRET pairs) (Jeganathan et al., <2006>), the N‐ and C‐termini come into close vicinity."
PMC5770880_9,"The two phosphomimetic forms of tau tested in this study (mimicking phosphorylation sites within the repeats or in the flanking regions) display defects in their CMA and e‐MI degradation  This suggests that, despite the known limitations of the use of amino acids as phosphorylation mimetics, posttranslational modifications in these tau residues could have a similar negative impact on tau degradation through these two selective forms of autophagy. Notably, the steps of CMA and e‐MI affected by tau phosphorylation are different depending on the phosphorylated regions. When tau is phosphorylated within the microtubule‐binding domain (KXGS motifs), binding to lysosomes occurs, but translocation is disrupted. By contrast, hyperphosphorylation in the flanking domains (AT8 or PHF‐1 epitopes) severely reduces the binding of tau to lysosomes (summarized in Fig. <S7>, Supporting information). Intriguingly, the effects on e‐MI of both types of phosphorylated tau were opposite: phosphorylation in the microtubule‐binding site reduced LE binding whereas phosphorylation outside this region did not interfere with binding but disrupted internalization. Furthermore, reverting the pseudophosphorylation within the microtubule‐binding domain partially rescued lysosomal uptake of tau, but had a negligible effect on its impaired e‐MI degradation. These findings make appealing the idea that under physiological conditions phosphorylation could be a signal for the triage of tau between CMA and e‐MI. It is plausible that phosphorylation at certain sites can reduce the ability of hsc70 to bind to tau and deliver it to these autophagic compartments. Further analysis of the interaction of hsc70 and its different co‐chaperones with phosphorylated tau should help to elucidate how targeting occurs in those cases in which only internalization or translocation of the phosphorylated proteins is blocked.The in vitro systems with isolated lysosomes and late endosomes have allowed us to directly analyze the impact of the mutations and modifications on the degradation through those compartments, without worrying about additional modifications that could occur when tau is in the cellular context or about the indirect contribution of other proteolytic systems. Combination of in vitro and cultured cells studies, as we did for the two FTD‐related mutants, will be required in the future for the other modifications to better understand the consequences of their failure to undergo degradation by these selective pathways. We have selected N2a cells as experimental model to start understanding the complex interplay of tau proteins with autophagic pathways. Studies from our laboratories and others, with pathogenic proteins such as alpha‐synuclein, support that the mechanism of their toxic effect on autophagy is the same independent of the cell type (Cuervo et al., <2004>). However, future studies in transgenic mouse models expressing these tau variants are needed to confirm whether the toxic effect of P301L‐tau and A152T‐tau on autophagy that we describe here in N2a cells also occurs in these mouse neurons.Overall, our studies unveil a complex interplay between the multiple modifications of tau and selective forms of autophagy, suggesting that some of these modifications may play regulatory roles in the physiological clearance of tau through these pathways whereas others interfere with normal mechanisms for tau clearance. Understanding these differences between physiological and toxic modifications of tau and the effect of these modified forms of tau in the normal functioning of different forms of autophagy will be key for future development of therapeutic strategies aiming at reducing tau toxicity by modulating its autophagic clearance. Adult male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were used for subcellular fractionation under institutional approved animal protocols. Where indicated, rats were starved for 48 h to activate CMA. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro‐2a (N2a) was generated as described before (Khlistunova et al., <2006>). Cells stably knocked down for LAMP‐2A, Atg7 were generated as described previously (Massey et al., <2006>) using lentiviral‐delivered small hairpin RNA (shRNA). Cells stably knocked down for Vps4A/B were generated by similar procedures but using the following shRNA from the Mission‐Sigma library (Sigma‐Aldrich, San Luis, MO, USA) VPS4A (TRCN0000101417) and VPS4B (TRCN0000101821). Transient knockdown was performed with RNA interference (RNAi) by transfecting cells with 10 nm of the RNAi duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in Opti‐MEM media without antibiotics. Efficiency of protein knockdown was tested at 24‐ and 48‐h time intervals post‐transfection by immunoblot analysis. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma), in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μg mL−1 penicillin, and 50 μg mL−1 streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Sources of reagents and chemicals were as described before (Kiffin et al., <2004>; Massey et al., <2006>; Bandyopadhyay et al., <2010>). The antibody against mouse LAMP‐2A was developed in our laboratory (Cuervo & Dice, <1996>). The antibody against total tau (DA9) was a gift from Dr. P. Davies (The Feinstein Institute, Manhasset, NY, USA). The antibody against Vps4 was from Sigma, against GAPDH from Abcam, against light chain 3 protein (LC3) and Atg7 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA), against actin from Stressgen, and against hsc70 from Novus. Lysosomes with high activity for CMA were isolated from rat liver by centrifugation of a light mitochondrial–lysosomal fraction in a discontinuous metrizamide density gradient by the modified method described previously (Cuervo et al., <1997>). Isolation of late endosomes was performed by centrifugation of a mitochondrial–lysosomal–endosomal fraction in two consecutive continuous Percoll gradients laid over a 2.5 m sucrose cushion using a modified method described before (Castellino & Germain, <1995>). To measure degradation of long‐lived proteins, confluent cells were labeled with 3H‐leucine (2 μCi mL−1) for 48 h at 37 °C, transfected with the indicated plasmids, and then extensively washed and afterward maintained in complete (10% FBS) or serum‐deprived media containing an excess of unlabeled leucine (2.8 mm) to prevent reutilization of radiolabeled leucine (Kaushik & Cuervo, <2009>). Aliquots of the media taken at different times were precipitated with TCA and proteolysis was measured as the percentage of the initial acid‐insoluble radioactivity (protein) transformed into acid‐soluble radioactivity (amino acids and small peptides) at the end of the incubation. Total radioactivity incorporated into cellular proteins was determined as the amount of acid‐precipitable radioactivity in labeled cells immediately after washing. Recombinant Tau proteins were prepared as described previously (Barghorn et al., <2005>). Tau constructs were obtained in expression vector pNG2 (a derivative of pET‐3a (Merck‐Novagen, Kenilworth, NJ, USA)). Recombinant proteins were expressed in the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Merck‐Novagen) and purified using the heat stability of Tau protein and by FPLC SP‐Sepharose (GE Healthcare Little Chalfont, UK). The cell pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm MES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm DTT, pH 6.8) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell, boiled for 20 min and after centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against two changes of cation exchange chromatography buffer A (20 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 6.8) and loaded on a FPLC SP‐Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of cation exchange chromatography buffer B (20 mm MES, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 6.8). The eluate was exchanged to PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4) via dialysis."
PMC5770880_10,"The purity of proteins was ascertained by SDS‐PAGE  Where necessary, breakdown products were removed using the additional gel filtration column Superdex G75 with PBS buffer. In the experimental construct used in our study, all these residues were exchanged for E to generate the pseudophosphorylated protein hTau40 AT8/AT100/PHF‐1 (Zheng‐Fischhofer et al., <1998>)—in the case of AT8 S199, S202, and T205 (Biernat et al., <1992>), for AT100 it is T212 and S214 and for PHF‐1 it is S396 and S404. CMA activity in vitro was measured using isolated intact lysosomes incubated with purified proteins at 37 °C in an isosmotic media (20 mm MOPS pH 7.3, 0.25 m sucrose) for 20 min. At the end of the incubation, lysosomes were collected by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblot (Kaushik & Cuervo, <2009>). Binding was calculated as the amount of substrate protein bound to the lysosomal membrane in the absence of protease inhibitors and uptake by subtracting the amount of protein associated with lysosomes in the presence (protein bound to the lysosomal membrane and taken up by lysosomes) and absence (protein bound to the lysosomal membrane) of protease inhibitors. Where indicated, lysosomes with lower CMA activity were used in the incubation to determine nonselective binding of the purified proteins to cellular membranes. CMA activity in intact cells was measured using lentivirus‐mediated expression of the KFERQ‐PS‐Dendra2 and high‐content microscopy (Koga et al., <2011>). Cells were plated in 96‐well plate and photoactivated with a 405‐nm light‐emitting diode (LED; Norlux) for 4 min with the intensity of 3.5 mA (current constant). After 16 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and images were captured with a high‐content microscope (Operetta system, Perkin Elmer) and quantification was performed with the manufacturer's software in a minimum of 800 cells (approx. nine fields). e‐MI activity in vitro was measured using isolated late endosomes incubated with purified proteins and subjected to immunoblot (Sahu et al., <2011>). Binding and internalization were calculated as the amount of substrate protein bound to the late endosomal membrane and intact internal vesicles in the absence of protease inhibitors and luminal degradation by subtracting the amount of protein associated with late endosomes in the presence (protein bound to the endosomal membrane, intact internal vesicles and inside late endosomal lumen) and absence (protein bound to the endosomal membrane and intact internal vesicles) of protease inhibitors.
e‐MI activity in intact cells was measured using lentivirus‐mediated expression of the KFERQ‐N‐split Venus and KFERQ‐C‐split Venus and high‐content microscopy (Koga et al., <2011>). Cells transduced with lentivirus carrying those two parts of split Venus, were plated in 96‐well plates and incubated in complete media supplemented or not with 20 mm NH4Cl/100 μm leupeptin (N/L) for 12 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and images were captured with a high‐content microscope (Operetta system, Perkin Elmer). Quantification was performed with the manufacturer's software in a minimum of 800 cells (approx. nine fields) by measuring number of fluorescent puncta per cell in untreated cells (substrate binding/internalization by e‐MI). The increase in number of puncta upon addition of N/L corresponds to the amount of substrate degraded by e‐MI. Macroautophagy was measured in intact cells transduced with the mCherry‐GFP‐LC3 tandem reporter (Klionsky et al., <2016>). Cells stably transduced with lentivirus carrying this reporter were plated in 96‐well plate and incubated in serum‐supplemented complete media or in serum‐deprived media for 12 h. Where indicated, increasing concentrations of paraquat (PQ) or thapsigargin (TG) were added 6 h after plating. All wells were fixed and imaged in the Operetta system as described in previous sections. The total number of autophagic vacuoles per cell was calculated by quantification of the number of red puncta in cells, the number of autophagosomes as the green puncta per cell, and autophagic flux as the number of only red (autolysosomes) puncta per cell. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Lowry et al., <1951>). Cells were solubilized on ice with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X‐100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2). Cellular viability was measured in cells plated in 96‐well flat‐bottom plates using the CellTiter Blue cell viability assay reagent (Promega) as changes in the fluorescence (excitation 540 nm, emission 590 nm) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence intensity values were normalized to values of untreated wells. Immunoblotting was performed after transferring SDS‐PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Towbin et al., <1979>). The proteins of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence using peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies in LAS‐3000 Imaging System (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Densitometric quantification of the immunoblotted membranes was performed using ImageJ (NIH). When using total cellular protein lysates, actin was used for normalization purposes as contribution of autophagic pathways to its degradation is minimal. A decrease in the relative contribution of actin to the same amount of total cell lysate protein is indicative of accumulation of other proteins. For the studies of isolation of lysosomes and cell fractionation, the number of animals for preparation was determined based on the average values of enrichment and recovery of endogenous markers for each compartment. All numerical results are reported as mean + s.e.m., and represent data from a minimum of three independent experiments unless otherwise stated. We determined the statistical significance of the difference between experimental groups in instances of single comparisons by the two‐tailed unpaired Student's t‐test with the Sigma Plot software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA, USA). In instances of multiple means comparisons, we used one‐way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test to determine statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed in all the assays, and significant differences are noted in the graphical representations.

[Correction added on 20 October 2017, after first online publication: The authors' contributions section has been updated in this current version.] The authors declare no conflict of interest. Loss of neuronal proteostasis, a common feature of the aging brain, is accelerated in neurodegenerative disorders, including different types of tauopathies. Aberrant turnover of tau, a microtubule‐stabilizing protein, contributes to its accumulation and subsequent toxicity in tauopathy patients’ brains. A direct toxic effect of pathogenic forms of tau on the proteolytic systems that normally contribute to their turnover has been proposed. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of three different types of autophagy, macroautophagy, chaperone‐mediated autophagy, and endosomal microautophagy to the degradation of tau protein variants and tau mutations associated with this age‐related disease."
PMC5770880_11,"We have found that the pathogenic P301L mutation inhibits degradation of tau by any of the three autophagic pathways, whereas the risk‐associated tau mutation A152T reroutes tau for degradation through a different autophagy pathway  We also found defective autophagic degradation of tau when using mutations that mimic common posttranslational modifications in tau or known to promote its aggregation. Interestingly, although most mutations markedly reduced degradation of tau through autophagy, the step of this process preferentially affected varies depending on the type of tau mutation. Overall, our studies unveil a complex interplay between the multiple modifications of tau and selective forms of autophagy that may determine its physiological degradation and its faulty clearance in the disease context. ."
PMC6260915_0,"Tau protein accumulation is the most common pathology among degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and over twenty others. Tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation is the closest correlate with cognitive decline and cell loss (Arriagada, Growdon, Hedley‐Whyte, & Hyman, <1992>), yet mechanisms mediating tau toxicity are poorly understood. NFT formation does not induce apoptosis (de Calignon, Spires‐Jones, Pitstick, Carlson, & Hyman, 2009), which suggests that secondary mechanisms are driving toxicity. Transcriptomic analyses of NFT‐containing neurons microdissected from postmortem AD brain revealed an expression profile consistent with cellular senescence. This complex stress response induces aberrant cell cycle activity, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, and metabolic dysfunction. Using four AD transgenic mouse models, we found that NFTs, but not Aβ plaques, display a senescence‐like phenotype. Cdkn2a transcript level, a hallmark measure of senescence, directly correlated with brain atrophy and NFT burden in mice. This relationship extended to postmortem brain tissue from humans with PSP to indicate a phenomenon common to tau toxicity. Tau transgenic mice with late‐stage pathology were treated with senolytics to remove senescent cells. Despite the advanced age and disease progression, MRI brain imaging and histopathological analyses indicated a reduction in total NFT density, neuron loss, and ventricular enlargement. Collectively, these findings indicate a strong association between the presence of NFTs and cellular senescence in the brain, which contributes to neurodegeneration. Given the prevalence of tau protein deposition among neurodegenerative diseases, these findings have broad implications for understanding, and potentially treating, dozens of brain diseases.

The underlying processes driving chronic neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders are largely unknown, and disease‐modifying treatments remain elusive. The accumulation of tau protein is the most common pathology among these diseases making tau an appealing molecular target for intervention (Orr, Sullivan, & Frost, <2017>). Tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) closely track with disease severity in human AD (Arriagada, Growdon, Hedley‐Whyte, & Hyman, <1992>); however, NFT‐containing neurons are long‐lived and do not induce immediate cell death (de Calignon, Spires‐Jones, Pitstick, Carlson, & Hyman, <2009>). In silico modeling predicts that NFT‐containing neurons may survive decades (Morsch, Simon, & Coleman, <1999>), which suggests that non‐cell autonomous mechanisms may contribute to NFT‐associated toxicity.The experimental data from various studies indicate that tau pathology may be associated with cellular senescence. This complex stress response induces a near permanent cell cycle arrest, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, metabolic dysfunction, and disruption of surrounding tissue due to the secretion of toxic molecules (Childs et al., <2016>). While many of these features have been described in AD brains and transgenic animal models throughout the literature (e.g., aberrant cell cycle activity, p16INK4A co‐localization with NFTs (Arendt, Rodel, Gartner, & Holzer, <1996>), decreased lamin B1, and heterochromatin relaxation (Frost, Bardai, & Feany, <2016>); a role for cellular senescence in AD‐associated neurodegeneration has not been investigated. We hypothesized that tau accumulation may activate this stress response and thereby initiate a chronic degenerative process culminating in neuron loss and brain dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we examined human brain tissue with NFT pathology and utilized AD transgenic mouse models that develop tau‐associated pathologies. Also, we employed methods to genetically reduce NFTs and pharmacologically clear senescent cells. Our results indicate that NFTs induce cellular senescence in transgenic mice and postmortem human brain tissue. We also found that senolytics decreased cortical NFT burden, brain atrophy, and neuron loss in an advanced age (20 months old) transgenic mouse model of tau‐associated neurodegeneration. We queried the publicly available GEO Profiles database (Barrett et al., <2013>) for gene sets specific to NFTs. We evaluated laser capture‐microdissected cortical neurons containing NFTs from AD brains (GEO accession GDS2795) and compared them to adjacent histopathologically normal neurons for a within‐subject study design (Dunckley et al., <2006>). NFT‐containing neurons upregulated genes involved in cell survival and viability, inflammation, cell cycle progression and molecular transport and downregulated apoptosis, necrosis, and cell death pathways (Figure <1>a). NFκB, a pro‐survival master transcriptional regulator of inflammation, was the highest predicted upstream regulator of the NFT gene expression profile. In agreement with inflammatory activation, other predicted upstream regulators included IFNG, TNF, TLR4, IL1B, and CXCL1 (Figure <1>b). Collectively, the molecular pathways identified in the NFT analyses resembled cellular senescence. rhetorical Figure 1 Neurofibrillary tangles were associated with cellular senescence‐associated gene pathways in human Alzheimer’s disease neurons and tau transgenic mouse brains.

In agreement with inflammatory activation, other predicted upstream regulators included IFNG, TNF, TLR4, IL1B, and CXCL1 (Figure <1>b). Collectively, the molecular pathways identified in the NFT analyses resembled cellular senescence. We used the rTg(tauP301L)4510 transgenic mouse line, hereon referred to as “tauNFT” to investigate a link between NFT formation and a senescence‐like phenomenon in neurodegeneration. These mice develop well‐characterized, aggressive, tau pathology in forebrain regions concomitant with neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits (Santacruz et al., <2005>; pathology illustrated in Supporting Information Figure <S1>). Mice that overexpress wild‐type human tau, “tauWT,” express the same level of transgenic human tau protein as tauNFT, but acquire age‐dependent tau pathogenesis at a much slower rate and are used to identify effects of elevated pre‐pathogenic tau (Hoover et al., <2010>; Supporting Information Figures <S1> and <S2>); age‐matched tauNFT littermate mice without human tau overexpression serve as wild‐type controls, “CTL”. To determine whether NFT‐containing neurons in mice induced a gene expression profile resembling cellular senescence, we assessed hippocampal gene expression patterns in tauNFT mice before (~2 months old) and after (~6 months old) NFT formation (GSE56772). Consistent with NFTs from human AD, mouse NFTs also caused significant activation scores for IFNG, TNF, and IL‐1B, as well as enrichment in other senescence‐associated JAK, STAT, CDKN2A, and BCL2 predicted upstream regulators (Figure <1>c) indicating translational relevance for using tauNFT mice to explore our hypothesis. Senescence‐inducing stressors often inflict DNA damage that drives production of the SASP (Rodier et al., <2009>). TauNFT mouse brains displayed significantly elevated histone γ‐H2ax, a sensitive marker of both double‐stranded DNA breaks and cellular senescence (Sedelnikova et al., <2004>; p = 0.0056; Figure <1>d–e). The cell cycle protein p21, encoded by Cdkn1a, is upregulated in many senescent cell types and has been associated with DNA damage during neuronal aging (Jurk et al., <2012>). Similarly, elevated expression of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor 2a, Cdkn2a, is one of the most robust markers of cellular senescence, and its protein product, p16INK4A, colocalizes with NFTs in human AD (Arendt et al., <1996>). Because anti‐p21 and anti‐p16INK4A antibodies are notoriously poor in mouse tissue, we exclusively measured Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a gene expression. TauNFT brains expressed three‐fold higher Cdkn1a than control mice (p = 0.0178, Figure <1>f), which was replicated in a separate mouse cohort (p = 0.0086, Supporting Information Figure <S2>f). Moreover, Cdkn2a was expressed at levels 2.7‐ and 2.6‐fold higher in tauNFT than CTL and tauWT, respectively (p = 0.0303 and p = 0.0352, respectively; Figure <1>g); this effect was replicated in an independent mouse cohort (p = 0.0016, Supporting Information Figure <S2>g).Senescent cells exert chronic tissue degeneration through secretion of toxic SASP (Coppe et al., <2010>). Consistent with the transcriptomic profile in human NFT‐bearing neurons and mouse brain tissue (Figure <1>a‐c), SASP genes were found to be upregulated in tauNFT brains, that is, Il1b was four‐ and twofold higher than CTL and tauWT, respectively; and Cxcl1 was fourfold higher than both control genotypes; Tnfa was 13‐ and eightfold higher than CTL and tauWT, respectively; Tlr4 was threefold higher than both control genotypes (Figure <2>a‐d). Further gene expression analyses allowed us to define an array specific to tau pathology in tauNFT brains (Supporting Information Figure <S2>e). NFκB regulates the pro‐survival, pro‐inflammatory SASP gene expression profile characteristic of cellular senescence (Salminen & Kaarniranta, <2011>). Consistent with NFκB pathway activation and the SASP profile, nuclear‐localized NFκB p65 was significantly increased in tauNFT brains (Figure <2>e‐f). In all measures, tauWT mice were not significantly different from CTL. These results suggest that insoluble tau and/or post‐translational modifications associated with insoluble tau, but not general tau overexpression, were responsible for the senescence‐associated profile (i.e., DNA damage, NFκB activation, and upregulated SASP; Figures <1>, <2> and Supporting Information Figure <S2>). rhetorical Figure 2 Neurofibrillary tangles were associated with upregulation of SASP gene expression and NFκB activation.

Because anti‐p21 and anti‐p16INK4A antibodies are notoriously poor in mouse tissue, we exclusively measured Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a gene expression. TauNFT brains expressed three‐fold higher Cdkn1a than control mice (p = 0.0178, Figure <1>f), which was replicated in a separate mouse cohort (p = 0.0086, Supporting Information Figure <S2>f). Moreover, Cdkn2a was expressed at levels 2.7‐ and 2.6‐fold higher in tauNFT than CTL and tauWT, respectively (p = 0."
PMC6260915_2,"0303 and p = 0 0352, respectively; Figure <1>g); this effect was replicated in an independent mouse cohort (p = 0.0016, Supporting Information Figure <S2>g).Senescent cells exert chronic tissue degeneration through secretion of toxic SASP (Coppe et al., <2010>). Consistent with the transcriptomic profile in human NFT‐bearing neurons and mouse brain tissue (Figure <1>a‐c), SASP genes were found to be upregulated in tauNFT brains, that is, Il1b was four‐ and twofold higher than CTL and tauWT, respectively; and Cxcl1 was fourfold higher than both control genotypes; Tnfa was 13‐ and eightfold higher than CTL and tauWT, respectively; Tlr4 was threefold higher than both control genotypes (Figure <2>a‐d). Further gene expression analyses allowed us to define an array specific to tau pathology in tauNFT brains (Supporting Information Figure <S2>e). NFκB regulates the pro‐survival, pro‐inflammatory SASP gene expression profile characteristic of cellular senescence (Salminen & Kaarniranta, <2011>). Consistent with NFκB pathway activation and the SASP profile, nuclear‐localized NFκB p65 was significantly increased in tauNFT brains (Figure <2>e‐f). In all measures, tauWT mice were not significantly different from CTL. These results suggest that insoluble tau and/or post‐translational modifications associated with insoluble tau, but not general tau overexpression, were responsible for the senescence‐associated profile (i.e., DNA damage, NFκB activation, and upregulated SASP; Figures <1>, <2> and Supporting Information Figure <S2>). In regenerative tissues and in vitro cultures, senescent cells may exhibit SA β‐gal activity, which is a measure of lysosomal galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 and indicative of altered/expanded lysosomal compartments (Severino, Allen, Balin, Balin, & Cristofalo, <2000>). The examination of the gene that codes for the hydrolase enzyme, galactosidase beta (β) 1 (Glb1), revealed that tauNFT mice expressed higher Glb1 gene expression than controls (Supporting Information Figure <S3>). However, staining for β‐gal hydrolase activity at pH 6.0 revealed fewer positive cells than controls. Furthermore, SA β‐gal‐reactive cells were observed even in very young mice (1 month old) and the number of SA β‐gal‐reactive cells was positively correlated with brain mass (R
2 = 0.4852, p = 0.0039 Supporting Information Figure <S3>). While our results indicate that SA β‐gal reactivity did not correlate with other senescence markers or brain atrophy, the observed increase in Glb1 gene expression along with a decrease in lysosomal activity at pH 6.0, compared to controls, is suggestive of tau‐associated lysosomal defects, which have been reported by others (Caballero et al., <2018>; Wang, Martinez‐Vicente, et al., <2009>). Mitochondrial dysfunction is obligatory for SASP production and cellular senescence (Correia‐Melo et al., <2016>; Hutter et al., <2004>). To examine mitochondrial bioenergetics, we performed high‐resolution respirometry to yield accurate quantitative measurements of oxidative phosphorylation in response to specific substrates for complex I, complex II, fat oxidation, and electron‐transfer system (ETS) capacity. Across genotypes, we compared cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. This allowed for the evaluation of specific differences in oxygen consumption due to elevated transgenic tau (comparing CTL with tauwt and tauNFT), pathogenic tau‐specific effects (comparing tauwt to tauNFT), as well as the interaction among brains regions and tau expression (e.g., cortex and hippocampus express transgenic tau and develop NFTs, but cerebellum does not). We found a significant genotype main effect for oxygen flux in both cortex and hippocampus, indicating that global respiratory capacity was impaired in NFT‐containing brain regions (p < 0.0001; Figure <3>), an effect primarily driven by CI + CII respiration coupled to ATP production (cortex: p = 0.0034; hippocampus: p = 0.0215; Figure <3>g,h, respectively), and uncoupled or maximum respiratory capacity (cortex: p = 0.0248; hippocampus: p = 0.0261; Figure <3>g,h, respectively). These changes were different between tauNFT and each of the control mouse lines, CTL, and tauWT mice. Because tauWT and tauNFT mice express comparable total tau levels, alterations to respiratory capacity cannot be attributed to tau overexpression. Citrate synthase activity is a surrogate marker of total mitochondrial content/mass and was similar across genotypes and brain regions (Figure <3>i) suggesting that the defects in cellular respiration were due to altered mitochondrial quality and not content/mass. Moreover, tauNFT cerebellum did not show deficits in cellular respiration or Cdkn2a upregulation (Figure <3>j,k), indicating that senescence‐associated mitochondrial dysfunction was present only in brain regions with persistent pathogenic tau expression. rhetorical Figure 3 Brain regions with neurofibrillary tangles displayed altered cellular respiration.

Reducing NFT load in age‐matched animals is not feasible; once NFTs form, they cannot be therapeutically eliminated. However, genetically ablating endogenous mouse tau (microtubule‐associated protein tau, Mapt) reduces NFT pathology and neurodegeneration in tauNFT mice (tauNFT‐Mapt0/0; Wegmann et al., <2015>). The reduced tau pathology corresponded with 60% lower Cdkn2a expression (p = 0.0041, Figure <4>a), decreased SASP (Supporting Information Figure <S4>), and decreased brain atrophy (tauNFT‐Mapt0/0: 0.4058 ± 0.009 vs. age‐matched tauNFT‐Maptwt/wt: 0.3451 ± 0.0116; 17.5% difference, p = 0.0143, Figure <4>b). TauNFT mice develop aggressive tauopathy with NFT formation in early life and show a senescence‐associated transcriptomic profile with NFT onset (Figure <1>c).

These results provide additional evidence for the association between NFT formation and senescence‐associated Cdkn2a upregulation. rhetorical Figure 4 Senescence‐associated Cdkn2a was significantly upregulated in mouse and human brains with neurofibrillary tangles and tracked with total tangle deposition and brain atrophy. (a) Genetically ablating endogenous mouse tau to significantly reduce neurofibrillary tangle load resulted in a concomitant 60% reduction in Cdk2na expression (two‐tailed t test: p = 0.0041; n = 3/group) and (b) significant reduction in brain atrophy (two‐tailed t test, p = 0.0143; n = 3/group).

These results provide additional evidence for the association between NFT formation and senescence‐associated Cdkn2a upregulation. To determine whether Cdkn2a expression was driven specifically by NFTs, or whether AD‐associated Aβ protein deposition also increased Cdkn2a, we utilized 3xTgAD mice that acquire both AD‐associated pathologies with Aβ deposition and NFT onset at 6 and 18 months of age, respectively (Oddo et al., <2003>). In 15‐month‐old mice with heavy Aβ deposition and phosphorylated tau, but lacking NFT pathology (Orr, Salinas, Buffenstein, & Oddo, <2014>), Cdkn2a expression was not elevated (Figure <4>e). These data indicate that Cdkn2a expression was neither a response to general protein accumulation, nor to pre‐NFT tau pathology, but instead required the presence of NFTs. Further, when plotted against brain weight, Cdkn2a expression was a strong predictor of brain atrophy across mouse lines (p < 0.0001, R
2 = 0.5615; Figure <4>f). Tau pathology is common among >20 brain diseases. To investigate whether the findings in human AD neurons and transgenic mice translated to human brains with pure tauopathy (i.e., NFT pathology without other protein aggregates such as Aβ), we acquired human brain tissue with histopathologically confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; Table <1> for patient characteristics). PSP is an age‐associated tauopathy that clinically manifests as parkinsonism with additional motor abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction (Orr et al., <2017>) and is neuropathologically defined by the accumulation of four‐repeat (4R) tau, NFTs, gliosis, and neurodegeneration (Flament, Delacourte, Verny, Hauw, & Javoy‐Agid, <1991>). Consistent with the results from transgenic mice, CDKN2A was upregulated in PSP brains (p = 0.0415, Figure <4>g) and expression correlated with NFT deposition, specifically in the parietal lobe (ANOVA, p = 0.0008; Kendall's Tau rank correlation, p = 0.059, Figure <4>h). Moreover, one individual with the worst cognitive performance, Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 12, displayed the highest level of CDKN2A expression, and high molecular weight tau (Figure <4>i). Collectively, these findings led us to conclude that NFTs were directly linked to senescence‐associated Cdkn2a upregulation, which in turn was a strong predictor of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

Senescent cells comprise a small proportion of total cellular makeup within a tissue (~15%; Herbig, Ferreira, Condel, Carey, & Sedivy, <2006>). Nonetheless, genetically (Baker et al., <2011>) or pharmacologically (Zhu et al., <2015>) clearing even a small percentage of these cells improves health span and delays age‐associated diseases (Kirkland et al., <2017>). We used some of the best characterized senolytics to date, dasatinib and quercetin (DQ), to determine the utility of targeting cellular senescence to treat tau‐associated neurodegeneration in late life. Beginning at 20 months old, tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 and nontransgenic Mapt0/0 mice were randomized to receive vehicle or DQ at biweekly intervals for 3 months. When mice were 23 months old, brain structure and cerebral blood flow were analyzed with MRI and postmortem histopathology (Figure <5> and Supporting Information Figure <S5>). Consistent with senescent cell removal, intermittent DQ treatment significantly reduced the number of NFT‐containing cortical neurons (p < 0.0001, 35% reduction; Figure <5>a,b). Relative to the existing neuronal population at this advanced age, gene expression of the NFT‐associated senescence gene array was reduced by DQ (p = 0.0006; Supporting Information Figure <S6>a). Among these genes, those highly sensitive to NFT‐dependent upregulation (Supporting Information Figure <S2>) were most affected (i.e., Tlr4: p = 0.0459 and Cxcl1: p = 0.0142; Figure <5>c; Supporting Information Figure <S6>a).

The absence of a full rescue of ventricular enlargement to that of control animals was not completely unexpected considering the severity of disease and age of the animals when treatment was initiated.Aberrant cerebral blood flow is a functional defect that occurs in AD and tauNFT mice and is closely associated with cognitive impairment (Wells et al., <2015>). In brain tissue with tau pathology, cerebral blood flow was elevated in tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 vehicle‐treated mice (21% whole brain, p = 0.045; cortex, 48.7%, p = 0.051, Supporting Information Figure <S5>b,c) and consistent with previous reports of tauNFT mice on a Mapt+/+background (Wells et al., <2015>)."
PMC6260915_5,"DQ improved aberrant cerebral blood flow in tauNFT‐Mapt0/0 mice such that cerebral blood flow was no longer statistically different from controls (Supporting Information Figure <S5>b,c)  Overall, a composite analysis of DQ treatment in tauNFT mice revealed a significant global benefit on cerebral blood flow and neurodegeneration (p = 0.0138; Supporting Information Figure <S5>d).To elucidate whether the DQ‐dependent reduction in NFT burden, SASP expression, and improvements to brain structure and cerebral blood flow conferred neuroprotection, we measured levels of cell type‐specific protein expression in the brain. DQ‐treated mice expressed significantly higher levels of neuronal proteins (NeuN: 25%, synaptophysin: 40.8%; PSD95: 38.5%; p < 0.05; Figure <5>f–i). The astrocyte protein GFAP was unchanged, while microglia Iba1 expression was elevated (Iba1: 40%, p = 0.0013; Supporting Information Figure <S6>b–d) suggesting that DQ‐mediated neuroprotection and decreased SASP were not derived from a reduction in pro‐inflammatory glia (astrocytes or microglia) but instead associated with fewer NFT‐containing neurons. Moreover, DQ did not alter total human tau protein levels indicating the effects were not driven by changes in tau protein expression, but rather insoluble NFTs or associated post‐translational modifications (Supporting Information Figure <S7>). Collectively, our data suggest that cyclic senescent cell removal of NFTs with DQ produced long‐lasting global effects on brain, as evidenced by histopathology and MRI analyses. The inability to effectively treat tau‐associated diseases arises, in part, from a limited understanding of processes driving neurodegeneration during the prodromal period. We have identified cellular senescence, the quintessence of latent tissue degeneration, as a cellular mechanism upregulated in tau‐associated neurodegeneration. Findings in NFT‐developing transgenic mice, postmortem human AD, and PSP brain tissue support this concept.Cellular senescence is an elaborate stress response that varies across tissues and even among cell types within tissues. Our experimental data provide an initial report of features consistent with cellular senescence in the brain (i.e., transcriptomics, upregulated Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, SASP molecules, and altered cellular bioenergetics). A complete depiction of tau‐associated cellular senescence will require several follow‐up studies guided by these results and a close evaluation of already published data. For example, aberrant HMGB1 (Nilson et al., <2017>), loss of lamin B and heterochromatin relaxation (Frost et al., <2016>), and altered cellular morphology (Orr, Pitstick, Canine, Ashe, & Carlson, <2012>) are all associated with tau pathology, and consistent with cellular senescence.Tau processing is complex and requires tight regulation to maintain neuronal viability. Alterations to tau splice variant expression, post‐translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, conformational changes, oligomerization, and cleavage), subcellular localization, etc. may result in neuronal dysfunction. As such, pathogenic tau is observed in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases where its histopathological characterization aids in clinical diagnoses. Our experimental results have revealed a strong association between NFT pathology and a senescence‐like phenotype. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other tau species and/or specific post‐translational modifications may also contribute to cellular senescence. The upstream mediators driving tau‐associated cellular senescence in AD and PSP also remain unknown; however, it is tempting to speculate that tau‐induced cell cycle re‐entry may be involved (Arendt, <2012>). Aberrant cell cycle re‐entry causes neuronal apoptosis and AD‐associated pathology (Park, Hallows, Chakrabarty, Davies, & Vincent, <2007>) and requires soluble tau (Seward et al., <2013>). The observed increase in NFT‐associated Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a gene expression may allow stressed neurons to abort cell cycle re‐entry and enter a cellular state similar to cellular senescence. In this way, NFTs formed in early pathogenic stages due to acute stress may initially protect neurons from cell death, but then contribute to neurodegeneration later in life through senescence‐like mechanisms by altering the bioenergetic state of the brain and upregulating the toxic SASP.Pathogenic tau induces a traditional neuroinflammatory response by activating microglia and astrocytes (for recent review Laurent, Buee, & Blum, <2018>). Our data suggest that NFT‐containing neurons may be active participants in perpetuating the inflammatory response as well. Future studies are required to better understand the contribution of SASP to the overall neuroinflammation phenotype common among many brain diseases. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that therapeutically targeting cellular senescence effectively interrupted a chronic neurodegenerative cascade to decrease NFT‐associated pathology and improve brain structure and aberrant cerebral blood flow even in the presence of established tau pathology in a late‐life advanced disease state. Overall, our data provide evidence that cellular senescence may be an underlying pathogenic process common among tauopathies, which opens a new field of investigative research and offers a potential druggable target to treat the >20 tau‐associated neurodegenerative diseases.

We used 16‐ to 32‐month‐old male and female rTg4510 and rTg21221 mice that reversibly express P301L mutant human tau or wild‐type human tau 4R02, respectively, on either a wild‐type or Mapt knockout Bl6/FVB genetic background (Hoover et al., <2010>; Santacruz et al., <2005>; Wegmann et al., <2015>). Nontransgene expressing littermates from rTg4510 and rTg21221 are used as controls; since no differences were found between these control lines, only littermates from rTg4510 are used here (Supporting Information Figure <S1>f–i). The mice were bred by Rose Pitstick and George A. Carlson at McLaughlin Research Institute, Great Falls, MT. Mouse euthanasia, brain dissection, and preparation were performed as previously described (Orr et al., <2012>, <2014> ). The GEO accessions GDS2795 and GSE56772 were accessed from the GEO Profiles database (Barrett et al., <2013>; Dunckley et al., <2006>) with Rstudio version 1.0.143. Because the GDS2795 data set was a within‐subject design, ratios of NFT vs. CTL gene expression were generated for each subject. Mean ratios of each gene from GDS2795 and fold change values from GSE56772 were uploaded into Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA) software (IPA, QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis). For GDS2795, GenBank Accession IDs were used and 34,910 out of 54,675 genes were identified by IPA software. The expression fold change cutoff value was set at 3 (both down‐ and upregulated) compressing the analyses to 3,048 genes. For GSE56772, LIMMA package was used to determine the fold change and p‐values. The p‐value cutoff for IPA analysis was set at p < 0.01 yielding 1,294 transcripts, 738 down‐ and 556 upregulated. We utilized IPA causal analytic tools (Kramer, Green, Pollard, & Tugendreich, <2014>) to elucidate predicted upstream regulators, as well as disease and biological functions with significant z‐scores enriched in our data set.Findings from GDS2795 were replicated with more stringent criteria (p < 0.05 for NFT/CTL ratios with no fold change limit) allowing for 1715 genes to be uploaded into IPA with similar results. Similarly, these findings were replicated a third time using the LIMMA package, the most common method for microarray analysis. This method did not take into account within‐subject design. Using a p < 0.05, 1,219 differentially regulated genes were uploaded for IPA analyses; the results were similar to the original findings."
PMC6260915_6,"Furthermore, results from GSE56772 were replicated using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with default setting and similar results were obtained  Frozen forebrain and cerebellum were powdered in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from ~25 mg of each respective brain (or brain region) using the RNAqueous 4PCR® kit (Ambion), following the manufacturer protocol including the 15‐min DNase treatment. qPCR was performed on 25 ng RNA using the TaqMan® RNA‐to‐CT™ 1‐step kit. All gene expression analyses were made using TaqMan gene expression assays. RNA polymerase II subunit J (Polr2j) expression was used as an internal control for both mouse and human gene expression assays, Mm00448649_m1 and Hs01558819_m1, respectively. TaqMan genes expression identifiers for target genes are as follows: mouse and human Cdkn2a: Mm00494449_m1 and Hs00923894_m1, respectively; other mouse genes: Cdkn1a: Mm00432448_m1; Glb1: Mm01259108_m1; Cxcl1: Mm04207460_m1; Tlr4: Rn00569848_m1; Il1β: Mm00434228_m1; and TNF: Mm00443258_m1. The senescent cell population comprises a small proportion of all cells in a tissue; therefore, SASP gene expression values were normalized to neuronal Mapt, Mm00521988_m1; Mm00521992_m1 the senescence‐susceptible neuronal population. qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System, with SDS software version 2.3. Cycle profile was performed using the kit manufacturer protocol. Approximately 50 mg frozen forebrain was used for subcellular fractionation and capillary electrophoresis as previously described (Orr et al., <2014>; Orr, Garbarino, Salinas, & Buffenstein, <2015>). Briefly, frozen tissue was powdered in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized with dounce and pestle and fractionated following manufacturer protocol (Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentrations were determined with BCA (Bio‐Rad); 2 µg protein was used for capillary electrophoresis. Antibodies were diluted in Wes Antibody Diluent to the final working concentrations: p65, 1:50 (Cell Signaling, D14E12; Beverly, MA); phospho‐Ser139 H2A.X, 1:50 (Cell Signaling, 20E3); HT7, 1:1,000 (Pierce/Invitrogen); NeuN, 1:50 (Millipore, MAB377; Temecula, CA, USA): GFAP 1:200 (Cell Signaling, D1F4Q); synaptophysin, 1:50 (Cell Signaling, D35E4); see Supporting Information Table <S1> for complete antibody information. Protein quantification was performed by normalizing to total protein concentration (Li & Shen, <2013>; Moritz, <2017>; Supporting Information Figure <S8>). Brains were fixed in 4% PFA for 48 hr and transferred to PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide and vibratome sectioned at 30 µm. Sections were washed 3× with TBS (pH 7.4) and incubated in 50% ethanol for 5 min, followed by 70% ethanol for 5 min. The sections were then submerged in 0.7% sudan black b dissolved in 70% ethanol for 5 min to quench lipofuscin‐like autofluorescence. Tissues were then rinsed three times for 1–2 min in 50% ethanol. Following this step, tissue sections were transferred from 50% ethanol to TBS and proceeded to immunofluorescence staining as described previously (Orr et al., <2015>, <2014> ). Primary antibodies used are as follows: PHF1 (1:100, kind gift from Dr. Peter Davies), NeuN (1:500 Cell Signaling, D3S31), and histone 3 (1:400, Cell Signaling, D1H2; Supporting Information Table <S1>). Secondary antibodies are as follows: Goat anti‐Mouse IgG (H + L), Alexa Fluor 594 and Goat anti‐Rabbit IgG (H + L), and Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,500, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope, with ZEN 2.3 software. Image analyses were conducted using ImageJ’s FIJI. Analyses were performed on confocal z‐stacks imaged at 40x magnification. A maximum intensity image was created by compressing four z‐stack planes. All analyzed DAPI fields were applied a bandpass filter under the same conditions, applied a threshold, and measured using particle analysis excluding particles smaller than 25 µm2. All particles measured in the analysis were checked for mislabels, and any particles that included two nuclei or exhibited abnormal/incorrect selection were excluded from analysis. Cell type was identified using NeuN (neurons) and PHF1 (NFT‐bearing neurons) immunofluorescence. Following euthanasia, brains were immediately removed and fresh‐frozen in an isopentane/liquid nitrogen slurry. The frozen brains were immediately adhered to the cryotome chuck with optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) precooled to −18°C; 10‐µm coronal sections were collected and mounted on superfrost plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). After sectioning, slides were fixed for 10 min in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature, rinsed 3× in TBS, and stained with SA β‐gal staining solution overnight (Dimri et al., <1995>). Following SA β‐gal staining, sections were processed for immunofluorescence as described above. SA β‐gal brightfield images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ci‐L microscope, with a digital site DS‐U2 camera (NIS‐Elements software BR 4.51.00). Coronally sectioned mouse brains (10 µm) were evaluated using DAPI; SA β‐gal‐positive and SA β‐gal‐negative cells in the CA2 region of the hippocampus were counted across eight tissue sections per animal (n = 5 per genotype). Staining was considered positive when granules of blue stain were present. HRR was conducted using two Oxygraph‐2k (models D and G) machines from Oroboros Instruments (Austria). To minimize mitochondrial damage associated with mitochondrial isolation techniques, we measured oxygen consumption in fresh brain tissue homogenates (Makrecka‐Kuka, Krumschnabel, & Gnaiger, <2015>). Whole hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum were homogenized with ~15 strokes using a Kontes glass homogenizer in 5% w/v ice cold MiRO6. Two milligram of brain homogenate was loaded into the chamber, and experiments were carried out when oxygen concentration in each well was saturated under atmospheric conditions (~190 nM/ml O2). All reagents and SUIT protocol were described previously (Pesta et al., <2011>) with small modifications. Briefly, 1.25 mM ADP was sufficient for saturation in brain homogenate, rotenone was added at a concentration of 1 µM, and FCCP was added in a single injection at a concentration of 0.5 µM.

0/0 mice aged 19–20 months were randomized to receive DQ senolytic (5 mg/kg dasatinib [LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA] with 50 mg/kg quercetin [Sigma‐Aldrich]) or vehicle (60% Phosal 50 PG, 30% PEG 400%, and 10% ethanol) via oral gavage as described previously (Ogrodnik et al., <2017>). Mice were weighed and fasted for 2 hr prior to treatment. One month after the first treatment, senolytic or vehicle gavage continued on a biweekly basis for a total of six treatment sessions over 12 weeks. Within 2 weeks of the final treatment, all mice underwent MRI analyses. MRI experiments were performed on an 11.7 Tesla scanner (BioSpec, Bruker, Billerica, MA). A surface coil was used for brain imaging and a heart coil (Muir, Shen, & Duong, <2008>) for arterial spin labeling. Coil‐to‐coil electromagnetic interaction was actively decoupled. Mice were maintained on 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia for MRI duration. Anatomical MRI: Anatomical images were obtained using a fast spin‐echo sequence with a matrix = 128 x 128, field of view (FOV) = 1.28cm × 1.28 cm, repetition time (TR) = 4,000 ms, and effective echo times = 25 ms. Thirty 1‐mm coronal images were acquired with four averages. Total scan time is equal to 8.5 min. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using continuous arterial spin labeling technique with single shot, spin‐echo, echo‐planar imaging and analyzed as previously described (Shen, Huang, & Duong, <2015>). The images were acquired with partial Fourier (3/4) acquisition, matrix size = 64 × 64, FOV = 1.28 cm x 1.28 cm, TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 10.59 ms, and postlabeling delay = 350 ms. Seven 1‐mm coronal images were acquired with 100 repetitions. Total scan time is equal to 10 min."
PMC6260915_7,"Analyses: MRI analysis was conducted using Stimulate (Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN) running on a CentOS5 Linux Operating System (Strupp, <1996>)  Anatomical MRI images were used to measure cortex, subcortex, ventricle, and whole brain volume. The desired regions of interest (ROIs) were outlined, and volumes were obtained by multiplying ROI total voxels by voxel volume (0.004 mm3). Ventricular volume was obtained by thresholding anatomical image voxels to highlight regions of greater intensity, followed by ROI traces of the target regions. Whole brain volume was obtained by ROI trace after removal of the skull using a local Gaussian distribution 3D segmentation MATLAB code (Wang, Li, Sun, Xia, & Kao, <2009>). Measurements were taken from distinct samples. Key finding was repeated in separate mouse cohorts and is listed in Extended Data Figures. Each age cohort for all analyses contained three to nine animals (specified in figure legends); both males and females were included. Only females were included in DQ treatment and MRI analyses due to animal availability. Statistics were not used to predetermine sample sizes, but instead was determined empirically from previous experimental experience with similar assays and/or from sizes generally employed in the field. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Genotype and treatment comparisons were analyzed using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc or unpaired t test unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Respirometric data, brain volume, and cerebral blood flow data were analyzed using two‐way ANOVAs (genotype × respirometric parameter) and (treatment × brain region), respectively, with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons. The PSP group contained 14 samples and was compared to 10 age‐matched controls with both sexes included; the significance was determined with unpaired two‐tailed t test. We performed ANOVA analysis of the log base 10 transformed CDKN2A expression as predicted by the levels of AD pathology; in addition, we used the more conservative Kendall’s Tau rank correlation to test this association as well. The human CDKN2A and AD pathology analyses were performed using the R v3+ (Vienna, Austria) environment for statistical computing using an accountable data analysis process.

Tau protein accumulation is the most common pathology among degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and over twenty others. Tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation is the closest correlate with cognitive decline and cell loss (Arriagada, Growdon, Hedley‐Whyte, & Hyman, <1992>), yet mechanisms mediating tau toxicity are poorly understood. NFT formation does not induce apoptosis (de Calignon, Spires‐Jones, Pitstick, Carlson, & Hyman, 2009), which suggests that secondary mechanisms are driving toxicity. Transcriptomic analyses of NFT‐containing neurons microdissected from postmortem AD brain revealed an expression profile consistent with cellular senescence. This complex stress response induces aberrant cell cycle activity, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, and metabolic dysfunction. Using four AD transgenic mouse models, we found that NFTs, but not Aβ plaques, display a senescence‐like phenotype. Cdkn2a transcript level, a hallmark measure of senescence, directly correlated with brain atrophy and NFT burden in mice. This relationship extended to postmortem brain tissue from humans with PSP to indicate a phenomenon common to tau toxicity. Tau transgenic mice with late‐stage pathology were treated with senolytics to remove senescent cells. Despite the advanced age and disease progression, MRI brain imaging and histopathological analyses indicated a reduction in total NFT density, neuron loss, and ventricular enlargement. Collectively, these findings indicate a strong association between the presence of NFTs and cellular senescence in the brain, which contributes to neurodegeneration. Given the prevalence of tau protein deposition among neurodegenerative diseases, these findings have broad implications for understanding, and potentially treating, dozens of brain diseases. ."
PMC5577152_0,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is highly soluble and natively unfolded. Its dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where it aggregates within neurons. Deciphering the physiological and pathogenic roles of human Tau (hTau) is crucial to further understand the mechanisms leading to its dysfunction in vivo. We have used a knock-out/knock-in strategy in Drosophila to generate a strain with hTau inserted into the endogenous fly tau locus and expressed under the control of the endogenous fly tau promoter, thus avoiding potential toxicity due to genetic over-expression. hTau knock-in (KI) proteins were expressed at normal, endogenous levels, bound to fly microtubules and were post-translationally modified, hence displaying physiological properties. We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo. We warmly thank Dr S. Feuillette for advice regarding the  in vivo  microtubule-binding assay and Dr P. Davies for generously sharing the PHF1 antibody. Imaging analysis of photoreceptor degeneration was performed in the FACS & Imaging Core Facility at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing. Dr Dobson helped with statistics (R).

M.K.G. received support from the Cologne Graduate School of Ageing Research. Dysfunction and aggregation of highly post-translationally modified, microtubule-binding Tau proteins is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prominent Tauopathy. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to Tau dysfunction and accumulation are still not entirely understood and, to date, no treatment has been successfully developed to prevent, halt or cure AD. Importantly, the vast majority of Tauopathy cases, including AD, occur sporadically without any mutation in the MAPT gene (for review see ref. <1>). Yet, most of the animal models that have been developed to model Tau pathology, both in rodents and in invertebrates such as the fruitfly Drosophila, are based on ectopic expression of human Tau (hTau) transgenes (for review see ref. <2>). These models can be highly informative, but they often strongly over-express normal hTau proteins, or make use of pathogenic tau mutations observed in familial Tauopathies, such as P301L or ΔK280<3>. These models have greatly contributed to the understanding of neurotoxic effects and molecular alterations induced by multiple pathogenic forms of hTau proteins, but they cannot, by nature, recapture some important aspects of sporadic AD, such as the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on hTau function or the binding of hTau to microtubules under physiological conditions. Hence, it is of particular importance to generate in parallel, models of hTau pathology with normal, endogenous expression levels, to decipher the physiological roles of hTau without the drawback of artificial over-expression. One way to generate such models is to use a targeted knock-out/knock-in strategy, to ensure that the human gene is expressed under the control of the endogenous promoter of the orthologous gene in the model organism.Recently, a new hTau PTM, reversible lysine (K) acetylation has been highlighted. Lysine acetylation is observed within hTau aggregates in AD brains, with so far 4 acetylated lysines being identified, namely K174, K274, K280 and K281<4>–<8>. Interestingly, the first in vivo studies suggested a strong impact of acetylation at these epitopes on hTau turnover, leading to toxicity and neurodegeneration<5>, <9>, impaired synaptic plasticity and memory loss<8>. Further, in vitro evidence suggests that hTau acetylation on multiple lysines could regulate hTau-induced toxicity<4>, <10>, <11>, modulating its aggregation propensity and regulating its microtubule bundling function<4>, <10>. More than 27 hTau acetylation sites have been identified in vitro so far<12>, suggesting that the impact of acetylation on hTau regulation and toxicity could be much broader. Therefore, we generated a new Drosophila model of hTau KI, where hTau was expressed under the control of the endogenous Drosophila tau promoter, thereby allowing the study of hTau biology and toxicity under in vivo physiological conditions. The model was generated by inserting into a tau knock-out (KO) fly line<13> the full-length hTau open reading frame. Using this approach, we achieved hTau expression levels and pattern that matched those of the endogenous fly Tau proteins. hTau KI proteins bound to fly microtubules and were both phosphorylated and acetylated, hence displaying physiological characteristics. Using this new Drosophila hTau KI model, we studied the effects of lysine acetylation on hTau-induced toxicity. We simultaneously mutated 4 lysine residues on hTau that were previously shown to be acetylated in vitro using mass spectrometry<4>, <11> and that were shown to regulate microtubule bundling in vitro, namely K163, K280, K281 and K369<4>. Lysines were mutated to either glutamine (hTau-4Q), to mimic acetylation, or to arginine (hTau-4R), to mimic de-acetylated lysine residues. We observed that KI flies expressing the 4Q acetyl-mimic mutant form of hTau displayed a strikingly different hTau phosphorylation pattern and microtubule-binding affinity from flies expressing the wt- or the 4R-hTau forms, but hTau solubility remained unaffected. Interestingly, pseudo-acetylation of hTau significantly ameliorated amyloid beta (Aβ) toxicity. Altogether, our results suggest that hTau multi-acetylation modulates hTau function and phosphorylation, and leads to ameliorated Aβ toxicity. To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>). The resulting protein was a fusion between a small N-terminal Drosophila Tau (dTau) sequence encoded by exon 1, and hTau (Fig. <1b> and Supplementary Figure <2>), and had an apparent molecular weight of 80kDa as observed by western blot using an anti-hTau antibody (Fig. <1c>). Of note, homozygous hTau KI flies did not express endogenous dTau proteins (Fig. <1c>) and were homozygous viable. Since hTau expression should now be regulated by the endogenous dTau promoter, we determined whether hTau KI proteins were expressed in the fly nervous system in a similar way to the endogenous fly Tau proteins. We observed comparable levels of Tau expression in heads of wild type (WT) and hTau KI flies, by qRT-PCR using primers targeting the fly tau exon 1 that is expressed in both fly lines (Fig. <1d>). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis of hTau KI fly embryos indicated that hTau proteins were expressed in the brain, the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and the central nervous system (CNS) (Fig. <2a and b>). This expression pattern was very similar to that of dTau proteins in WT fly embryos, observed using an anti-dTau antibody (Fig. <2c and d>). Correspondingly, hTau was expressed in the brain of adult hTau KI flies (Supplementary Figure <3a>) in a similar fashion as dTau proteins in WT brains (Supplementary Figure <2b>)."
PMC5577152_1,"The specificity of the anti-hTau and anti-dTau antibodies was verified in embryos and brains of control flies (Supplementary Figure <3c and d> and Supplementary Figure <4>)  To further characterise hTau species expressed in the hTau KI model, we performed 2D gel electrophoresis on head extracts from adult hTau KI flies (Fig. <3a>, upper panel). Interestingly, western blot analysis using an anti-total-hTau antibody revealed the presence of several hTau isovariants in hTau KI fly heads, characterised by different isoelectrical points. To determine whether these variants were the result of varying patterns of phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that modulates protein charge, we performed a phosphatase treatment on hTau KI protein extracts prior to 2D electrophoresis. This resulted in a pronounced shift of hTau species towards a more basic pH (Fig. <3a>, lower panel). These results indicate that, even though hTau proteins were not over-expressed, they were post-translationally modified and highly phosphorylated. rhetorical Figure 1 Generation of the hTau KI Drosophila line. (a) Schematic representation of the genetic region encompassing the tau gene in Drosophila. Coding exons of Drosophila tau are represented in purple. hTau full-length (2N4R) cDNA sequence (grey) was inserted in place of tau exons 2–6 to generate the hTau KI fly line. A more detailed representation is shown in Supplementary Figure <1>. (b) The expected hTau KI protein product is a fusion of dTau exon 1 (purple) and hTau (grey) (c). Western blot analysis of head extracts from WT, tau KO and hTau KI flies using anti-hTau and anti-dTau antibodies, indicated that hTau was expressed following its knock-in into the endogenous fly tau locus. The apparent molecular weight of the hTau KI protein was 80 kDa. No dTau proteins were expressed in homozygous hTau KI flies. Actin is shown as a loading control (western blots were cropped in this figure; full blots are shown in Supplementary Figure <15>). (d) Tau mRNA levels measured by qRT-PCR in heads of 20-day-old hTau KI flies were comparable to those of WT flies (p > 0.05, Student’s t-test, n = 3–5 biological replicates). Primers were designed to detect fly tau exon 1, present in both fly lines. To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>).

Immunofluorescence on hTau KI fly embryos (a,b) indicated that hTau was localised to the fly nervous system (Br: brain, VNC: ventral nerve cord, PNS: peripheral nervous system), thereby showing a comparable expression pattern to dTau proteins (c,d) in WT embryos. Scale bar: 50 µm. To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>).

This resulted in a pronounced shift of hTau species towards a more basic pH (Fig. <3a>, lower panel). These results indicate that, even though hTau proteins were not over-expressed, they were post-translationally modified and highly phosphorylated. rhetorical Figure 3 hTau KI proteins were highly post-translationally modified and bound to microtubules.

The vehicle, i.e. DMSO, was used for control experiments. S: supernatant, P: pellet. Western blots were cropped in this figure; full blots are shown in Supplementary Figure <16>. To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>). The resulting protein was a fusion between a small N-terminal Drosophila Tau (dTau) sequence encoded by exon 1, and hTau (Fig. <1b> and Supplementary Figure <2>), and had an apparent molecular weight of 80kDa as observed by western blot using an anti-hTau antibody (Fig. <1c>). Of note, homozygous hTau KI flies did not express endogenous dTau proteins (Fig. <1c>) and were homozygous viable. Since hTau expression should now be regulated by the endogenous dTau promoter, we determined whether hTau KI proteins were expressed in the fly nervous system in a similar way to the endogenous fly Tau proteins. We observed comparable levels of Tau expression in heads of wild type (WT) and hTau KI flies, by qRT-PCR using primers targeting the fly tau exon 1 that is expressed in both fly lines (Fig. <1d>). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis of hTau KI fly embryos indicated that hTau proteins were expressed in the brain, the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and the central nervous system (CNS) (Fig. <2a and b>). This expression pattern was very similar to that of dTau proteins in WT fly embryos, observed using an anti-dTau antibody (Fig. <2c and d>). Correspondingly, hTau was expressed in the brain of adult hTau KI flies (Supplementary Figure <3a>) in a similar fashion as dTau proteins in WT brains (Supplementary Figure <2b>). The specificity of the anti-hTau and anti-dTau antibodies was verified in embryos and brains of control flies (Supplementary Figure <3c and d> and Supplementary Figure <4>). To further characterise hTau species expressed in the hTau KI model, we performed 2D gel electrophoresis on head extracts from adult hTau KI flies (Fig. <3a>, upper panel). Interestingly, western blot analysis using an anti-total-hTau antibody revealed the presence of several hTau isovariants in hTau KI fly heads, characterised by different isoelectrical points.

These results indicate that, even though hTau proteins were not over-expressed, they were post-translationally modified and highly phosphorylated. We investigated whether hTau KI proteins performed their physiological functions in the fly. As hTau is a microtubule-binding protein, we evaluated whether hTau KI proteins could bind to fly microtubules using an in vivo microtubule-binding assay<14>. We observed that hTau KI proteins precipitated together with acetylated Tubulin, a marker for polymerised microtubules (Fig. <3b>), suggesting that the microtubule-binding function of hTau proteins was preserved in our system. Since hTau expression is usually associated with toxicity (see review ref. <2>), we evaluated whether hTau KI expression had detrimental effects on fly survival or induced neuronal degeneration. Interestingly, hTau KI flies displayed a similar lifespan to WT and tau KO flies (Fig. <4a>, p > 0.05, log-rank test), indicating that hTau expression was not toxic for fly survival. We then analysed, both in fly eyes and brains, whether the expression of hTau KI proteins led to neuronal degeneration. We first evaluated fly eye morphology to assess the potential development of a rough eye phenotype due to hTau expression. However, we did not observe any eye roughening in either young (Fig. <4d>) or old (Fig. <4e>) hTau KI flies, similar to the eyes of WT and tau KO controls (Fig. <4b and c>). In addition, using anti-Chaoptin immunofluorescence to specifically stain rhabdomeres from fly retinas, we did not observe any loss of photoreceptor neurons either in eyes of 3-day-old hTau KI flies (Fig. <4h>) compared to age-matched WT (Fig. <4f>) and tau KO (Fig. <4g>) or in eyes of old hTau KI flies (Fig. <4i>). We next evaluated the levels of the Elav neuronal protein and of two synaptic proteins, Synapsin and Syntaxin, in brain extracts from 20-day-old hTau KI flies and did not observe any alteration of their levels compared to age-matched WT flies (Supplementary Figure <5>), suggesting no neurotoxic effect of hTau expression. Finally, to evaluate whether neuronal function was impaired upon hTau expression, we carried out electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system to quantitatively assess the functional status of this pathway<15> (Fig. <4j and k>). This well-defined neuronal circuit is involved in mediating rapid escape behaviour and was previously shown to deteriorate upon expression of toxic proteins<16>. We measured response latency i.e. the time for the electric signal to reach either the tergotrochanteral (TTM, Fig. <4j>) or the dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM, Fig. <4k>), following stimulation of the giant fiber in the fly brain. We did not detect any alteration of neurotransmission within this circuit in the hTau KI line, in either 15- or 34-day-old flies (Fig. <4j and k>). Thus, the new hTau KI fly model produced functional hTau proteins that were expressed in the normal, endogenous pattern, and that were post-translationally modified by phosphorylation. Furthermore, hTau KI proteins bound to fly microtubules, did not lead to overt neurodegeneration and were not toxic to nervous system functions. rhetorical Figure 4 hTau KI expression did not lead to any major detrimental phenotypes in Drosophila.

Electrophysiology recordings in the TTM (j) and DLM (k) were performed in 15- and 34-day-old hTau KI flies and showed no significant difference in neurotransmission through the giant fiber neuronal system between hTau KI flies and WT controls (p > 0.05, Student’s t-test). To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>).

Next, we investigated whether hTau KI proteins were acetylated. We found that hTau immunoprecipitation from Drosophila heads, followed by western blotting targeting acetylated lysines, revealed the presence of acetylated hTau species in hTau KI flies (Fig. <5a>), suggesting that Tau acetylation is a conserved event in Drosophila. We therefore used our hTau KI model to further investigate, in vivo and under endogenous conditions, the impact of acetylation on hTau function. We selected 4 previously detected acetylation sites from two independent in vitro studies<4>, <11>, namely K163, K280, K281 and K369 (Supplementary Figure <6>). We generated hTau KI fly lines expressing either pseudo-acetylated (hTau-4Q) or pseudo-de-acetylated (hTau-4R) mimic mutants of these sites in the full-length hTau protein. Of note, the non-mutated “hTau KI” line will be named “hTau-wt” in the following experiments. As expected from such a KI system, hTau mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure <7a and b>) were comparable among the three KI lines, allowing unbiased analysis of the functional consequences directly attributable to the generated hTau protein isoforms. We then performed immunofluorescence experiments to confirm proper hTau protein expression in embryos (Supplementary Figure <8>, left panels) and adult brains (Supplementary Figure <8>, right panels) of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies, and observed a similar pattern of hTau expression in their tissues to that in hTau-wt flies. To probe the biological consequences of mimicry of altered patterns of acetylation, we first evaluated neuronal degeneration by analysing eyes of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R flies (Fig. <5b and c>). We did not observe any major detrimental effect of expression of these hTau species, as hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies developed no rough eye phenotype, similar to hTau-wt flies (Fig. <4d>). We then performed an anti-Chaoptin staining on retinas of 3-day-old hTau-4Q (Fig. <5d>) and hTau-4R (Fig. <5e>) KI flies and observed no loss of photoreceptor neurons, similar to what we observed following hTau-wt expression (Fig. <4h>). Next, we evaluated neuronal function of these fly strains by means of electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system and observed no significant detrimental or beneficial effect of hTau-4Q or hTau-4R expression compared to hTau-wt on neurotransmission in the TTM (Fig. <5f>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA) or in the DLM (Fig. <5g>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). We analysed neuronal function of the hTau KI lines through evaluation of fly climbing ability but did not observe any detrimental effect of the expression of any of these hTau species on climbing behaviour compared to tau KO control flies (Fig. <5h>, p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). rhetorical Figure 5 Acetylation of hTau KI proteins did not lead to obvious detrimental effects. (a) hTau proteins were acetylated in hTau KI Drosophila. Immunoprecipitation of hTau followed by western blot against acetylated lysines (upper panel) and total hTau proteins (lower panel) revealed a specific band for acetylated hTau species (asterisk), indicating that hTau proteins were acetylated in hTau KI fly heads. hTau immunoprecipitation on protein extracts from WT flies was performed as a negative control.

We also assessed the effects of hTau pseudo-acetylation status on hTau phosphorylation. Although total hTau levels were not altered by their pseudo-acetylation status (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), hTau phosphorylation was strikingly altered. We analysed a total of 11 hTau phosphorylation sites covered by 5 antibodies (Supplementary Figure <6>) i.e. Tau1 (dephosphorylated S195, S198, S199 and S202), AT8 (pS202/pT205), AT100 (pT212/pS214), pS262 and PHF-1 (pS396/pS404). While phosphorylation at S262 was specifically increased in hTau-4Q mutants (****p < 0.0001, vs. hTau-wt and hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), all of the 10 other investigated phosphorylation sites were severely dephosphorylated compared to both hTau-wt and hTau-4R expressing flies (***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>). Notably, this effect was also observed in older flies (Supplementary Figure <9>). Next, we analysed hTau phosphorylation in pseudo-acetylated or pseudo-de-acetylated forms of a single hTau epitope, i.e. K280 (Supplementary Figure <10>). Besides AT100 phosphorylation, which was significantly decreased in the hTau-K280Q fly line (*p < 0.05 vs. hTau-wt and ***p < 0.001 vs. hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA), we did not observe any significant modulation of hTau phosphorylation following mutation of the single hTau-K280 residue. Since both acetylation and phosphorylation events have been shown to regulate hTau solubility in vitro
<4>, <10>, <17>, we analysed whether hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R species displayed different solubility in vivo. However, we did not observe any significant alteration of hTau solubility in our hTau KI lines following fractionation using a combination of RAB and RIPA-1% SDS buffers (p > 0.05. one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <11a and b>). rhetorical Figure 6 Mimicking multi-acetylation strikingly altered hTau phosphorylation pattern.

We observed that hTau KI proteins precipitated together with acetylated Tubulin, a marker for polymerised microtubules (Fig. <3b>), suggesting that the microtubule-binding function of hTau proteins was preserved in our system. Since hTau expression is usually associated with toxicity (see review ref. <2>), we evaluated whether hTau KI expression had detrimental effects on fly survival or induced neuronal degeneration. Interestingly, hTau KI flies displayed a similar lifespan to WT and tau KO flies (Fig. <4a>, p > 0.05, log-rank test), indicating that hTau expression was not toxic for fly survival. We then analysed, both in fly eyes and brains, whether the expression of hTau KI proteins led to neuronal degeneration. We first evaluated fly eye morphology to assess the potential development of a rough eye phenotype due to hTau expression. However, we did not observe any eye roughening in either young (Fig. <4d>) or old (Fig. <4e>) hTau KI flies, similar to the eyes of WT and tau KO controls (Fig. <4b and c>). In addition, using anti-Chaoptin immunofluorescence to specifically stain rhabdomeres from fly retinas, we did not observe any loss of photoreceptor neurons either in eyes of 3-day-old hTau KI flies (Fig. <4h>) compared to age-matched WT (Fig. <4f>) and tau KO (Fig. <4g>) or in eyes of old hTau KI flies (Fig. <4i>). We next evaluated the levels of the Elav neuronal protein and of two synaptic proteins, Synapsin and Syntaxin, in brain extracts from 20-day-old hTau KI flies and did not observe any alteration of their levels compared to age-matched WT flies (Supplementary Figure <5>), suggesting no neurotoxic effect of hTau expression."
PMC5577152_6,"Finally, to evaluate whether neuronal function was impaired upon hTau expression, we carried out electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system to quantitatively assess the functional status of this pathway<15> (Fig  <4j and k>). This well-defined neuronal circuit is involved in mediating rapid escape behaviour and was previously shown to deteriorate upon expression of toxic proteins<16>. We measured response latency i.e. the time for the electric signal to reach either the tergotrochanteral (TTM, Fig. <4j>) or the dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM, Fig. <4k>), following stimulation of the giant fiber in the fly brain. We did not detect any alteration of neurotransmission within this circuit in the hTau KI line, in either 15- or 34-day-old flies (Fig. <4j and k>). Thus, the new hTau KI fly model produced functional hTau proteins that were expressed in the normal, endogenous pattern, and that were post-translationally modified by phosphorylation. Furthermore, hTau KI proteins bound to fly microtubules, did not lead to overt neurodegeneration and were not toxic to nervous system functions. Next, we investigated whether hTau KI proteins were acetylated. We found that hTau immunoprecipitation from Drosophila heads, followed by western blotting targeting acetylated lysines, revealed the presence of acetylated hTau species in hTau KI flies (Fig. <5a>), suggesting that Tau acetylation is a conserved event in Drosophila. We therefore used our hTau KI model to further investigate, in vivo and under endogenous conditions, the impact of acetylation on hTau function. We selected 4 previously detected acetylation sites from two independent in vitro studies<4>, <11>, namely K163, K280, K281 and K369 (Supplementary Figure <6>). We generated hTau KI fly lines expressing either pseudo-acetylated (hTau-4Q) or pseudo-de-acetylated (hTau-4R) mimic mutants of these sites in the full-length hTau protein. Of note, the non-mutated “hTau KI” line will be named “hTau-wt” in the following experiments. As expected from such a KI system, hTau mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure <7a and b>) were comparable among the three KI lines, allowing unbiased analysis of the functional consequences directly attributable to the generated hTau protein isoforms. We then performed immunofluorescence experiments to confirm proper hTau protein expression in embryos (Supplementary Figure <8>, left panels) and adult brains (Supplementary Figure <8>, right panels) of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies, and observed a similar pattern of hTau expression in their tissues to that in hTau-wt flies. To probe the biological consequences of mimicry of altered patterns of acetylation, we first evaluated neuronal degeneration by analysing eyes of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R flies (Fig. <5b and c>). We did not observe any major detrimental effect of expression of these hTau species, as hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies developed no rough eye phenotype, similar to hTau-wt flies (Fig. <4d>). We then performed an anti-Chaoptin staining on retinas of 3-day-old hTau-4Q (Fig. <5d>) and hTau-4R (Fig. <5e>) KI flies and observed no loss of photoreceptor neurons, similar to what we observed following hTau-wt expression (Fig. <4h>). Next, we evaluated neuronal function of these fly strains by means of electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system and observed no significant detrimental or beneficial effect of hTau-4Q or hTau-4R expression compared to hTau-wt on neurotransmission in the TTM (Fig. <5f>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA) or in the DLM (Fig. <5g>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). We analysed neuronal function of the hTau KI lines through evaluation of fly climbing ability but did not observe any detrimental effect of the expression of any of these hTau species on climbing behaviour compared to tau KO control flies (Fig. <5h>, p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). We also assessed the effects of hTau pseudo-acetylation status on hTau phosphorylation. Although total hTau levels were not altered by their pseudo-acetylation status (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), hTau phosphorylation was strikingly altered. We analysed a total of 11 hTau phosphorylation sites covered by 5 antibodies (Supplementary Figure <6>) i.e. Tau1 (dephosphorylated S195, S198, S199 and S202), AT8 (pS202/pT205), AT100 (pT212/pS214), pS262 and PHF-1 (pS396/pS404). While phosphorylation at S262 was specifically increased in hTau-4Q mutants (****p < 0.0001, vs. hTau-wt and hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), all of the 10 other investigated phosphorylation sites were severely dephosphorylated compared to both hTau-wt and hTau-4R expressing flies (***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>). Notably, this effect was also observed in older flies (Supplementary Figure <9>). Next, we analysed hTau phosphorylation in pseudo-acetylated or pseudo-de-acetylated forms of a single hTau epitope, i.e. K280 (Supplementary Figure <10>). Besides AT100 phosphorylation, which was significantly decreased in the hTau-K280Q fly line (*p < 0.05 vs. hTau-wt and ***p < 0.001 vs. hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA), we did not observe any significant modulation of hTau phosphorylation following mutation of the single hTau-K280 residue. Since both acetylation and phosphorylation events have been shown to regulate hTau solubility in vitro
<4>, <10>, <17>, we analysed whether hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R species displayed different solubility in vivo. However, we did not observe any significant alteration of hTau solubility in our hTau KI lines following fractionation using a combination of RAB and RIPA-1% SDS buffers (p > 0.05. one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <11a and b>).
hTau microtubule-binding function is regulated by its charge, and is therefore influenced by post-translational modifications<18>, <19>, thus, we evaluated whether hTau pseudo-acetylation or pseudo-de-acetylation impaired its microtubule-binding properties (Fig. <7>). Surprisingly, we observed that hTau-4Q species, despite a globally reduced phosphorylation status (Fig. <6>), were less abundant in the fraction enriched for polymerised microtubules than both hTau-wt and hTau-4R isoforms (*p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <7a and b>). These data suggest that pseudo-acetylated hTau-4Q species were less efficient at binding to microtubules than hTau-wt or pseudo-de-acetylated hTau. This effect did not translate into decreased levels of total acetyl-Tubulin, as observed in head extracts from hTau-4Q KI flies compared to hTau-wt and hTau-4R KI flies (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <12>). We also analysed microtubule binding of the hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R species (Supplementary Figure <13>). We observed no significant difference in microtubule binding ability of these hTau species compared to hTau-wt proteins (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). rhetorical Figure 7 hTau-4Q KI proteins displayed reduced microtubule-binding affinity. (a) In vivo microtubule-binding assay was performed on protein extracts from 2-day-old hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI fly heads. Taxol was used to induce microtubule polymerisation, and DMSO, the vehicle, was used as a control. S: supernatant, P: pellet. Western blots were cropped in this figure; full blots are shown in Supplementary Figure <19>. (b) Quantification of the proportion of microtubule-bound hTau proteins in hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI lines, in Taxol conditions. Results are expressed relative to levels measured in hTau-wt KI flies (*p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, n = 3/genotype). To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>). The resulting protein was a fusion between a small N-terminal Drosophila Tau (dTau) sequence encoded by exon 1, and hTau (Fig. <1b> and Supplementary Figure <2>), and had an apparent molecular weight of 80kDa as observed by western blot using an anti-hTau antibody (Fig. <1c>). Of note, homozygous hTau KI flies did not express endogenous dTau proteins (Fig."
PMC5577152_7," <1c>) and were homozygous viable  Since hTau expression should now be regulated by the endogenous dTau promoter, we determined whether hTau KI proteins were expressed in the fly nervous system in a similar way to the endogenous fly Tau proteins. We observed comparable levels of Tau expression in heads of wild type (WT) and hTau KI flies, by qRT-PCR using primers targeting the fly tau exon 1 that is expressed in both fly lines (Fig. <1d>). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis of hTau KI fly embryos indicated that hTau proteins were expressed in the brain, the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and the central nervous system (CNS) (Fig. <2a and b>). This expression pattern was very similar to that of dTau proteins in WT fly embryos, observed using an anti-dTau antibody (Fig. <2c and d>). Correspondingly, hTau was expressed in the brain of adult hTau KI flies (Supplementary Figure <3a>) in a similar fashion as dTau proteins in WT brains (Supplementary Figure <2b>). The specificity of the anti-hTau and anti-dTau antibodies was verified in embryos and brains of control flies (Supplementary Figure <3c and d> and Supplementary Figure <4>). To further characterise hTau species expressed in the hTau KI model, we performed 2D gel electrophoresis on head extracts from adult hTau KI flies (Fig. <3a>, upper panel). Interestingly, western blot analysis using an anti-total-hTau antibody revealed the presence of several hTau isovariants in hTau KI fly heads, characterised by different isoelectrical points. To determine whether these variants were the result of varying patterns of phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that modulates protein charge, we performed a phosphatase treatment on hTau KI protein extracts prior to 2D electrophoresis. This resulted in a pronounced shift of hTau species towards a more basic pH (Fig. <3a>, lower panel). These results indicate that, even though hTau proteins were not over-expressed, they were post-translationally modified and highly phosphorylated. We investigated whether hTau KI proteins performed their physiological functions in the fly. As hTau is a microtubule-binding protein, we evaluated whether hTau KI proteins could bind to fly microtubules using an in vivo microtubule-binding assay<14>. We observed that hTau KI proteins precipitated together with acetylated Tubulin, a marker for polymerised microtubules (Fig. <3b>), suggesting that the microtubule-binding function of hTau proteins was preserved in our system.

We then analysed, both in fly eyes and brains, whether the expression of hTau KI proteins led to neuronal degeneration. We first evaluated fly eye morphology to assess the potential development of a rough eye phenotype due to hTau expression. However, we did not observe any eye roughening in either young (Fig. <4d>) or old (Fig. <4e>) hTau KI flies, similar to the eyes of WT and tau KO controls (Fig. <4b and c>). In addition, using anti-Chaoptin immunofluorescence to specifically stain rhabdomeres from fly retinas, we did not observe any loss of photoreceptor neurons either in eyes of 3-day-old hTau KI flies (Fig. <4h>) compared to age-matched WT (Fig. <4f>) and tau KO (Fig. <4g>) or in eyes of old hTau KI flies (Fig. <4i>). We next evaluated the levels of the Elav neuronal protein and of two synaptic proteins, Synapsin and Syntaxin, in brain extracts from 20-day-old hTau KI flies and did not observe any alteration of their levels compared to age-matched WT flies (Supplementary Figure <5>), suggesting no neurotoxic effect of hTau expression. Finally, to evaluate whether neuronal function was impaired upon hTau expression, we carried out electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system to quantitatively assess the functional status of this pathway<15> (Fig. <4j and k>). This well-defined neuronal circuit is involved in mediating rapid escape behaviour and was previously shown to deteriorate upon expression of toxic proteins<16>. We measured response latency i.e. the time for the electric signal to reach either the tergotrochanteral (TTM, Fig. <4j>) or the dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM, Fig. <4k>), following stimulation of the giant fiber in the fly brain. We did not detect any alteration of neurotransmission within this circuit in the hTau KI line, in either 15- or 34-day-old flies (Fig. <4j and k>).

To probe the biological consequences of mimicry of altered patterns of acetylation, we first evaluated neuronal degeneration by analysing eyes of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R flies (Fig. <5b and c>). We did not observe any major detrimental effect of expression of these hTau species, as hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies developed no rough eye phenotype, similar to hTau-wt flies (Fig. <4d>). We then performed an anti-Chaoptin staining on retinas of 3-day-old hTau-4Q (Fig. <5d>) and hTau-4R (Fig. <5e>) KI flies and observed no loss of photoreceptor neurons, similar to what we observed following hTau-wt expression (Fig. <4h>). Next, we evaluated neuronal function of these fly strains by means of electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system and observed no significant detrimental or beneficial effect of hTau-4Q or hTau-4R expression compared to hTau-wt on neurotransmission in the TTM (Fig. <5f>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA) or in the DLM (Fig. <5g>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). We analysed neuronal function of the hTau KI lines through evaluation of fly climbing ability but did not observe any detrimental effect of the expression of any of these hTau species on climbing behaviour compared to tau KO control flies (Fig. <5h>, p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). We also assessed the effects of hTau pseudo-acetylation status on hTau phosphorylation. Although total hTau levels were not altered by their pseudo-acetylation status (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), hTau phosphorylation was strikingly altered. We analysed a total of 11 hTau phosphorylation sites covered by 5 antibodies (Supplementary Figure <6>) i.e."
PMC5577152_8,"Tau1 (dephosphorylated S195, S198, S199 and S202), AT8 (pS202/pT205), AT100 (pT212/pS214), pS262 and PHF-1 (pS396/pS404)  While phosphorylation at S262 was specifically increased in hTau-4Q mutants (****p < 0.0001, vs. hTau-wt and hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), all of the 10 other investigated phosphorylation sites were severely dephosphorylated compared to both hTau-wt and hTau-4R expressing flies (***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>). Notably, this effect was also observed in older flies (Supplementary Figure <9>). Next, we analysed hTau phosphorylation in pseudo-acetylated or pseudo-de-acetylated forms of a single hTau epitope, i.e. K280 (Supplementary Figure <10>). Besides AT100 phosphorylation, which was significantly decreased in the hTau-K280Q fly line (*p < 0.05 vs. hTau-wt and ***p < 0.001 vs. hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA), we did not observe any significant modulation of hTau phosphorylation following mutation of the single hTau-K280 residue. Since both acetylation and phosphorylation events have been shown to regulate hTau solubility in vitro
<4>, <10>, <17>, we analysed whether hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R species displayed different solubility in vivo. However, we did not observe any significant alteration of hTau solubility in our hTau KI lines following fractionation using a combination of RAB and RIPA-1% SDS buffers (p > 0.05. one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <11a and b>).

These data suggest that pseudo-acetylated hTau-4Q species were less efficient at binding to microtubules than hTau-wt or pseudo-de-acetylated hTau. This effect did not translate into decreased levels of total acetyl-Tubulin, as observed in head extracts from hTau-4Q KI flies compared to hTau-wt and hTau-4R KI flies (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <12>). We also analysed microtubule binding of the hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R species (Supplementary Figure <13>). We observed no significant difference in microtubule binding ability of these hTau species compared to hTau-wt proteins (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Finally, we used our hTau KI lines to gain insight into the interaction of amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau acetylation, and investigated whether acetylated hTau KI lines altered Aβ toxicity in vivo. We made use of the previously generated inducible model, that expresses arctic mutant Aβ42 solely in adult neurons and causes toxicity when expressed in adult fly neurons by the elav gene switch (elavGS) driver<16>, <20>. We crossed the flies expressing arctic Aβ42 with the different hTau KI flies, and assessed the phosphorylation pattern, and climbing behaviour of the progeny. First, we measured the levels of Aβ42 across the three groups of flies co-expressing arctic Aβ42 in combination with any of the hTauKI lines (Aβ42 arc/+; hTauKI/elavGS,hTauKI), and observed similar levels of Aβ42 protein (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Supplemental Figure <14>). Next, we measured the levels of total Tau, and of phosphorylated Tau at the AT8 site, which is associated with AD pathogenesis<21>. We found both that the striking pattern of hTau phosphorylation at the AT8 site was maintained, similar to flies expressing hTau KI lines alone (Fig. <8a and c>), and that total hTau levels were not changed (Fig. <8b and d>). Flies expressing either hTau-4Q mutants alone or co-expressing arctic Aβ42 and hTau-4Q mutants were severely dephosphorylated at the AT8 site, compared to flies expressing either hTau-wt and hTau-4R, with or without arctic Aβ42 (*p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <8a and c>). We went on further to determine whether pseudo-acetylation of Tau was associated with any phenotypic consequences in the arctic Aβ42 expressing flies. Interestingly, we found that flies co-expressing hTau-4Q with arctic Aβ42 showed an improved climbing behaviour in comparison to control flies, co-expressing arctic Aβ42 and hTau-wt (*p < 0.05, beta regression). On the other hand, hTau-4R significantly worsened arctic Aβ42 toxicity in comparison to control flies co-expressing arctic Aβ42 and hTau-wt (****p < 0.0001, beta regression), (Fig. <8e>). rhetorical Figure 8 Mimicking multi-acetylation of hTau KI proteins ameliorated Aβ toxicity. (a) Western blot analyses (a and b) and quantification (c and d) of hTau phosphorylation (AT8) and total hTau levels were carried out respectively on head extracts of 12 day-old flies either co-expressing Aβ (+RU) with the different homozygous hTau KI lines, hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R, or expressing homozygous hTau KI lines alone (−RU), grown at 28 °C. Results were normalised to Actin. (n = 3/genotype, *p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). Western blots were cropped in this figure. Full blots are shown in Supplementary Figure <20>. (e) Climbing assay shows that the flies co-expressing Aβ (+RU) and homozygous hTau-4Q line have improved climbing (n = 3, *p < 0.05, beta regression analyses) and flies co-expressing Aβ (+RU) and homozygous hTau-4R line climb worse (n = 3, ****p < 0.0001, beta regression analyses) in comparison to control flies co-expressing Aβ (+RU) and homozygous hTau-wt. Homozygous hTau KI lines (−RU) alone did not differ in their climbing ability. Genotype of flies expressing Aβ42 arc in the different hTauKI homozygous backgrounds, Aβ42 arc/+; hTauKI (wt, 4R or 4Q)/elavGS,hTauKI (wt, 4R or 4Q). To generate a Drosophila strain expressing human Tau, we used the previously described Drosophila tau KO line<13>, which specifically lacks tau exons 2–6, to knock in the cDNA sequence of the hTau full-length 2N4R isoform (Fig. <1a> and Supplementary Figure <1>).

We then performed immunofluorescence experiments to confirm proper hTau protein expression in embryos (Supplementary Figure <8>, left panels) and adult brains (Supplementary Figure <8>, right panels) of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies, and observed a similar pattern of hTau expression in their tissues to that in hTau-wt flies. To probe the biological consequences of mimicry of altered patterns of acetylation, we first evaluated neuronal degeneration by analysing eyes of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R flies (Fig. <5b and c>). We did not observe any major detrimental effect of expression of these hTau species, as hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies developed no rough eye phenotype, similar to hTau-wt flies (Fig. <4d>). We then performed an anti-Chaoptin staining on retinas of 3-day-old hTau-4Q (Fig. <5d>) and hTau-4R (Fig. <5e>) KI flies and observed no loss of photoreceptor neurons, similar to what we observed following hTau-wt expression (Fig. <4h>). Next, we evaluated neuronal function of these fly strains by means of electrophysiological recordings from the giant fiber system and observed no significant detrimental or beneficial effect of hTau-4Q or hTau-4R expression compared to hTau-wt on neurotransmission in the TTM (Fig. <5f>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA) or in the DLM (Fig. <5g>, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). We analysed neuronal function of the hTau KI lines through evaluation of fly climbing ability but did not observe any detrimental effect of the expression of any of these hTau species on climbing behaviour compared to tau KO control flies (Fig. <5h>, p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). We also assessed the effects of hTau pseudo-acetylation status on hTau phosphorylation. Although total hTau levels were not altered by their pseudo-acetylation status (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), hTau phosphorylation was strikingly altered. We analysed a total of 11 hTau phosphorylation sites covered by 5 antibodies (Supplementary Figure <6>) i.e. Tau1 (dephosphorylated S195, S198, S199 and S202), AT8 (pS202/pT205), AT100 (pT212/pS214), pS262 and PHF-1 (pS396/pS404). While phosphorylation at S262 was specifically increased in hTau-4Q mutants (****p < 0.0001, vs. hTau-wt and hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>), all of the 10 other investigated phosphorylation sites were severely dephosphorylated compared to both hTau-wt and hTau-4R expressing flies (***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <6a and b>). Notably, this effect was also observed in older flies (Supplementary Figure <9>). Next, we analysed hTau phosphorylation in pseudo-acetylated or pseudo-de-acetylated forms of a single hTau epitope, i.e. K280 (Supplementary Figure <10>). Besides AT100 phosphorylation, which was significantly decreased in the hTau-K280Q fly line (*p < 0.05 vs. hTau-wt and ***p < 0.001 vs. hTau-4R, one-way ANOVA), we did not observe any significant modulation of hTau phosphorylation following mutation of the single hTau-K280 residue. Since both acetylation and phosphorylation events have been shown to regulate hTau solubility in vitro
<4>, <10>, <17>, we analysed whether hTau-wt, hTau-4Q and hTau-4R species displayed different solubility in vivo. However, we did not observe any significant alteration of hTau solubility in our hTau KI lines following fractionation using a combination of RAB and RIPA-1% SDS buffers (p > 0.05. one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <11a and b>)."
PMC5577152_10,"hTau microtubule-binding function is regulated by its charge, and is therefore influenced by post-translational modifications<18>, <19>, thus, we evaluated whether hTau pseudo-acetylation or pseudo-de-acetylation impaired its microtubule-binding properties (Fig  <7>). Surprisingly, we observed that hTau-4Q species, despite a globally reduced phosphorylation status (Fig. <6>), were less abundant in the fraction enriched for polymerised microtubules than both hTau-wt and hTau-4R isoforms (*p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <7a and b>). These data suggest that pseudo-acetylated hTau-4Q species were less efficient at binding to microtubules than hTau-wt or pseudo-de-acetylated hTau. This effect did not translate into decreased levels of total acetyl-Tubulin, as observed in head extracts from hTau-4Q KI flies compared to hTau-wt and hTau-4R KI flies (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Supplementary Figure <12>). We also analysed microtubule binding of the hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R species (Supplementary Figure <13>). We observed no significant difference in microtubule binding ability of these hTau species compared to hTau-wt proteins (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Finally, we used our hTau KI lines to gain insight into the interaction of amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau acetylation, and investigated whether acetylated hTau KI lines altered Aβ toxicity in vivo. We made use of the previously generated inducible model, that expresses arctic mutant Aβ42 solely in adult neurons and causes toxicity when expressed in adult fly neurons by the elav gene switch (elavGS) driver<16>, <20>. We crossed the flies expressing arctic Aβ42 with the different hTau KI flies, and assessed the phosphorylation pattern, and climbing behaviour of the progeny. First, we measured the levels of Aβ42 across the three groups of flies co-expressing arctic Aβ42 in combination with any of the hTauKI lines (Aβ42 arc/+; hTauKI/elavGS,hTauKI), and observed similar levels of Aβ42 protein (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Supplemental Figure <14>). Next, we measured the levels of total Tau, and of phosphorylated Tau at the AT8 site, which is associated with AD pathogenesis<21>. We found both that the striking pattern of hTau phosphorylation at the AT8 site was maintained, similar to flies expressing hTau KI lines alone (Fig. <8a and c>), and that total hTau levels were not changed (Fig. <8b and d>). Flies expressing either hTau-4Q mutants alone or co-expressing arctic Aβ42 and hTau-4Q mutants were severely dephosphorylated at the AT8 site, compared to flies expressing either hTau-wt and hTau-4R, with or without arctic Aβ42 (*p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Fig. <8a and c>). We went on further to determine whether pseudo-acetylation of Tau was associated with any phenotypic consequences in the arctic Aβ42 expressing flies. Interestingly, we found that flies co-expressing hTau-4Q with arctic Aβ42 showed an improved climbing behaviour in comparison to control flies, co-expressing arctic Aβ42 and hTau-wt (*p < 0.05, beta regression). On the other hand, hTau-4R significantly worsened arctic Aβ42 toxicity in comparison to control flies co-expressing arctic Aβ42 and hTau-wt (****p < 0.0001, beta regression), (Fig. <8e>). Altogether, our results indicate that the simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of K163, K280, K281 and K369 drastically alters hTau phosphorylation, modulates hTau microtubule-binding properties in vivo, and unexpectedly ameliorates Aβ toxicity significantly. Model organisms are powerful systems in which to study and understand the function and dysfunction of hTau proteins in vivo. Using a knock-out/knock-in strategy, we have generated a new Drosophila model to investigate hTau function under physiological conditions in vivo. We used this model to evaluate the effects of hTau multi-acetylation, and found an effect on hTau microtubule-binding and phosphorylation. Furthermore, hTau multi-acetylation was associated with improved Aβ toxicity in vivo.We generated hTau KI lines by introducing the full-length 2N4R hTau cDNA sequence into the gene locus of its fly homologue, i.e. Drosophila tau. We took advantage of the previously generated Drosophila tau KO line, which does not express any microtubule-binding dTau isoforms<13>. The resulting hTau KI was a fusion protein holding exon 1 of dTau on its N-terminal end. In contrast to commonly used tags including GFP and mCherry, dTau exon 1 is relatively small (82 amino acids for 8.84 kDa) and is an endogenous fly component, hence mitigating potential artificial toxic effects and abnormal localisation and functions of hTau proteins that may result from a fusion with an exogenous tag. However, whether dTau exon 1 influences hTau biology will deserve further experiments. By using a KI system, we ensured that hTau followed the same expression pattern as endogenous dTau proteins. In addition, hTau KI proteins were expressed from embryonic stages and during adulthood, similarly to dTau, further suggesting that our knock-in strategy was successful.We observed that hTau KI proteins bound to microtubules when expressed under physiological conditions. This result is in contrast with a previous study reporting a very weak microtubule-binding of over-expressed 2N4R hTau proteins in Drosophila, both in the presence or absence of dTau<14>, and suggests that the knock-in strategy was more effective than over-expression systems for investigating this aspect of hTau function. In addition, we observed that hTau KI proteins were highly phosphorylated, further indicating that knocked-in hTau proteins were regulated in accordance with their intrinsic phospho-protein characteristics. Interestingly, hTau KI expression did not result in detectable toxic effects either on fly lifespan or on neuronal degeneration in either fly eyes or brains, or on neuronal function. These observations contrast with the toxic effects obtained following hTau over-expression in Drosophila (for review see ref. <2>), and suggest that expressing physiological, endogenous levels of human Tau protein is essentially harmless in vivo. This new fly tool will therefore enable future studies investigating potential toxic effects triggered following expression of mutant forms of hTau-KI proteins. Homozygous hTau KI flies did not express dTau proteins, hence separating the effects related to hTau expression from those of the endogenous dTau.Following on from our previous study indicating that removal of dTau proteins does not lead to detrimental effects in Drosophila
<13>, we did not observe any eye roughening or loss of photoreceptor neurons in the tau KO fly line. Hence the evaluation of these phenotypes cannot be used to assess a potential compensation of dTau loss of function by hTau KI expression. However, because we observed the binding of hTau proteins to fly microtubules, our results suggest that hTau is indeed functional in this KI system.Interestingly, 2D gel electrophoresis performed on hTau KI fly heads following incubation with lambda phosphatase suggested that other post-translational modifications than phosphorylation were present. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that these proteins were also acetylated. We therefore used our KI system to investigate the impact of multi-site acetylation on hTau function, with a focus on K163, K280, K281 and K369, previously shown to be highly acetylated in two independent in vitro studies<4>, <11>. We generated acetylation- and de-acetylation-mimic mutant forms of hTau to investigate the functional consequences of simultaneously modulating these 4 lysine residues in vivo. First, we observed a striking crosstalk between hTau acetylation and phosphorylation. While phosphorylation on S262 was increased in the hTau-4Q acetylation-mimic mutant, all other investigated hTau phosphorylation sites were severely dephosphorylated. Since hTau is an unstructured protein<22>, it is likely that acetylation events change hTau conformation, as do phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications<23>, <24>."
PMC5577152_11,"Such conformational change, in turn, might have exposed some hTau phospho-epitopes, on one hand, and regulated the binding of kinases and phosphatases to hTau, on the other, thus modifying hTau phosphorylation pattern  In support of our data, a recent paper by Trzeciakiewicz et al. presented similar findings. They showed in vitro that cells co-expressing WT Tau and the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein led to marked Tau dephosphorylation at several sites – AT8, AT270, AT180, and pS262. Furthermore, they showed that expressing either hTau-4Q or a double lysine deletion (ΔK280/ΔK281) also reduced phosphorylation at AT8 and pS262 sites, which was attributed to increased access of the phosphatase PP2A to unbound hTau<25>. However, there were slight differences from our results, since we observed increase in pS262 levels in the hTau-4Q expressing flies, highlighting possible differences between in vitro and in vivo environment. Similar to other published results in mice over-expressing Aβ in a wild-type humanized Tau background<26>, we did not observe Arctic Aβ42-induced changes in the phosphorylation pattern of the hTau KI lines.Previous studies have reported a detrimental effect of hTau-4Q species on microtubule bundling in cell cultures<4>. In accordance with this observation, we found that hTau-4Q KI proteins bound to fly microtubules with a lower efficiency than both hTau-wt and hTau-4R isoforms in vivo. As mentioned above, it is likely that pseudo acetylation on multiple sites causes conformational changes, by possibly neutralising the positive charges of the lysines<27>, which are likely to induce modifications in hTau localisation, protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation in vivo, ultimately potentially regulating its bioavailability for microtubules. It is also possible that the specific increase in S262 phosphorylation, which adds a negative charge to hTau and is known to impair binding to microtubules<22>, accounts for the decreased affinity of hTau-4Q proteins for microtubules. The single K280Q acetylation-mimic mutation on hTau was also shown to significantly alter microtubule bundling in cell cultures<4>, <25>, thus we aimed to investigate whether it was sufficient to reduce hTau binding to fly microtubules in vivo. Interestingly, we did not observe any significant influence of this single-site mutation on hTau microtubule binding properties and phosphorylation - except AT100, which was significantly reduced in hTau-K280Q KI mutants. Very little is known so far about the specific effects of hTau acetylation on microtubule binding and on the crosstalk with hTau phosphorylation, and further studies, both in vitro and in vivo, will be required to investigate these important aspects.Interestingly, the differences we observed in hTau phosphorylation did not influence hTau protein solubility, because all three hTau protein isoforms were highly soluble. This is in line with previous reports indicating that hTau phosphorylation does not necessarily lead to its aggregation<9>, <28>. Further investigation will be required to evaluate whether soluble, oligomeric hTau species are produced in hTau KI flies and whether they contribute to the different phenotypes we observed.We did not observe any obvious positive or negative modulation of neuronal function in hTau-4Q and hTau-4R KI flies as compared to hTau-wt KI flies. However, expression of hTau-4Q and hTau-4R improved or worsened Aβ toxicity respectively in comparison to hTau-wt KI flies. Several hypotheses can be formulated to explain this effect. First, we observed a drastic overall dephosphorylation of pseudo-acetylated hTau-4Q species in vivo. Phosphorylation events within the proline-rich region of hTau have been shown to regulate its binding to SH3 domain-containing interaction partners<29>, <30>, thereby potentially regulating their functions within cells. Moreover, hTau phosphorylation status has been reported to regulate hTau subcellular localisation and, in particular, its binding to the plasma membrane<31>, <32>. These effects, directly linked to hTau phosphorylation, could induce specific cellular adaptations resulting in ameliorated Aβ toxicity. While we did not detect major changes in terms of hTau protein localisation within the embryonic and adult tissues of hTau-4Q flies compared to hTau-wt and hTau-4R flies, further studies will be required to determine whether the subcellular localisation of hTau-4Q proteins is modified. Second, in line with previous cell culture observations<4>, our results indicated a weaker binding of hTau-4Q proteins to fly microtubules. While this aspect would require further investigation, one could speculate that the pool of unbound hTau-4Q proteins triggered specific signalling pathways that ameliorated Aβ toxicity.Noteworthy, the hTau-wt KI line showed similar phenotypes to hTau-4R KI flies in terms of microtubule binding and hTau phosphorylation, both being far apart from phenotypes displayed by hTau-4Q flies. Such results suggest that hTau-wt KI proteins behaved as if they would be de-acetylated in a similar way to hTau-4R species. Further experiments will be important to determine to what extent hTau-wt proteins are acetylated in vivo.In summary, we have generated an hTau KI model where hTau proteins were expressed under the control of the endogenous fly tau promoter in the fly nervous system, and displayed physiological characteristics such as phosphorylation and microtubule-binding properties. In addition, using this KI system, we observed reduced microtubule-binding affinity and severely altered phosphorylation of acetylated hTau species in vivo. Importantly, multi-site pseudo-acetylation of knocked-in hTau proteins unexpectedly led to ameliorated Aβ toxicity. Altogether, our results suggest that acetylation is an important event for the regulation of hTau function in endogenous conditions, and that occurrence of these PTMs on hTau proteins can result in complex effects in vivo. Therefore, better understanding of the complex interactions of PTMs on hTau is vital to determine the best approach to target PTMs as potential therapeutic interventions for AD pathogenesis. We used genomic engineering<33> and a previously generated tau knock-out (KO) Drosophila line<13> to generate the hTau KI strains. The genomic engineering strategy is outlined in Supplementary Figure <1>. hTau KI constructs consisted of hTau 2N4R cDNA and sequences from the endogenous fly tau locus. Acetylation-mimic and de-acetylation-mimic forms of hTau were designed by replacing lysines at positions 163/280/281/369 with glutamine (hTau-4Q) or arginine (hTau-4R), respectively. Constructs were synthesized by Eurofins Genomics (Germany) in a pGEattB vector<33>. hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R KI fly lines were designed by mutating hTau at lysine 280 and were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies). hTau KI fly lines were obtained using the φC31 and attP/attB targeted integration system and constructs were inserted into the attP landing-site located in the endogenous tau locus of Drosophila tau founder lines (Supplementary Figure <1>). Arctic Aβ42 and elav gene switch (elavGS) driver fly lines have been previously described<20>. Positive fly lines were verified by PCR, sequencing and western blotting. The resulting hTau KI proteins were a fusion of dTau exon 1 (82 amino acids) and hTau. All fly stocks were kept at 25 °C in standard conditions as previously described<9>. All fly lines (except hTau-K280Q and hTau-K280R KI lines) were backcrossed into a white Dahomey wild-type (WT), outbred genetic background for at least seven generations prior to experiments. Experiments were carried out with female flies and at 29 °C except otherwise stated. 150 to 200 once-mated female flies per genotype were allocated to food vials at a density of 10 flies per vial and kept at a temperature of 25 °C. The number of dead flies was recorded every 2–3 days as flies were transferred to fresh food."
PMC5577152_12,"Lifespan results are expressed as the proportion of survivors ± 95% confidence interval  Analysis of fly climbing was performed blindly as described before<20>. At least 3 biological replicates of 15–20 females flies per genotype were used for the analysis. Flies used for climbing experiments were kept at 28 °C or 29 °C. This procedure was based on<34> with some modifications. Briefly, embryos were washed in saline solution (0.7% NaCl and 0.03% Triton x-100) and dechorionated with bleach for 3 min. Following fixation in fixative solution (1 vol of heptane and 1 vol of formaldehyde 4%) for 30 min at room temperature, embryos were incubated for one hour at 4 °C in blocking solution (5% BSA in PBT with 0.2% of Triton X-100) and then subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-dTau antibody (1/1000 in PBT with 5% BSA) or with the anti-hTau K9JA antibody (Dako, 1/5000 in PBT with 5% BSA). Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1/200 in PBT with 5% BSA for two hours at 4 °C. Embryos were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI mounting medium and visualised using a LEICA DMI4000B/DFC 340FX inverted microscope and a 10X objective. Flies used for these experiments were kept at 25 °C. Following dissection in 1X PBS and subsequent fixation in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, adult fly brains and thoracico-abdominal ganglia were washed three times in PBST (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100), blocked for one hour in PBST with 5% BSA, and then incubated overnight with anti-human Tau (K9JA) or anti-Drosophila Tau antibodies at a dilution of 1/2000 in PBST with 5% BSA. Anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1/500 in PBST with 5% BSA for one hour. Tissues were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI and images were taken using a Zeiss (UK) LSM 700 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 10x objective. Eye pictures of 3-day-old and 22-day-old flies were taken using a Leica M165 FC stereomicroscope equipped with a motorized stage and the multifocus tool in the Leica application suite software. Retinas of 3- and 22-day-old flies were dissected in 1X PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 hours at 4 °C. Retinas were washed 6 × 30 min in 1 mL PBT (PBS with 0,5% Triton X-100) at room temperature (RT) and subsequently blocked in 1 mL blocking buffer (PBT with 5% fetal bovine serum and 0,01% Sodium Azide) for 60 min at RT. Anti-Chaoptin antibody (24B10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) was used at 1/200 in 300 µL blocking buffer and incubated with the retinas overnight at 4 °C. Following 6 washes of 30 min each in PBT, retinas were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody (1/500 in 300 µL blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C. Retinas were then washed in PBT at RT, incubated in 50% glycerol in PBS for 30 min and subsequently mounted on a microscope slide in Vectashield HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vectorlabs). Imaging was done using a Leica SP5-X confocal microscope. Flies used for these experiments were kept at 25 °C. Recordings from the Giant Fiber circuit were made as described in<13> and initially described by Tanouye and Wyman<35>. Briefly, activation of the giant fiber was achieved in the fly brain using a tungsten stimulating electrode and recordings were made from the tergotrochanteral muscle (TTM) and the contralateral dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM) using glass microelectrodes. For response latency recordings, at least 3–5 single stimuli were given with a 5s rest period between each stimulus. Recordings were performed blindly from at least 4 flies per genotype. 20 female heads per biological replicate were homogenized by sonication in 200 μL of RIPA-1% SDS buffer supplemented with Complete mini without EDTA protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5–10 µg of total proteins were supplemented with 2x LDS containing reducing agent (Invitrogen) or female heads were homogenized directly in Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and heated at 98 °C for 10 minutes prior to loading on Any kD Criterion gels (Biorad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) that were subsequently blocked in TNT buffer (Tris–HCl 15 mM pH 8, NaCl 140 mM, 0.05% Tween) or TBST with 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: anti-dTau (1/10000) ref. <13>, anti-dephosphorylated S195/S198/S199/S202-hTau (Tau1, 1/1000, Millipore), pS202/T205-hTau (AT8, 1/2000, Thermo Scientific), anti-pT212/S214-hTau (AT100, 1/2000, Thermo Scientific), anti-pS262-hTau (1/5000, Invitrogen), anti-pS396/S404 (PHF1, 1/2000, Peter Davies), anti-total hTau K9JA (1/100,000, Dako), anti-Elav (1/1000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)), anti-Synapsin (1/500, DSHB), anti-Syntaxin (1/500, DSHB), anti-acetylated-lysines (9441, 1/1000, Cell Signaling), anti-acetyl-Tubulin (D20G3, 1/2000, Cell Signaling), anti-α-Tubulin (11H10, 1/2000, Cell Signaling) and anti-β-Actin (1/200,000, Abcam). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1/10,000, Invitrogen) were used for 1 h at room temperature and detection was performed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare) and Hyperfilms (GE Healthcare). 20 fly heads were extracted by sonication in 100µL of RIPA buffer supplemented with complete mini without EDTA and acetylation inhibitors (10 µM Trichostatin A, Santa Cruz, and 20mM Nicotinamide, Sigma-Aldrich). 100 µg of total proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without the anti-hTau antibody (1/1000) in a final volume of 100 µL. Next day, samples were incubated with 10 µL of PureProteome Protein G magnetic beads (Millipore) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After several washes, beads were incubated with 15 µL of 2x LDS containing reducing agent (Invitrogen) and heated at 90 °C for 10 minutes. Eluted samples were transferred to clean tubes prior to loading on Any Kd Criterion gels (Biorad). Microtubule-binding experiments were based on previous reports<14> with some modifications. Briefly, 40 female fly heads were extracted in 150 µL of Buffer-C+ (50 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na3VO4 and complete mini without EDTA) containing either 20 µM of Taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma-Aldrich) or the same volume of DMSO, the vehicle. After centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 minutes, supernatants were layered on top of 300 µL of buffer-C+ containing 50% sucrose. Following centrifugation at 100,000 g for one hour, 150 µL of the upper fraction (S) containing soluble tubulin was transferred to a fresh tube. Pellets (P) containing polymerised microtubules were resuspended in 150 µL of 2x LDS containing reducing agent (Invitrogen) by pipetting and incubation in a sonication bath for 5 minutes. Protein concentration of the soluble fraction was measured using the BCA system (Pierce). Equal volumes of soluble and insoluble fractions were loaded on Any kD Criterion Gels for analysis. Temperature was kept at 25 °C throughout the experiment. Binding of hTau species to fly microtubules was evaluated by normalising the percentage of pelleted hTau to the percentage of pelleted acetyl-Tubulin, in Taxol conditions. Heads of hTau KI flies were homogenized by sonication in ice-cold RIPA (Pierce) buffer supplemented with Complete mini without EDTA protease inhibitor (Roche). Eighty micrograms of total proteins were treated with Lambda Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 3 hours at 37 °C. Samples were stored at −80 °C until use for 2D gel electrophoresis. 2D gel electrophoresis experiments were performed as previously described<13> using eighty micrograms of hTau KI fly head protein. Isoelectrofocalisation was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions using Immobiline Drystrips (pH 3–11NL, 11 cm). SDS-PAGE was performed using 10% Bis-Tris IPG + 1 Criterion gels (Biorad) and proteins were transferred to 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes prior to antibody staining. This experiment was performed as in Gorsky et al."
PMC5577152_13,"<9> using heads of hTau-wt, -4Q and -4R KI flies (20 heads per biological replicate)  Tissues were homogenized by sonication in 150 μL ice-cold RAB buffer (Pierce) and Complete mini without EDTA protease inhibitor (Roche) and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (“soluble fraction”) was collected and the pellet was homogenized in 150 μL of RIPA-1% SDS by pipetting. Homogenized pellets were centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at RT and the supernatant was collected (“insoluble fraction”). Protein concentration was evaluated in the soluble fraction using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 5 μg of the soluble fraction and twice the amount of the equivalent volume of the insoluble fraction were used for western blotting. A Trizol-Chloroform-based protocol (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from heads of female flies (25 heads per replicate). Following treatment with DNAse I (Ambion), 300 ng of RNA were subjected to cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript Vilo Mastermix (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan primers targeting either exon 1 of Drosophila tau or a hTau sequence common to the three hTau-wt/4Q/4R KI lines (Applied Biosystems) in a 7900HT real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression of tau was determined by the ΔΔC
T method and was normalised to actin5c. Three to five independent biological replicates per group were analysed. Results are plotted as mean ± SEM. Quantification of Aβ1–42 was carried out as previously described<16>. To extract total Aβ, five Drosophila heads were homogenised in 50 µl GnHCl extraction buffer (5 M Guanidine HCl, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.3, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340) and 5 mM EDTA), centrifuged at 21,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C, and cleared supernatant retained as the total fly Aβ sample. Aβ was measured using the hAmyloid β42 ELISA kit (IBL INTERNATIONAL). N of 4 individual samples were diluted in sample/standard dilution buffer and ELISA performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Protein extracts were quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad protein assay reagent; Bio-Rad laboratories (UK) Ltd) and the amount of Aβ in each sample expressed as a ratio of the total protein content (pmol/g total protein). For lifespan experiments, statistical differences were assessed using the log-rank test. Other results are expressed as mean ± SEM and differences between mean values were determined using either Student’s t test, one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test, and beta regression analyses using either Graphpad Prism software, JMP 12 or R. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is highly soluble and natively unfolded. Its dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where it aggregates within neurons. Deciphering the physiological and pathogenic roles of human Tau (hTau) is crucial to further understand the mechanisms leading to its dysfunction in vivo. We have used a knock-out/knock-in strategy in Drosophila to generate a strain with hTau inserted into the endogenous fly tau locus and expressed under the control of the endogenous fly tau promoter, thus avoiding potential toxicity due to genetic over-expression. hTau knock-in (KI) proteins were expressed at normal, endogenous levels, bound to fly microtubules and were post-translationally modified, hence displaying physiological properties. We used this new model to investigate the effects of acetylation on hTau toxicity in vivo. The simultaneous pseudo-acetylation of hTau at lysines 163, 280, 281 and 369 drastically decreased hTau phosphorylation and significantly reduced its binding to microtubules in vivo. These molecular alterations were associated with ameliorated amyloid beta toxicity. Our results indicate acetylation of hTau on multiple sites regulates its biology and ameliorates amyloid beta toxicity in vivo. ."
PMC6150274_0,"Harmine belongs to a group of β-carboline alkaloids endowed with antitumor properties. Harmine and its derivatives are thought to bind to DNA and interfere with topoisomerase activities. We investigated the base-dependent binding of harmine, and three of its synthetic anticancer-active derivatives to the genomic DNA from calf thymus and two synthetic 20-mer double helices, the poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) and the poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), by means of UV-Vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. The data show that the DNA binding and stabilising properties of the investigated derivatives are base pair-dependent. These results could be used as a guide to design and develop further bioactive analogues. This work was supported by “Finanziamento della Ricerca di Ateneo 2016” from the University of Naples Federico II (prot. No. 0016505 to C.G.) and by the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC) (IG 16730 to B.P.). Harmine (HR) is a widespread natural tricyclic β-carboline alkaloid, isolated from the seeds of Peganum harmala, a middle-eastern plant that has been known about for a long time and used in folk medicine [<1>,<2>,<3>]. Its structure is characterised by a pyridine ring fused to an indolyl ring, a methyl and a methoxy group at positions 1 and 7, respectively. Regardless of popular beliefs, there is a kernel of truth in the supposed beneficial effects of HR as it was proved to possess many very interesting properties, including antimicrobial, antioxidative, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic activity, and more [<4>,<5>,<6>,<7>,<8>,<9>,<10>,<11>,<12>]. It goes without saying that the anticancer property has emerged as the foremost alluring facet, prompting many groups to dedicate their efforts to synthesising harmine derivatives with enhanced antitumor properties against human cancer-cells [<11>,<13>,<14>].The HR antiproliferative mechanism of action is far from being fully disclosed but it has become clear that the DNA intercalation is a driving force. HR is mainly known to interfere with the DNA topoisomerase activity [<15>], but also to induce DNA damage [<16>], and to inhibit the telomerase that leads to cell senescence [<17>]. The key factors are the HR tricyclic planar molecular geometry and identities and arrangement of its substituents [<14>,<18>,<19>].To achieve a deeper understanding of the HR-derivatives binding to the DNA, herein we report a UV/Vis- and CD-based investigation of the DNA-binding properties of three synthetic HR derivatives (compounds I–III, <Figure 1>), which were previously proved to have enhanced activity against human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) in the µM range [<14>]. The joint UV/Vis-circular dichroism approach is widely adopted for studying DNA-ligand systems [<18>,<20>,<21>]. It is readily diagnostic of the ligand-DNA interaction and of the ensuing stabilisation effects, as well as for the binding-induced structural perturbations. Last and by no means least, the required sample amount is modest compared to other techniques. Calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was used as a reference, and two synthetic 20-mer duplexes were investigated for assessing the differential behaviour against GC and AT segments: the poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), hereafter d(GC)10, and the poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), referred to as d(AT)10 from now on.On a structural basis, I differs from HR in the methoxy group at position 4 rather than 7. Compound II has an additional methyl group at position 9 with respect to I, whereas III features a fourth ring fused to the β-carboline structure, with a methoxy in position 4 and a benzyl group bound to the pyridine nitrogen (<Figure 1>). The interaction between the investigated compounds and the DNA was analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. First, UV melting curves of the ctDNA at increasing HR concentration were recorded to evaluate the HR binding and stabilising capability. Harmine sizeably stabilises the ctDNA even at the 0.10 [harmine]:[ctDNA]bp ratio, whereas only a slight difference occurs between the UV thermal denaturation profiles at [harmine]:[ctDNA]bp ratios of 0.33 and 0.50, with the latter showing the maximum stabilizing effect (ΔTm = 20 °C) (<Figure 2>a). The 0.50 ratio was thereby picked as a standard for the measures to follow, for studying the interaction between HR and its synthetic derivatives with either ctDNA, d(GC)10 or d(AT)10.As <Figure 2>b depicts and <Table 1> summarises, UV melting data clearly show that each of the ligands stabilises the ctDNA [<22>]. Harmine works better than I and II, although, interestingly, the melting profile of the ctDNA with III exhibits two inflection points.<Figure 3> shows the UV-Vis spectra of both the free and ctDNA-bound ligands, which all intensely absorb in the 240–300 nm region and lesser in the 300–400 nm range. Each experimental ligand-ctDNA spectrum sizeably differs from the corresponding arithmetical ligand-ctDNA sum, highlighting the ligand-ctDNA interaction.Further base-dependent information came from the melting experiments performed with either d(GC)10 (<Figure 4>a) or d(AT)10 (<Figure 4>b). The melting temperatures in the case of d(AT)10 complexes are well detected. On the contrary, the Tm values of the d(GC)10 complexes are invariably higher than 80 °C, but not accurately measured due to the upper heating limit both in the absence and in the presence of the ligands, as already reported in the case with GC sequences in similar experimental conditions [<20>,<21>]. In any case, III clearly makes the most stable complex with the d(GC)10, bearing witness to the key role that the benzyl group at position 3 and/or the fourth ring have in the interaction with GC-rich segments (<Figure 3>a and <Table 1>). In the case of d(AT)10 (<Figure 4>b), the utmost stabilisation was achieved with both I and II, whereas III and HR affect the Tm to a smaller extent. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was also employed for gaining insights into the conformational changes occurring upon β-carboline alkaloids binding to the DNA. <Figure 5>a shows the CD spectra of the ligand-free and ligand-bound ctDNA ([ligand]:[ctDNA]bp). The addition of HR, I or II extensively affects the ctDNA CD spectrum in the 240–300 nm interval, while minor changes occur upon the administration of III. New induced dichroic signals (iCD) arise in the 300–400 nm region purely due to the complex formation, since neither the DNA nor any of the ligands absorb in this range. The iCDs arise in the 300–400 nm range for all the complexes except for the one involving III.The iCD finds root in the transition moments coupling of both the ligand and the surrounding environs by the DNA, that is to say the reciprocal molecular orientation. While the iCD magnitude can hardly be accounted for, its sign relies strongly on the orientation of the ligand with respect to the DNA at the binding site [<23>,<24>]. This means the ligands can intercalate along the DNA axis as they are all oriented in parallel planes or alternately flipped each other. The former case prompts a net CD signal as seen for compounds I and II, whereas the latter might be the case with compound III where positive and negative contributions elide each other.The binding effects of HR, I, II, and III on the CD spectra of d(GC)10 and d(AT)10 are shown in <Figure 5>b,c. The CD spectrum of the d(GC)10 is markedly affected by all the ligands and, again, iCDs in the 300–400 nm region appear, with the exception of the complex made by III.The CD spectrum of d(AT)10 is instead slightly modified by each of the ligands in the 240–340 nm range yet no iCDs are detected in this case (<Figure 5>c). The harmine-derivatives family is very alluring for many purposes, including cancer treatment. The comprehension of the mechanism of action, however, still has blind spots, although the intercalation into DNA duplex is known to be responsible for hampering the DNA replication. Synthetic harmine derivatives were proved to have enhanced antitumor properties according to their molecular geometry and substituents configuration."
PMC6150274_1,"Little is known about the sequence-specific interaction of these compounds with the DNA and harmine was only recently demonstrated to preferentially bind GC-rich segments [<25>] We investigated the interaction of calf thymus DNA and of the d(GC)10 and d(AT)10 20-mer duplexes with both harmine and three of its derivatives (compounds I–III), which recently were proved to have enhanced anticancer activity [<14>].UV-Vis absorption confirms all the ligands to stabilise the ctDNA sequence in the order HR > II > I (<Table 1>). Sequence-specific behaviours were found as the d(AT)10 is greatly stabilised by both I and II (∆Tm = +17 °C) and to a smaller extent by HR and III (∆Tm = +10 and +7 °C, respectively). In contrast, compound III clearly makes the most stable d(GC)10 complex though the upper heating limit, which prevented us from pinpointing the Tm values. This is consistent with previous findings in resembling experimental conditions [<20>,<21>]. In contrast, I and II barely affect the Tm of the GC-rich fragment. Notably, the UV thermal denaturation profile of ctDNA in the presence of compound III exhibits two inflection points. The more complex ctDNA thermal denaturation process as compared to monotonous 20-mer sequences can make this intelligible. The ctDNA features both AT- and GC-rich shuffled segments that undergo differential thermal denaturation. In terms of Tm, compound III has a much weaker effect on AT segments countered by the very strong impact on the GC stretches thereby introducing a massive Tm gap between the two, which detectable by our UV investigation. In contrast, the much smaller behaviour bias that HR, I, and II exhibit towards AT and GC results in narrower Tm splitting, which is conceivably undetectable in a UV melting study, at least in these experimental conditions. Comparable two-inflection UV thermal profile had been reported for a 9-benzyl-substituted harmine derivative compound [<18>].Given these findings, cautious structural consideration can be drawn. Although precise ΔTm are not available for the d(GC)10, the methoxy group position switch from 7 to 4 appears to hinder the d(GC)10 stability while sensibly hardening the d(AT)10 at a comparison of the melting profiles of HR and I reported in <Figure 4>a,b. No stabilising effect to d(AT)10 is appreciable upon addition of the methyl group at position 9, whereas the d(GC)10 thermal profile is perturbed. Anyway, one could hypothesise a DNA pre-melting secondary structure transition as already seen for poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT) duplex [<26>,<27>]. As compared to harmine, the fourth ring with an extra H-bond acceptor, the benzyl group, and the static positive charge featured by III markedly enhance the d(GC)10-selective thermal stabilisation whilst even bearing reduced effectiveness on d(AT)10. Among the harmine derivatives previously addressed, compound III demonstrated the utmost antiproliferative capacity towards PC-3 cells [<14>]. Notably, many DNA-intercalating, anticancer-active drugs have indeed been reported to exhibit preferential binding to GC-rich segments, amid a long-lasting hypothesis of a positive correlation between in vivo antitumor activity and the preferential binding to GC-rich DNA sequences [<28>]. Given these findings and structural observations, III may serve as a hit-compound to start from for advancing the rational design of sequence-specific, DNA-intercalating, and anticancer-active small molecules. The 4-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-pyrido(3,4-b)indole (I), the 4-methoxy-1,9-dimethyl-9H-pyrido(3,4-b)indole (II) and, the 3-benzyl-1-methoxy-6-oxo-6H-indole(3,2,1-de)-(1,5)-naphthyridinin-3-ium (III) were synthesised according to procedures reported elsewhere [<14>]. Harmine and its derivatives were dissolved in DMSO. The calf thymus DNA and the 20-mer oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy) and biomers.net (biomers.net GmbH, Ulm, Germany), respectively. A 1 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA buffer at pH 7.0 was used for dissolving the ctDNA and the d(GC)10, whereas a 40.0 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA buffer at pH 7.0 was used for the d(AT)10. The ctDNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by using the molar extinction coefficient value (λ 260 nm) per base-pairs of 13,200 cm−1 M−1 [<29>]. The 20-mer d(GC)10 and d(AT)10 duplex concentrations were determined by the nearest-neighbour method using molar extinction coefficient values at λ 260 nm of 315,988 and 316,144 cm−1 M−1, respectively [<30>]. The per base-pair concentrations for the d(AT)10 and d(GC)10 were calculated by multiplying by twentyfold those of the respective duplex. MilliQ filtered water was used. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded by using a Jasco V-530 spectrometer (Jasco International Co., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a PTC-348WI thermoelectrically controlled cell holder (Jasco International Co., Tokyo, Japan), at 10 °C for the d(AT)10 and 25 °C for ctDNA and d(GC)10 in the 400–230 nm range using twin quartz cells, 0.1 cm optical path. UV melting experiments were registered at 260 nm in the 25–95 °C range for the d(GC)10 and 10–80 °C for the d(AT)10, temperature ramp 1 °C min−1. The UV melting curves were normalised to the 0–1 range and melting temperatures calculated by first derivative. A Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used for circular dichroism measures by using a 0.1 cm path length cuvette in a Peltier-thermostatted cell holder at both 10 and 25 °C. The scan rate was 20 nm min−1 and bandwidth 2.0 nm. Spectra were collected in the 400–230 nm range and averaged over three collections. rhetorical Figure 1 Chemical structure of harmine (7-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-pyrido(3,4-b)indole), and its synthetic derivatives: I (4-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-pyrido(3,4-b)indole), II (4-methoxy-1,9-dimethyl-9H-pyrido(3,4-b)indole), and III (3-benzyl-1-methoxy-6-oxo-6H-indole[3,2,1-de]-[1,5]-naphthyridinin-3-ium bromide). rhetorical Figure 2 Normalised UV-Vis thermal melting profiles of Calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) at increasing [HR]:[ctDNA]bp ratio (a); and at [ligand]:[ctDNA]bp of 0.50 (b).
