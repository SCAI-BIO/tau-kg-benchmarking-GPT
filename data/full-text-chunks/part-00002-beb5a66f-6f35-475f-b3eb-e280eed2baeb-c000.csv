PMC4555816_0,"The microtubule (MT) plus end–tracking protein TTBK2 phosphorylates kinesin-13 family MT depolymerase KIF2A and removes it from MTs, thereby antagonizing KIF2A-induced depolymerization at MT plus ends during cell migration. Microtubules (MTs) play critical roles in various cellular events, including cell migration. End-binding proteins (EBs) accumulate at the ends of growing MTs and regulate MT end dynamics by recruiting other plus end–tracking proteins (+TIPs). However, how EBs contribute to MT dynamics through +TIPs remains elusive. We focused on tau-tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) as an EB1/3-binding kinase and confirmed that TTBK2 acted as a +TIP. We identified MT-depolymerizing kinesin KIF2A as a novel substrate of TTBK2. TTBK2 phosphorylated KIF2A at S135 in intact cells in an EB1/3-dependent fashion and inactivated its MT-depolymerizing activity in vitro. TTBK2 depletion reduced MT lifetime (facilitated shrinkage and suppressed rescue) and impaired HeLa cell migration, and these phenotypes were partially restored by KIF2A co-depletion. Expression of nonphosphorylatable KIF2A, but not wild-type KIF2A, reduced MT lifetime and slowed down the cell migration. These findings indicate that TTBK2 with EB1/3 phosphorylates KIF2A and antagonizes KIF2A-induced depolymerization at MT plus ends for cell migration. We thank Dr. R.

The authors declare no competing financial interests. The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is essential for various physiological phenomena such as directional cell migration, proliferation, and morphogenesis. Because of their intrinsic polarity, MTs contain two distinct ends: a slowly growing minus end and a rapidly growing plus end (<Desai and Mitchison, 1997>). In cells, MT minus ends are primarily anchored to the MT organizing center and the Golgi apparatus and do not exhibit dynamics (<Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984>; <Efimov et al., 2007>), whereas MT plus ends exhibit stochastic oscillation between phases of growth and shrinkage, defined as dynamic instability (<Desai and Mitchison, 1997>).Several MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT integrity and dynamics. Plus end–tracking proteins (+TIPs), a subclass of MAPs, preferentially accumulate at the growing ends of MTs. An interactive and cooperative framework among +TIPs regulates MT dynamics during cellular events, including cell division and cell migration (<Howard and Hyman, 2007>; <Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008>). The core end-binding proteins (EBs) autonomously accumulate at growing MT plus ends and recruit other +TIPs via interaction with EB-binding domains, the cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich domain, or the SxIP motif (<Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008>; <Honnappa et al., 2009>). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the interactive associations between EBs and regulators of MT growth. During MT polymerization, XMAP215 (chTOG) acts as a processive MT polymerase by facilitating the addition of tubulin to the ends, although it can also catalyze depolymerization (<Shirasu-Hiza et al., 2003>; <Brouhard et al., 2008>). On the other hand, several classes of kinesin families use their catalytic activities to depolymerize MTs. The most studied of these kinesins is the kinesin-13 family, which is composed of KIF2A, 2B, and 2C (mitotic centromere–associated kinesin [MCAK]; <Walczak et al., 2013>). These MT depolymerizers diffusely move along the MT lattice and target to the ends to catalyze tubulin removal from the ends using the energy of ATP hydrolysis (<Desai et al., 1999>; <Hunter et al., 2003>; <Helenius et al., 2006>). Among the members, only MCAK has the SxIP motif and is effectively recruited to MT plus ends by EBs (<Mennella et al., 2005>; <Moore et al., 2005>; <Lee et al., 2008>), possibly promoting the rapid switching of MT dynamics (<Montenegro Gouveia et al., 2010>). Although MT end dynamics are, at least in part, determined by the balance between the activities of the machineries that facilitate MT growth and shrinkage, their interplay is largely not understood.Tau-tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) belongs to the casein kinase I family and was originally identified as a kinase that phosphorylates tau and tubulin (<Ikezu and Ikezu, 2014>). Mutations in the TTBK2 gene are known to cause a neurodegenerative disorder termed spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11), which is characterized by progressive ataxia and atrophy of the cerebellum (<Houlden et al., 2007>). Although the pathogenic mechanism causing SCA11 is not clear, the inherited mutations in TTBK2 generate premature stop codons, resulting in the truncation of TTBK2 immediately after the kinase domain (SCA11-associated form; <Houlden et al., 2007>). In addition, it has been reported that TTBK2 acts as an SxIP-containing +TIP (<Jiang et al., 2012>). However, the role of TTBK2 in MT regulation has yet to be addressed.In this study, we identified the kinesin-13 family MT-depolymerizing kinesin KIF2A as a novel substrate of TTBK2 via a proteomic approach. TTBK2 phosphorylated and inactivated KIF2A in vitro by inhibiting its association with MTs. TTBK2 phosphorylated KIF2A and removed it from MTs in intact cells in an EB-dependent manner. We propose that TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2A and antagonizes KIF2A-induced depolymerization at MT plus ends for cell migration. EB1 and EB3 play crucial roles in recruiting other +TIPs to regulate MT dynamics (<Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008>). We sought to isolate the +TIPs that interact with EB1 and EB3 with a pull-down assay using whole rat brain lysates and mass spectrometry. We identified TTBK1 and TTBK2 as EB-binding proteins (Fig. S1), similar to results reported by others (<Jiang et al., 2012>). Both TTBKs display similar domain organization: a kinase domain at the N terminus and two EB-binding SxIP motifs in the C terminus (<Fig. 1 A>). Then, we characterized the EB3-binding and end-tracking properties of TTBK2. The formation of complexes between TTBKs and EB3 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation (<Fig. 1 B>). A pull-down assay using GST-EB3 demonstrated the common binding properties of the SxIP motifs in TTBK2 (<Fig. 1 C>): EB3 full length (FL) and EB3 Δ3 aa, which lacks the final 3 aa that recognize the cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich domain (<Komarova et al., 2005>; <Mishima et al., 2007>), were associated with monomeric GFP (mGFP)–TTBK2, but this association was diminished after further deletion of the C-terminal region of EB3, which is responsible for its binding to the SxIP motif (<Honnappa et al., 2009>). Furthermore, mutation of both SxIP motifs in TTBK2 almost completely abolished its binding to EB3, although each SxIP motif differentially contributed to EB3 binding (<Fig. 1 D>). Consistently, the accumulation of mGFP-TTBK2 at MT ends was lost when both SxIP motifs were mutated (<Fig. 1 E>). The C-terminal region of TTBK2 (TTBK2-C; <Fig. 1 A>), which harbors the two SxIP motifs, was sufficient for end-tracking (<Fig. 1 F>)."
PMC4555816_1,"In addition, purified mGFP-TTBK2 required EB3 for its accumulation at the growing ends of MTs in vitro (<Fig  1 G>). Collectively, the data indicate that TTBK2 acts as a typical SxIP motif–containing +TIP. rhetorical Figure 1. TTBK2 tracks MT plus ends in an EB-dependent manner.

Horizontal and vertical bars, 5 µm and 50 s, respectively. See Fig. S1 for identification of the TTBKs as EB-binding proteins.

In addition, purified mGFP-TTBK2 required EB3 for its accumulation at the growing ends of MTs in vitro (<Fig. 1 G>). Collectively, the data indicate that TTBK2 acts as a typical SxIP motif–containing +TIP. No functional domains, except for the kinase domain and the SxIP motifs, were found in the TTBK2 amino acid sequence. To gain insight into the functions of TTBK2, we sought to identify TTBK2 substrates. We previously reported the pull-down assay using the affinity beads coated with the kinase domain to isolate substrates (<Amano et al., 2010>). GST-fused TTBK2-cat (Fig. S2 A) was expressed in bacteria and was purified. Using the purified GST–TTBK2-cat proteins, we isolated the TTBK2-cat–interacting proteins from rat brain lysates. Silver staining revealed several candidate binding partners for GST–TTBK2-cat (Fig. S2 B). The selected SDS-PAGE bands (numbered from 1 to 10 in Fig. S2 B) were excised from the gel and processed for mass spectrometry analysis and identification. The identified proteins are listed in Table S1. Among these potential substrates, we focused on the kinesin-13 family MT depolymerase KIF2A because it is possible that TTBK2 regulates MT dynamics through KIF2A (<Desai et al., 1999>; <Homma et al., 2003>). We first confirmed the presence of KIF2A in precipitates of GST–TTBK2-cat. Immunoblot analysis revealed that KIF2A coprecipitated with GST–TTBK2-cat, whereas the closely related protein KIF2C was not detected (Fig. S2 C). When purified KIF2A was incubated with the TTBK2 catalytic domain, TTBK2 efficiently phosphorylated KIF2A under conditions in which RhoGDI was not phosphorylated (<Fig. 2 B, left>). The stoichiometry of KIF2A phosphorylation calculated from three independent experiments was 2.54 ± 0.13. Among the various fragments of KIF2A examined (<Fig. 2 A>), KIF2A-N was predominantly phosphorylated by TTBK2 (<Fig. 2 B, right>), indicating that TTBK2 primarily phosphorylates residues in the N-terminal region of KIF2A. To determine the phosphorylation sites of KIF2A by TTBK2, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of GST–KIF2A-N phosphorylated by TTBK2 in vitro. Several serine or threonine residues were identified as phosphorylation sites (Table S2). Among these residues, S135 exhibited the highest frequency of phosphorylation (Table S2) and is considered to be a main phosphorylation site of KIF2A by TTBK2. S135 is located in the N-terminal region of KIF2A and is conserved among vertebrates (<Fig. 2 C>). Next, we generated an antibody specifically recognizing KIF2A phosphorylated at S135 (anti–pS135-KIF2A antibody). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by in vitro phosphorylation analysis. Purified GST–KIF2A-N–wild type (WT) or -S135A, in which S135 was mutated to alanine, was incubated with TTBK2 in the presence or absence of ATP. The anti–pS135-KIF2A antibody only detected KIF2A-N-WT incubated in the presence of ATP, indicating that the antibody specifically recognizes KIF2A phosphorylated at S135 (<Fig. 2 D>). rhetorical Figure 2.

When TTBK2 was depleted, the phosphorylation of KIF2A at S135 was reduced. The expression of TTBK2-WT in COS-7 cells increased the phosphorylation of exogenous or endogenous KIF2A at S135, whereas that of TTBK2–kinase inactive (KN) K50A (<Bouskila et al., 2011>) did not (<Fig. 2 F> and see <Fig. 5 D>). These results indicate that TTBK2 is responsible for the phosphorylation of KIF2A at S135 in intact cells and that KIF2A is a physiological substrate of TTBK2. Next, we examined whether TTBK2-mediated phosphorylation affects the MT-depolymerizing activity of KIF2A. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated KIF2A were prepared via incubation with TTBK2 in the presence or absence of ATP, respectively, immediately before the depolymerization experiments. Consistent with a previous study (<Desai et al., 1999>), purified KIF2A depolymerized guanosine-5'-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate (GMPCPP)–MTs in a dose-dependent manner (<Fig. 3 A>). Moreover, KIF2A phosphorylation reduced KIF2A activity (∼54.5% and 34.4% reduction at 5-nM and 10-nM KIF2A, respectively). MTs remained detectable in the precipitation fraction of phosphorylated KIF2A (<Fig. 3 A>). The visualization of remnant GMPCPP-MTs after a short exposure to KIF2A demonstrated that TTBK2-mediated phosphorylation indeed inhibited the MT-depolymerizing activity of KIF2A (<Fig. 3 B>). To further address the effects of KIF2A phosphorylation, we examined the association between KIF2A and GMPCPP/taxol-stabilized MTs to minimize KIF2A-mediated depolymerization (<Hertzer et al., 2006>). An assay using a range of MTs demonstrated that KIF2A phosphorylation decreased its binding to MTs (by ∼45.0% and 63.7% at 0.1-µM and 0.5-µM MTs, respectively; <Fig. 3 C>). Collectively, these data show that TTBK2 inhibits the MT-depolymerizing activity of KIF2A by reducing the interaction between KIF2A and MTs. rhetorical Figure 3.

In the search for TTBK2 substrates as described in the previous paragraph, TTBK2 itself was also identified as a TTBK2-cat–interacting protein (Fig. S2 A and Table S1). Several kinases are structured in a closed conformation because of the association between their kinase domain and their pseudosubstrate region. Thus, we examined this possibility. The lysates of COS-7 cells expressing mGFP–TTBK2-FL were subjected to a pull-down assay using GST–TTBK2-cat, -N2, or -M fragments. We found that the kinase domain specifically bound to TTBK2-FL (<Fig. 4 B>). TTBK2-Δcat and -C were associated with GST–TTBK2-cat, but TTBK2-N2, -M, and -ΔC were not (<Fig. 4 C>). These results suggest an intramolecular association between the kinase domain and the C-terminal region of TTBK2. Because the two SxIP motifs in TTBK2-C are responsible for its end-tracking activity (<Fig. 1 E>), we hypothesized that the TTBK2 kinase domain inhibits its end-tracking activity. Supporting our hypothesis, the end-tracking efficiency of TTBK2-FL was less than that of the TTBK2-C fragment (<Fig. 4 D>). Consistently, the expression of mCherry–TTBK2-cat impaired the end-tracking activity of TTBK2-C, but the control mCherry did not (<Fig. 4 E>). The expression of TTBK2-cat increased the percentage of cells exhibiting diffuse localization of TTBK2-C to ∼40% without affecting the accumulation of EB3 at the MT ends (<Fig. 4 E>)."

Consistently, the expression of mCherry–TTBK2-cat impaired the end-tracking activity of TTBK2-C, but the control mCherry did not (<Fig. 4 E>). The expression of TTBK2-cat increased the percentage of cells exhibiting diffuse localization of TTBK2-C to ∼40% without affecting the accumulation of EB3 at the MT ends (<Fig. 4 E>). These results indicate that the TTBK2 kinase domain binds to its C terminus and competes with its binding to EB3. Thus, we next examined whether the association between the TTBK2 kinase domain and its C terminus is interrupted by EB3. We found that purified EB3 specifically inhibited the association between TTBK2-cat and -C in a dose-dependent manner, but the control protein RhoGDI did not (<Fig. 4 F>). This inhibitory effect was not observed for TTBK2-C-m1/2, which lacks EB3-binding ability (<Fig. 1 D> and <Fig. 4 F>). This result suggests that EB3 interacts with TTBK2 and changes its autoinhibitory conformation, thereby liberating the kinase domain. We have shown that TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2A, thereby decreasing its MT-binding activity in vitro. We next investigated how TTBK2 regulates KIF2A localization to MTs in HeLa cells. We used HeLa cells expressing GFP-KIF2A for the analysis because using an anti-GFP antibody enabled us to observe fine changes in KIF2A distribution. The effectiveness of siRNAs targeting TTBK2 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (<Fig. 2 E>). In control cells, KIF2A exhibited diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm, where the overlap of KIF2A with MTs was barely observed (<Fig. 5 A>). When TTBK2 was depleted, KIF2A evidently localized to MTs (<Fig. 5 A>). Another siRNA targeting TTBK2 yielded essentially similar results (unpublished data). To measure the colocalization of GFP-KIF2A and MTs, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Rr) in the peripheral region within 10 µm of the cell edge because we were able to observe clear MT organization in the cell periphery. Theoretical values for this correlation coefficient can range from 1 to −1, where a value of 1 indicates that there is a perfect positive correlation. The calculation showed that TTBK2 depletion significantly increased the correlation of KIF2A with MTs (0.42 in control cells vs. 0.58 in TTBK2-depleted cells; <Fig. 5 C>), indicating that TTBK2 reduces KIF2A localization to MTs. The expression of siRNA-insensitive TTBK2 (resTTBK2)-WT partially reversed the alterations in KIF2A distribution caused by TTBK2 depletion in that the increase in the correlation of KIF2A with MTs was suppressed (<Fig. 5, B and C>). Under these conditions, resTTBK2 mutant defective in EB binding (m1/2) or the KN mutant did not rescue the phenotype (<Fig. 5, B and C>), indicating that the EB-binding activity and kinase activity of TTBK2 are required for the removal of KIF2A from MTs. We then examined whether the EB-binding activity of TTBK2 is required for KIF2A phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis using anti–pS135-KIF2A antibody revealed that expression of TTBK2-WT increased the phosphorylation of KIF2A, but TTBK2-m1/2 or -KN did not increase it (<Fig. 5 D>). These results suggest that TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2A in an EB-dependent manner. To further explore the mechanism by which TTBK2 regulates KIF2A, we monitored KIF2A localization in living HeLa cells. For this experiment, EB3-mRuby was coexpressed with GFP-KIF2A to mark growing MT ends. Cells expressing comparable levels of GFP-KIF2A were selected for analysis. Similar to the results from fixed cells (<Fig. 5 A>), KIF2A in control cells exhibited diffuse distribution and no apparent colocalization with EB3 (<Fig. 5 E> and Video 1). A line profile of growing MT ends showed that in control cells, the intensity of KIF2A was reduced at MT ends where EB3 accumulated (<Fig. 5 F>). In TTBK2-depleted cells, however, KIF2A exhibited filamentous localization that partially overlapped with EB3 (<Fig. 5 E> and Video 2). The line profile demonstrated that TTBK2 depletion increased KIF2A localization to MTs, particularly at the EB3-containing MT ends (<Fig. 5 F>)."

Expression of a SCA11-associated TTBK2 mutant (1284_5delAG or 1329InsA: 1–449 aa or 1–450 aa; <Houlden et al., 2007>), in which TTBK2 is truncated such that two thirds of the protein from the C terminus is lacking, caused extensive KIF2A accumulation at the MTs (<Fig. 5 H> and unpublished data), indicating the dominant-negative effects of these SCA11-associated mutants. Next, we addressed the roles of TTBK2 in regulating MTs by measuring MT dynamics. For this purpose, we used HeLa cells expressing ensconsin MT-binding domain (EMTB)–2xEGFP, which labels MTs (<Faire et al., 1999>). In control HeLa cells, MTs at the cell edge exhibited slowed growth and continuous catastrophe/rescue (<Fig. 6 A> and Video 3). When we plotted the life history of representative MTs, those MTs demonstrated longer lives near the edges, including frequent oscillations between growth and shrinkage (<Fig. 6 B>). Alternatively, the MTs in TTBK2-depleted cells exhibited short lives (<1.5 min in most cases) after a few rescue events (<Fig. 6, A and B>; and Video 4). The quantification of MT dynamics revealed that TTBK2 depletion significantly increased the MT shrink rate (13.0 ± 5.2 µm/min in control cells vs. 19.5 ± 6.1 µm/min in TTBK2-depleted cells) and decreased the rescue (transition from shrinkage to growth) frequency (6.12 ± 2.1 min−1 in control cells vs. 4.30 ± 2.4 min−1 in TTBK2-depleted cells; <Fig. 6 C>). No significant difference was detected in the growth rate or catastrophe (transition from growth to shrinkage) frequency. Conversely, KIF2A depletion increased the rescue frequency (7.88 ± 1.7 min−1; <Fig. 6, A–C>; and Video 5), suggesting that KIF2A has the ability to suppress rescue in the cell peripheral region. Furthermore, changes in MT dynamics caused by TTBK2 depletion were recovered by additional knockdown of KIF2A in TTBK2-depleted cells (<Fig. 6, A–C>; and Video 6)."
PMC4555816_5,"Consistent with the effects of TTBK2 depletion, the cells expressing KIF2A-S135A exhibited increased shrink rates and decreased rescue frequencies compared with cells expressing KIF2A-WT (Fig  S3 and Video 7, Video 8, and Video 9). Collectively, with the changes in KIF2A distribution at MTs caused by TTBK2 depletion, these results indicate the antagonistic effects of the EB–TTBK2 complex on the MT-depolymerizing kinesin KIF2A. rhetorical Figure 6.

Collectively, with the changes in KIF2A distribution at MTs caused by TTBK2 depletion, these results indicate the antagonistic effects of the EB–TTBK2 complex on the MT-depolymerizing kinesin KIF2A. Finally, we examined whether TTBK2 regulates cell migration via KIF2A because appropriate MT dynamics and integrity are required for cell migration (<Watanabe et al., 2005>; <Kuijpers and Hoogenraad, 2011>; <Etienne-Manneville, 2013>). We performed wound healing assays using HeLa cells. The control HeLa cells migrated toward the gap during wound healing, but TTBK2 depletion inhibited this cell migration (<Fig. 7 A>). Tracking of each cell demonstrated the directional and persistent migration of control cells, whereas TTBK2-depleted cells migrated less efficiently, including a loss of directionality toward the wound (<Fig. 7 B>). When quantifying migratory properties (<Fig. 7 C>), control HeLa cells moved at a velocity of 14.1 ± 3.25 µm/h for a total distance of 125 ± 35.8 µm from their original position (n > 150). TTBK2 depletion decreased the velocity to 10.4 ± 3.48 µm/h and the total distance to 77.4 ± 37.4 µm (siTTBK2-1; n > 150). Essentially, similar results were obtained using a different TTBK2 siRNA (unpublished data). The expression of resTTBK2-WT rescued the inhibitory effects of TTBK2 depletion on HeLa cell migration (<Fig. 7 C> and Fig. S4 A), establishing the essential role of TTBK2 in these migratory properties. We then examined the effects of KIF2A depletion on cell migration and found that KIF2A depletion also inhibited the migration (<Fig. 7, B and C>; and Fig. S4 A). TTBK2 and KIF2A double depletion, however, partially rescued the migration defects caused by TTBK2 or KIF2A single depletion (<Fig. 7, B and C>; and Fig. S4 A). Considering that TTBK2 inactivates KIF2A, these results indicate that the proper activity level of KIF2A is required for cell migration, and activities of TTBK2 and KIF2A should be tightly balanced for effective cell migration. rhetorical Figure 7.

PMC4555816_6,"4 µm (siTTBK2-1; n > 150)  Essentially, similar results were obtained using a different TTBK2 siRNA (unpublished data). The expression of resTTBK2-WT rescued the inhibitory effects of TTBK2 depletion on HeLa cell migration (<Fig. 7 C> and Fig. S4 A), establishing the essential role of TTBK2 in these migratory properties. We then examined the effects of KIF2A depletion on cell migration and found that KIF2A depletion also inhibited the migration (<Fig. 7, B and C>; and Fig. S4 A). TTBK2 and KIF2A double depletion, however, partially rescued the migration defects caused by TTBK2 or KIF2A single depletion (<Fig. 7, B and C>; and Fig. S4 A). Considering that TTBK2 inactivates KIF2A, these results indicate that the proper activity level of KIF2A is required for cell migration, and activities of TTBK2 and KIF2A should be tightly balanced for effective cell migration.We next tested the effects of KIF2A-S135A expression on cell migration. The transient expression of GFP–KIF2A-S135A decreased the migration velocity and distance, but the expression of GFP–KIF2A-WT did not (Fig. S4 B), suggesting that TTBK2-mediated phosphorylation of KIF2A at S135 is required for effective cell migration. Furthermore, we examined whether TTBK2 or KIF2A depletion affects MT organization in migrating HeLa cells. A dense MT network was observed at the front of control cells in the wound edge (<Fig. 7 D>). TTBK2 depletion appeared to reduce the density of this MT network. To quantify the MT density at the cell front, we measured the fluorescence intensity of MTs in the region indicated in <Fig. 7 D>. The quantification revealed that the intensity of MTs at the cell front was significantly decreased by TTBK2 depletion, although KIF2A depletion did not affect the intensity. Furthermore, double depletion of TTBK2 and KIF2A recovered the decrease in MT intensity caused by TTBK2 depletion to the levels in control cells (<Fig. 7 D>). This result supports our hypothesis that TTBK2 regulates cell migration through KIF2A inhibition and control of MT dynamics.We examined the involvement of TTBK2 in the migration of cerebellar granule neurons because TTBK2 may be involved in normal cerebellar development and tissue homeostasis (<Houlden et al., 2007>). The cerebellums of mice on postnatal day 5 were electroporated with an shRNA expression vector and mCherry and fixed at postnatal day 7 to monitor the migration of granule neurons from the external granular layer toward the internal granular layer (IGL) through the molecular layer (ML; <Fig. 7 E>). The proportions of migrating neurons in the ML and IGL were significantly decreased after TTBK2 depletion. Two independent shRNAs targeting TTBK2 resulted in similar inhibitory effects (<Fig. 7 E>). Collectively, our results indicate that TTBK2 is generally required for cell migration and that the functional depletion of TTBK2 impairs cerebellar development by affecting cell migration. Based on their crucial interactions with EBs, several +TIPs have been revealed to regulate MT dynamics at the growing MT ends. Our results suggest a new mechanism by which the MT depolymerization is antagonized at MT plus ends. We have shown that a +TIP TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2A and inhibits the binding of KIF2A to MTs, thereby decreasing the MT-depolymerizing activity of KIF2A in vitro (<Fig. 3, A–C>). Cells lacking TTBK2 exhibit extensive KIF2A localization to MTs (<Fig. 5, A and C>). KIF2A phosphorylation and the removal of KIF2A from MTs require the binding of TTBK2 to EBs (<Fig. 5, B–D>). These results suggest that TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2A primarily at growing MT ends and counteracts the depolymerization activity of KIF2A. TTBK2 can weakly localize to the MT lattice (<Fig. 1 E>), where, in addition to the MT ends, EBs can be localized (<Sandblad et al., 2006>; <Maurer et al., 2012>). Thus, TTBK2 possibly phosphorylates KIF2A not only at the MT ends but also on the MT lattice, thereby removing KIF2A from the MT lattice.TTBK2 depletion induces short-lived MTs with an increased shrink rate and a decreased rescue frequency (<Fig. 6>). Conversely, KIF2A depletion increases rescue frequency (<Fig. 6>). The effects of TTBK2 depletion on MT dynamics are reversed by the co-depletion of KIF2A (<Fig. 6>). We also found that TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2C (MCAK), but its inhibitory effects on MT-depolymerizing activity are not vigorous compared with KIF2A (unpublished data). Thus, the EB–TTBK2 axis appears to antagonize the MT-depolymerizing machinery primarily involving KIF2A. Possible reasons for why only the shrink rate and the rescue frequency were affected by TTBK2 depletion include the following explanations. (a) KIF2A association with MTs accelerates MT shrinkage and suppresses rescue, unlike KIF2C, which increases the catastrophe frequency (<Walczak et al., 1996>; <Kline-Smith et al., 2004>). Consistently, KIF2A depletion increased the rescue frequency but did not affect the catastrophe frequency (<Fig. 6>). Indeed, previous studies demonstrated the functional differences among the members of the kinesin-13 family (<Mennella et al., 2005>; <Ohi et al., 2007>; <Walczak et al., 2013>). (b) The EB3–TTBK2 axis removes KIF2A from MTs at the time of the rescue. (c) TTBK2 is not involved in MT growth and catastrophe, and the machinery facilitating MT growth in cells is sufficiently robust even in the presence of KIF2A binding to MT ends; therefore, in the presence of EBs, KIF2A exhibits no depolymerizing activity at MT ends. It cannot be ruled out, however, that other TTBK2 substrates such as MAP2 also play a role in regulating MT dynamics (<Takahashi et al., 1995>). Because phosphorylations of MAPs are generally thought to induce their dissociation from MTs, these phosphorylations may not explain the increase in MT shrink rate caused by TTBK2 depletion. Fully understanding these mechanisms requires further investigation via refined reconstitution assays and high-resolution structural analyses. In their resting states, several kinases form an inactive closed conformation as a result of the association between their kinase domain and a pseudosubstrate sequence. Here, we found that the N-terminal kinase domain of TTBK2 binds to its C-terminal region, which contains tandem SxIP motifs, and inhibits its binding to EBs (<Fig. 4, B, C, and E>). Conversely, EB3 interrupts this association (<Fig. 4 F>). In addition, TTBK2 requires the binding to EBs for its ability to phosphorylate KIF2A and remove it from MTs (<Fig. 5, B–D>). Collectively, we have hypothesized that TTBK2 is in a closed inactive form in the cytoplasm and that the binding to EBs opens it up, thereby activating TTBK2. This mechanism would enable TTBK2 to act specifically at the growing MT plus ends. Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the activation mechanism of TTBK2. The cDNA used in this study was obtained as follows: partial human TTBK1 KIAA1855 (Kazusa DNA Research Institute and Thermo Fisher Scientific), partial human TTBK2 KIAA0847 (Kazusa DNA Research Institute and Invitrogen), human KIF2A (DNAFORM), mCherry (R.

The SxIP motifs were mutated into SxNN as described previously (<Honnappa et al., 2009>). EMTB-2xEGFP was generated based on a previous study (<Faire et al., 1999>) and was used to monitor MT dynamics in cultured cells. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-TTBK1 and anti-TTBK2 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-TTBK1 (from T. Ikezu, Boston University, Boston, MA), anti-KIF2A (Novus Biologicals), anti-GFP (Roche or MBL International), antitubulin (DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich; or YOL 1/34, EMD Millipore), and anti-myc (9E10). The anti–pS135-KIF2A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the phosphopeptide GS(-P)VSDISPVQA (Sigma-Aldrich) and was affinity purified against the phosphopeptide as described previously (<Goto and Inagaki, 2007>). Tubulin and GMPCPP were purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. and Jena Bioscience, respectively. The GST-fused TTBK2 catalytic domain was obtained from Carna Biosciences and was used for the phosphorylation assay. Other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). HeLa cells expressing GFP-KIF2A were provided by R. Uehara (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan) and maintainedas described previously (<Uehara et al., 2013>). The transfection of HeLa cells was performed using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) for siRNA and Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) for transient plasmid transfection. COS-7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the rescue experiment using the wound healing assay, HeLa cells expressing siRNA-insensitive GFP–TTBK2-FL were generated using the piggyback transposon system (System Biosciences), followed by FACS (Aria; BD) analysis to isolate the GFP-positive cell population. This pooled cell population was used for the rescue experiment. Recombinant GST-fused proteins were produced in Escherichia coli (XL-1 blue, BL21DE3, or RosettaDE3) using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and were purified as described previously (<Wang et al., 2012>; <Kakeno et al., 2014>). To produce GST, GST-EB1, and GST-EB3, we used pGEX (GE Healthcare). For other GST-fused proteins (EB3 1–251 aa, EB3 Δ3 aa, TTBK2 fragments, and KIF2A fragments), we used pDEST15 (Invitrogen), which contains a 13-aa linker region between GST tag and cloning sites. His-fused KIF2A-FL was expressed in Sf9 cells and was purified based on a previous study (<Maney et al., 1998>) using HisTrap and an Akta purifier (GE Healthcare). All of the protein purification procedures were performed at 4°C. The end-tracking assay was performed as previously described (<Kakeno et al., 2014>). Flow chambers (22 mm wide × 1 mm high × 0.15 mm deep) were assembled between a coverslip and a precleaned glass microslide using double-sided tape. The silanized glass coverslip was coated with antibiotin (1% in MRB80; Invitrogen), and the nonspecific surface was blocked with Pluronic F127 (1% in MRB80; Invitrogen). Biotinylated MT seeds (50-µM tubulin solution containing 10% biotinylated tubulin, 10% rhodamine-labeled tubulin, and 1-mM GMPCPP) were specifically attached to the functionalized surface via biotinylated tubulin–antibiotin interactions. After the chamber was washed with MRB80, MT growth was initiated by perfusing 15-µM tubulin (containing 3.2% rhodamine-labeled tubulin) and 25-nM FLAG–mGFP-TTBK2 from mammalian cells with or without 400-nM EB3 into the assay buffer (MRB80, 75-mM KCl, 1-mM GTP, 0.5 mg/ml κ-casein, and 0.1% methylcellulose; Sigma-Aldrich) and an oxygen scavenger system (50-mM glucose, 400 µg/ml glucose oxidase, 200 µg/ml catalase, and 4-mM DTT). The samples were sealed using candle wax. During the experiments, the samples were maintained at 25 ± 1°C. Images were collected every 3 s for 2.5 min via total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy using a microscope (TE2000E; Nikon), a camera (iXonEM+ 897; Andor Technology), a 100× 1.49 NA objective, and a 488/561-nm excitation laser (Melles Griot). The microscopes were controlled using Micro-Manager software (Vale laboratory, University of California, San Francisco). Kymographs were generated for MT seeds using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For the pull-down assay, transfected COS-7 cells were washed with PBS and lysed using buffer A (20-mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 50-mM NaCl, 5-mM MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). After removing debris via centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with glutathione beads coated with 200 pmol of the GST-fused protein for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with buffer A and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. For the immunoprecipitation assay, appropriate antibodies and protein A–Sepharose (GE Healthcare) were used instead of the GST-fused protein and the glutathione beads. To identify interacting molecules, rat brain lysates were used. The entire adult rat brain, except for the cerebellum, was lysed using buffer B (50-mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 150-mM NaCl, 5-mM MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). The GST-fused proteins were used at 500 pmol. The kinase assay was performed in 50 µl kinase buffer C (50-mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5-mM MgCl2, 1-mM DTT, and 200 µM ATP) containing 6.2-nM recombinant GST-TTBK2 catalytic domain (Carna Biosciences) or 10-nM GFP–TTBK2-FL (homemade), a substrate (80-nM KIF2A-FL or 160-nM KIF2A fragments), and 0.1-mM γ-[32P]ATP. After incubation for 30 min at 30°C, the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The radiolabeled bands were visualized using an image analyzer (Typhoon FLA 9000; GE Healthcare). To prepare phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated KIF2A for the biochemical experiments, purified KIF2A was incubated with recombinant GST-TTBK2 catalytic domain for 30 min at 30°C in the presence or absence of ATP, respectively. The buffer conditions and the kinase concentration were the same as described in the kinase assay. After the incubation, the reaction mixtures were immediately subjected to MT depolymerization assays or MT cosedimentation assays. GMPCPP-tubulin was prepared by cycling tubulin polymerization in the presence of 1-mM GMPCPP based on a previous study (<Stumpff et al., 2007>). In brief, 20-µM tubulin was incubated in 1-mM GMPCPP on ice for 10 min and then polymerized at 37°C for 30 min. Polymerized tubulin was pelleted at 150,000 g at 25°C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 20 µM. Then, tubulin was further cycled once in the presence of 1-mM GMPCPP. MT depolymerization assays were performed using a previously described method (<Hertzer et al., 2006>). GMPCPP-MTs at 1 µM in buffer D (80-mM K-Pipes, pH 6.9, 1-mM MgCl2, 1-mM EGTA, 2-mM Mg-ATP, 1-mM DTT, and 50-mM KCl) were incubated in KIF2A at 22°C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 350,000 g at 22°C for 10 min. To visualize the MTs, the MT-depolymerizing reaction was stopped after 5 min of incubation by adding glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 1%. The mixture was sedimented onto coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine, postfixed in methanol, rehydrated, blocked with BSA, and processed for immunofluorescence using an antitubulin antibody. To identify the EB- or TTBK2-interacting proteins, the obtained eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE and were subjected to silver staining using SilverQuest (Invitrogen). Each band of interest was excised from the gel. These proteins were reduced, S-carboxymethylated, and digested using trypsin."
PMC4555816_8,"The digested peptide fragments were subjected to nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis using a mass spectrometer (Finnigan LTQ/Orbitrap; Thermo Fisher Scientific) combined with an HPLC system (Paradigm MS4; Michrom BioResources, Inc ). To identify the TTBK2-mediated phosphorylation sites on KIF2A, purified GST–KIF2A-N was subjected to a nonradioactive phosphorylation assay using TTBK2 and then precipitated using glutathione beads. The precipitated samples were eluted with guanidine solution (50-mM NH4HCO3 and 7-M guanidine-HCl). The eluates were subjected to reduction, alkylation, demineralization, and peptide enrichment, followed by digestion using trypsin. The phosphopeptides were enriched using the Titansphere Phos-TiO kit (GL Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a mass spectrometry system (Q Exactive; Thermo Fisher Scientific) combined with an ultra HPLC system (Nano-Advance; Bruker-Michrom, Inc.). The raw data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the Sequest algorithm at a precursor mass accuracy of 15 ppm and a tandem mass spectrometry tolerance of 0.02 D. The peptide search was performed against the UniProtKB Homo sapiens reference proteome dataset (release 2012_10) using a 1% false discovery rate threshold. The most likely phosphorylation site was determined using the PhosphoRS algorithm within the Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HeLa cells were fixed using methanol for 10 min at −30°C followed by postfixation using 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT. The cells were blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at RT and incubated in the primary antibody for 1 h at RT. The secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488–, 555–, and 647–conjugated antibodies against mouse, rabbit, or rat IgG (Invitrogen). Confocal images were recorded using a microscope (Axiovert Observer LSM780; Carl Zeiss) equipped with Plan Apochromat 63× 1.40 NA and Plan Apochromat 100× 1.40 NA objectives under the control of Zen software (Carl Zeiss). For live imaging of GFP-KIF2A and EB3-mRuby, cells were observed at 37°C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% FBS using an LSM780 microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat 40× 1.40 NA objective. Images were acquired in λ mode at 2.09-s intervals for 3.5 min and then processed with the linear unmixing function of Zen software to unmix the GFP and mRuby spectra. For dynamic detection of +TIPs in living cells, the cells were observed at 37°C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% FBS or CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) using an inverted microscope (IX-81; Olympus) equipped with a Plan Apo 60× 1.42 NA oil objective and a camera (iXonEM+ DV885; Andor Technology) under the control of MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). We used filter sets from Semrock (GFP-3035B and TxRed-4040C). The images were processed using LSM Zen (Carl Zeiss), ImageJ, and MetaMorph software. To calculate the correlation coefficient of GFP-KIF2A and MTs at the cell periphery, the region within 10 µm of the cell edge was defined using MetaMorph software as follows. After subtracting the background, the cell outline was manually traced, and the region was shrunk to a 10-µm distance from the cell edge to create the inner region. The area outside the inner region and within the cell outline was used for the analysis. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated using ImageJ. For the analysis of MT dynamics, cells expressing EMTB-2xEGFP were transfected with the indicated siRNA. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were observed at 37°C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% FBS using an LSM780 microscope. The cells were imaged at 2.19-s intervals for 3.65 min. To measure the MT dynamics, life history plots of MTs were generated and analyzed as previously described (<Li et al., 2011>). At 24 h after siRNA transfection, the HeLa cells were reseeded on the culture inserts (ibidi). During wound healing, the cells were imaged at 10-min intervals for 12 h using an inverted microscope (IX-81) equipped with a UPlan SApo 10× 0.40 NA objective in the presence of L-15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS. Before collecting the images, the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 at 0.3 µg/ml for 30 min. The movement of each nucleus was determined via object tracking using MetaMorph software. In <Fig. 7>, the migration distance is expressed as the direct distance from the original position. The directionality was calculated as the migration distance divided by the total track distance in accordance with a previous study (<Pegtel et al., 2007>). For the observation of MT organization during wound healing, cells were incubated for 6 h after removing the culture insert and then fixed with methanol for 10 min at −30°C, followed by immunostaining with an antitubulin antibody (YOL 1/34). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. MT density at the cell front was measured as the mean intensity in the region indicated in <Fig. 7 D>. Single-plane images focused on the cell periphery were used for the analysis. Animals were handled in accordance with guidelines established by Nagoya University and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry. Postnatal day 5 ICRmice were anesthetized on ice and injected with plasmid DNA. 2 µl of plasmid DNA (mixture of 1.0 mg/ml pSico-shRNA and 0.5 mg/ml pCAG-mCherry) in TE buffer (10-mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1-mM EDTA) containing Fast green were injected into the interlobular space between lobules V and VI using a glass micropipette (G-1.0; Narishige). After the injection, forceps-type electrodes were placed on the occipital regions, and 50-ms electronic pulses of 80 mV were delivered seven times at intervals of 150 ms using an electroporator (CUY21; Nepa Gene). The pups were revived at 37°C and returned to the litter. The brains were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde at 48 h after electroporation, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS, and then sectioned into 40-µm-thick sagittal slices using a cryostat (CM3050S; Leica). Immunofluorescence was performed according to a previous study (<Seto et al., 2014>). In brief, the sections were blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 at RT for 1 h and subsequently incubated in an anti-RFP antibody (MBL International) in blocking buffer at 4°C for 20 h. The specimens were subsequently rinsed with PBS and incubated in an Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated anti–rabbit IgG antibody and in DAPI at RT for 2 h.

Fig. S2 shows the identification of TTBK2-interacting proteins by a proteomics approach and the presence of KIF2A in GST–TTBK2-cat precipitates. Fig. S3 shows the effects of KIF2A-S135A expression on MT dynamics. Fig. S4 shows representative images of HeLa cells during wound healing under the conditions indicated in <Fig. 7> and demonstrates the effects of KIF2A-S135A expression on cell migration. Videos 1 and 2 show the live imaging of GFP-KIF2A in a control cell and the TTBK2-depleted cell, respectively.

The microtubule (MT) plus end–tracking protein TTBK2 phosphorylates kinesin-13 family MT depolymerase KIF2A and removes it from MTs, thereby antagonizing KIF2A-induced depolymerization at MT plus ends during cell migration."
PMC4555816_9,"Microtubules (MTs) play critical roles in various cellular events, including cell migration  End-binding proteins (EBs) accumulate at the ends of growing MTs and regulate MT end dynamics by recruiting other plus end–tracking proteins (+TIPs). However, how EBs contribute to MT dynamics through +TIPs remains elusive. We focused on tau-tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) as an EB1/3-binding kinase and confirmed that TTBK2 acted as a +TIP. We identified MT-depolymerizing kinesin KIF2A as a novel substrate of TTBK2. TTBK2 phosphorylated KIF2A at S135 in intact cells in an EB1/3-dependent fashion and inactivated its MT-depolymerizing activity in vitro. TTBK2 depletion reduced MT lifetime (facilitated shrinkage and suppressed rescue) and impaired HeLa cell migration, and these phenotypes were partially restored by KIF2A co-depletion. Expression of nonphosphorylatable KIF2A, but not wild-type KIF2A, reduced MT lifetime and slowed down the cell migration. These findings indicate that TTBK2 with EB1/3 phosphorylates KIF2A and antagonizes KIF2A-induced depolymerization at MT plus ends for cell migration. ."
PMC4009424_0,"Tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) belongs to casein kinase superfamily and phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein tau and tubulin. TTBK has two isoforms, TTBK1 and TTBK2, which contain highly homologous catalytic domains but their non-catalytic domains are distinctly different. TTBK1 is expressed specifically in the central nervous system and is involved in phosphorylation and aggregation of tau. TTBK2 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues and genetically linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 11. TTBK1 directly phosphorylates tau protein, especially at Ser422, and also activates cycline-dependent kinase 5 in a unique mechanism. TTBK1 protein expression is significantly elevated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains, and genetic variations of the TTBK1 gene are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease in two cohorts of Chinese and Spanish populations. TTBK1 transgenic mice harboring the entire 55-kilobase genomic sequence of human TTBK1 show progression of tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration when crossed with tau mutant mice. Our recent study shows that there is a striking switch in mononuclear phagocyte and activation phenotypes in the anterior horn of the spinal cord from alternatively activated (M2-skewed) microglia in P301L tau mutant mice to pro-inflammatory (M1-skewed) infiltrating peripheral monocytes by crossing the tau mice with TTBK1 transgenic mice. TTBK1 is responsible for mediating M1-activated microglia-induced neurotoxicity, and its overexpression induces axonal degeneration in vitro. These studies suggest that TTBK1 is an important molecule for the inflammatory axonal degeneration, which may be relevant to the pathobiology of tauopathy including AD. We would like to thank Drs. Shinji Sato, Satoshi Okuyama, Jixing Xu, Kaitlin Ingraham, Libin Cui, Maya Woodbury, and Hirohide Asai for your work on these studies. The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is a physiological component of the microtubule architecture of neuronal axons (<Weingarten et al., 1975>). Hyperphosphorylated tau protein (pTau) is a principal component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are a hallmark of tauopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; <Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986>; <Wolozin et al., 1986>; <Iqbal et al., 1989>). The human tau gene is segregated to a rare form of familial FTD with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), demonstrating MAPT as a causative gene of neurodegenerative disorders (<Hong et al., 1998>; <Hutton et al., 1998>). The mechanism of NFT formation is centered around tau phosphorylation, mono-ubiquitination, and conformational changes of the protein from highly extended native form to paired helical filament (<Ihara et al., 1986>; <Kosik et al., 1986>). pTau found in NFT suggests that there is an imbalance between the tau kinase and phosphatase activities or some dysfunction in the clearance of pTau in affected human brain (<Takashima et al., 1995>; <Gong et al., 2000>; <Jinwal et al., 2013>). Tau protein is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3β) and cycline-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5; <Ishiguro et al., 1991>, <1992>; <Arioka et al., 1993>; <Takashima et al., 1993>). GSK3β and Cdk5 are suspected to play a major role in pathological phosphorylation of tau in the brain. As such, large efforts have been made to develop inhibitors toward these kinases (<Brunden et al., 2010>). One of the main disadvantages of targeting such kinases is their ubiquitous expression in multiple peripheral tissues, which warrants serious unwanted side effects. Brain-specific tau kinases are attractive targets for ameliorating the phosphorylation status of tau protein. Through the complementary DNA library screening of brain-specific kinases, we have identified tau-tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1), which is uniquely expressed in neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and can phosphorylate tau protein (<Sato et al., 2006>). The TTBK family consists of TTBK1 (1321 a.a.; <Sato et al., 2006>) and TTBK2 (1244 a.a.; <Houlden et al., 2007>). These two kinases belong to the casein kinase 1 (CK1) group, which contains CK1 (α1, α2, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, and ε), TTBK (1 and 2), and vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) 1–3 (Figure <1A>; <Manning et al., 2002>; <Sato et al., 2006>). CK1δ can phosphorylate tau in cultured cells and is known to be up-regulated in AD brain (<Li et al., 2004>). The alignment of the kinase domain of TTBK1 and CK1δ shows 38% identity and 52% similarity (<Sato et al., 2006>); therefore, TTBK1 is the closest relative of CK1, but not a member of CK1 family. The catalytic domain of TTBK1 is conserved in vertebrates, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster (Figure <1B>). TTBK1 and TTBK2 amino acid sequences are 60% identical and 71% similar in the TTBK1 14–577 and TTBK2 1–589 regions. Their kinase domains (TTBK1 35–294 and TTBK2 21–280) are highly homologous (88% identity and 96% similarity). The rest of the sequences have no homology except a small domain (TTBK1 1053–1117 and TTBK2 942–1006 with 43% identity and 58% similarity). TTBK1 and TTBK2 are distinctly conserved among vertebrates from zebrafish (D. rerio) to human (Figure <1C>). However, TTBK homologs in C. elegans (TTBK), C. capitata (TTBK1), and D. melanogaster (ASATOR) only conserve the catalytic domain of TTBK1 or TTBK2 (Figure <1C>). Since the catalytic domain of TTBK1 and TTBK2 are highly homologous, this suggests that TTBK1 and TTBK2 genes are diversified from a common shorter TTBK gene during the evolution from invertebrates to vertebrates. rhetorical FIGURE 1 Dendrogram of CK1 group and sequence conservation of TTBK1.

PMC4009424_1,"2, and consisted with nine exons and 10 introns with a complementary DNA (cDNA) length of 6192bp  TTBK2 was previously extracted from bovine and mouse brain as a 36 kDa protein, and it phosphorylates tau protein at Ser208 and Ser210 (<Takahashi et al., 1995>; <Tomizawa et al., 2001>). TTBK2 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, such as placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, heart, and brain. There is especially higher expression in the Purkinje cells and granular cell layer of the cerebellum, hippocampus, midbrain and substantia nigra (<Houlden et al., 2007>), on the other hand, lower expression is shown in the cortex. At a protein level, TTBK2 is highly expressed in brain and testis, which corresponds to the elevated kinase activity in these tissues (<Bouskila et al., 2011>).A recombinant kinase domain of mouse TTBK2 corresponds to human TTBK2 1–316 residues (98% identity), and the kinase domain (residues 1–331) of human TTBK2 was expressed in insect cells with a baculovirus overexpression system and crystallized (<Kitano-Takahashi et al., 2007>). Diffraction data were collected to 2.9 Å resolution, but so far no publication is available for the structural information. Consensus phosphorylation sites for CK1 isoforms is S/Tp-X-X-S/T, where S/Tp refers to a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine: X refers to any amino acid and the underlined residues refer to the target site (<Flotow and Roach, 1989>; <Flotow et al., 1990>; <Nakielny et al., 1991>). The priming phosphorylation site is at the -3 position in the case of CK1. However, the preferred priming phosphorylation site is the tyrosine residue at the +2 position for TTBK2 (S/T-X-Yp), and either serine or threonine residue on the +2 position rather diminish the priming effect (<Bouskila et al., 2011>).Multiple biological functions of TTBK2 have recently been identified: TTBK2 is critical in the initiation of ciliogenesis, which is important for sonic hedgehog developmental pathway (<Goetz et al., 2012>; <Tanos et al., 2013>; <Ye et al., 2014>). TTBK2 may also play a role in mitosis: Asator, a TTBK2 homolog in Drosophila, is localized in the mitotic spindle and directly interacts with the spindle matrix protein Megator (<Qi et al., 2009>). TTBK2 may also be involved in anti-cancer drug resistance: TTBK2 increases the cell surface number of sodium-coupled glucose transporter (SLC5A1) in cancer cells and confers cell survival against anti-cancer drugs (<Almilaji et al., 2013>). These studies indicate the diverse functions of TTBK2 in embryogenesis, mitosis and cell survival (Table <1>). Further studies will be necessary for characterizing the function of TTBK2 in the CNS.

(2013) Summary of TTBK family. The human TTBK2 gene (Gene ID: 146057) is positioned on chromosome 15q15.2, and consisted with nine exons and 10 introns with a complementary DNA (cDNA) length of 6192bp. TTBK2 was previously extracted from bovine and mouse brain as a 36 kDa protein, and it phosphorylates tau protein at Ser208 and Ser210 (<Takahashi et al., 1995>; <Tomizawa et al., 2001>). TTBK2 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, such as placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, heart, and brain. There is especially higher expression in the Purkinje cells and granular cell layer of the cerebellum, hippocampus, midbrain and substantia nigra (<Houlden et al., 2007>), on the other hand, lower expression is shown in the cortex. At a protein level, TTBK2 is highly expressed in brain and testis, which corresponds to the elevated kinase activity in these tissues (<Bouskila et al., 2011>).A recombinant kinase domain of mouse TTBK2 corresponds to human TTBK2 1–316 residues (98% identity), and the kinase domain (residues 1–331) of human TTBK2 was expressed in insect cells with a baculovirus overexpression system and crystallized (<Kitano-Takahashi et al., 2007>). Diffraction data were collected to 2.9 Å resolution, but so far no publication is available for the structural information. Consensus phosphorylation sites for CK1 isoforms is S/Tp-X-X-S/T, where S/Tp refers to a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine: X refers to any amino acid and the underlined residues refer to the target site (<Flotow and Roach, 1989>; <Flotow et al., 1990>; <Nakielny et al., 1991>). The priming phosphorylation site is at the -3 position in the case of CK1. However, the preferred priming phosphorylation site is the tyrosine residue at the +2 position for TTBK2 (S/T-X-Yp), and either serine or threonine residue on the +2 position rather diminish the priming effect (<Bouskila et al., 2011>).Multiple biological functions of TTBK2 have recently been identified: TTBK2 is critical in the initiation of ciliogenesis, which is important for sonic hedgehog developmental pathway (<Goetz et al., 2012>; <Tanos et al., 2013>; <Ye et al., 2014>). TTBK2 may also play a role in mitosis: Asator, a TTBK2 homolog in Drosophila, is localized in the mitotic spindle and directly interacts with the spindle matrix protein Megator (<Qi et al., 2009>). TTBK2 may also be involved in anti-cancer drug resistance: TTBK2 increases the cell surface number of sodium-coupled glucose transporter (SLC5A1) in cancer cells and confers cell survival against anti-cancer drugs (<Almilaji et al., 2013>). These studies indicate the diverse functions of TTBK2 in embryogenesis, mitosis and cell survival (Table <1>). Further studies will be necessary for characterizing the function of TTBK2 in the CNS. Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by poor coordination, abnormal eye movements, impairment of speech and swallowing, and pyramidal signs (<Schols et al., 2004>). Almost all affected individuals show cerebellar atrophy when tested by MRI. SCA11 is a pure progressive cerebellar ataxia that has been genetically linked to human chromosome 15q14–21 (<Worth et al., 1999>). The mean age of onset for the disease is 24.2 ± 8.4 years, ranging from 15–43. SCA11 is an autosomal dominant form of cerebellar ataxia and so far two families have been identified: a Caucasian family that traces its earliest known British ancestry to the 19th century and another of Pakistani ancestry, with five affected individuals present over three generations (Figure <2A>; <Houlden et al., 2007>; <Johnson et al., 2008>). Both families show genetically linked mutations in the TTBK2 gene, with the Caucasian family having a one-base insertion of an adenosine in exon 13 at nucleotide 1329 (codon 444), creating a premature stop site (TGA) in the mRNA at codon 450 and truncating the normal protein from 1,244 to 450 amino acids (Figure <2B>, 1329InsA). The same mutation was also found in another case of SCA11 by next generation sequencing (<Németh et al., 2013>). The Pakistani family was associated with a frameshift deletion of two bases (GA) in exon 13 of TTBK2 at nucleotides 1284/1285, codons 428 and 429, creating a premature stop site (TGA) in the mRNA at codon 449 (Figure <2B>, 1284/85DelAG). Transient expression study shows that SCA11-linked mutations of TTBK2 dramatically reduce the kinase activity to 10% of full-length TTBK2 and promote their nuclear localization (<Bouskila et al., 2011>). TTBK2-1329InsA-knockin mice also show reduced kinase activity in vivo (<Bouskila et al., 2011>). Since kinase-negative TTBK2 mutant also shows nuclear localization, the reduction of kinase activity and autophosphorylation may regulate its subcellular localization. The effect of TTBK2 nuclear localization on neurotoxicity is unknown. These mutations have no effect on the half-life of expressed TTBK2 proteins, which is approximately 24 h (<Bouskila et al., 2011>). rhetorical FIGURE 2 Pedigrees of SCA11 families 1 and 2."

The effect of TTBK2 nuclear localization on neurotoxicity is unknown. These mutations have no effect on the half-life of expressed TTBK2 proteins, which is approximately 24 h (<Bouskila et al., 2011>).Neuropathological examination with TTBK2 mutated brain also had been carried out (<Houlden et al., 2007>). The brain macroscopically showed intense atrophy of the cerebellum. Microscopically, severe and almost complete loss of Purkinje cells and a significant loss of cerebellar granule cells have been shown. The medullary tegmentum, nigra, midbrain tegmentum and putamen presented NFTs, neuropil threads and tau-positive neuritis. Pre-tangles and NFTs, as well as oligodendrocyte tau-positive filamentous inclusions, were found in the globus pallidus. There also exist pathological aging, sparse tangles and β-amyloid-positive plaques in the neocortex, hippocampus, and transentorhinal, entorhinal, and insular cortices. No plaques were present in the cerebellum. Although the brain that has the TTBK2 mutation (codon 444) showed cell loss in the cerebellum, there is no other visible pathology (<Houlden et al., 2007>). Therefore, the degree of TTBK2 gene expression did not associate with pathology in the cerebellum although the gene was highly expressed.TTBK2 truncation mutations found in the SCA11 families resulted in a shorter half-life of mRNA as compared to wild-type TTBK2 mRNA, suggesting the reduction in expression of TTBK2 by the mutations (<Houlden et al., 2007>). <Kraemer et al. (2006)> reported the role of TTBK2 in the tau pathway using RNA interference experiments in C. elegans. Treating worms with short interfering RNA to a C. elegans homolog of TTBK2 (TTBK) in the presence of an FTDP-17 mutant tau transgene enhanced the uncoordinated movement phenotype (dyskinesia). Taken together, these data suggest that reduction in TTBK2 expression levels may accelerate tau-related pathogenesis. In accord, TTBK2-knockin mice expressing an SCA11 disease-causing mutation show the reduction of endogenous TTBK2 kinase activity (<Bouskila et al., 2011>). The SCA11 mutation homozygosity causes lethality at embryonic day 10. These studies demonstrate that SCA11-linked TTBK2 mutation is a loss-of-function mutation and the TTBK2 gene is essential in embryogenesis. This is consistent with the recent series of ciliogenesis studies on TTBK2 knockout mice (<Goetz et al., 2012>; <Tanos et al., 2013>; <Ye et al., 2014>).In addition to the two reported mutations on TTBK2 in SCA11 cases, a recent study also identified 1306_1307delGA mutation in exon 2 of one German and one French SCA11 cases (<Bauer et al., 2010>). This also leads to the premature stop codon after the catalytic domain sequence. Three additional missense mutations were found in SCA11 cases (L8P, E842G, and R1110H; <Edener et al., 2009>). However, these mutations are outside of the catalytic domain and also reported in the 1000 Genomes project, suggesting them as common variants. In addition, recent 1000 Genomes project identified a total of 12,708 somatic variations in human TTBK2 gene, including 301 missense variants, 11 stop-gained variants, 17 frameshift variants, 32 splicing variants, 30 5′UTR variants, and 83 3′UTR variants. This results in seven different splicing variants of TTBK2 genes (TTBK2-1, TTBK2-2, TTBK2-3, TTBK2-7, TTBK2-6, TTBK-8, and TTBK2-5) and 6 different amino acid sequences (TTBK2-5 has no protein product), whose lengths are 1244, 478, 443, 117, 143 and 84, respectively. Only TTBK2-1, TTBK2-2, and TTBK2-3 genes encode the catalytic domain. Interestingly, among the 11 stop-gained variants, six are terminated at Glu19 (MSGGGEQPDILSVGILVKE/*), suggesting the somatic loss-of-function mutation. Although none of the somatic loss-of-function mutations is linked to human diseases, these data suggest that TTBK2 loci are highly susceptible to somatic mutations and may be associated with human diseases related to cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. Human TTBK1 gene (Gene ID: 84630), which we originally cloned, is positioned on chromosome 6p21.1 and consists of 14 exons and 15 introns with a cDNA length of 6932bp (<Sato et al., 2006>). The TTBK1 protein (UniProt ID: Q5TCY1) consists of 1,321 amino acids and has a kinase domain and a polyglutamate domain in the middle region of the sequence (Figure <1B>). TTBK1 isoform2 was also recently identified (TTBK1–2, UniProt ID: Q5TCY1–2), which consists of 621 amino acids and share amino acids 52–540 and 1194–1229 of isoform1. Since isoform2 lacks in the N-terminal region of the consensus kinase domain, it likely has no kinase activity. TTBK1 mRNA was detected in cortex and cerebellum, and in fetal brain (<Sato et al., 2006>). In situ hybridization study on mouse brains detected strong expression of TTBK1 gene expression in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, perinuclear, and cytoplasmic regions of the large cortical pyramidal cell in the temporal cortex, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum (<Sato et al., 2006>). Recent independent studies also confirm the specific expression of TTBK1 mRNA in neuronal layers of human brain as determined by in situ hybridization (<Lund et al., 2013>). Immunohistochemistry of human brain with several TTBK1 antibodies produced particularly strong granular staining in the apical and basal dendrites and in deposits in the neuronal cell soma.Tau-tubulin kinase 1 protein expression is significantly upregulated in AD brains (<Sato et al., 2008>)."
PMC4009424_3,"Immunohistochemical analysis of AD brains shows that TTBK1 co-localizes with pSer422-positive pre-tangles but not with thioflavin-S-positive NFTs (<Lund et al , 2013>). pSer422 antibody identifies a rare population of AT8-unlabeled neurons, which scatter throughout the hippocampal formation and the entorhinal cortex. These data suggest that TTBK1 may play a significant role in pre-tangle formation by tau phosphorylation at Ser422 in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. This is in line with a previous report claiming that Ser422 becomes phosphorylated earlier in the development of an NFT, preferentially marking intracellular NFTs (<Augustinack et al., 2002>).In addition, genetic variations of the TTBK1 gene (SNPs rs2651206, rs10807287, and rs7764257) are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) in two large cohorts of Spanish and Chinese populations (<Vazquez-Higuera et al., 2011>; <Yu et al., 2011>), further validating the importance of the TTBK1 gene in the development of tauopathy and AD pathogenesis (<Cuny, 2009>). These findings are summarized in Table <1>. Recent 1000 Genomes project identified a total of 1,650 variations in human TTBK1 gene, including 194 missense variants, five stop-gained variants, nine frameshift variants, 23 splicing variants, 8 5′UTR variants, and 32 3′UTR variants. The number of TTBK1 variants was much smaller than that of TTBK2 variants. The five stop variants are terminated at Arg650, Arg599, Gln686, Glu753, and Ser1067. All of them still encode the catalytic domain and are possibly gain-of-function mutations, since shorter amino acid sequences are generally more efficient in protein translations. These data suggest that more genetic associations to TTBK1 gene may be found in human diseases. Tau-tubulin kinase 1 directly phosphorylates itself, tau and tubulin. Furthermore, we determined the exact human tau 40 (htau40) phosphorylation sites in vitro by phosphopeptide mapping with liquid chromatography and tandem mass-spectrometry (LC/MS/MS; <Sato et al., 2006>). The htau40 phosphorylation at Tyr197, Ser198, Ser199, Ser202 and Ser422, which have all been reported as phosphorylation sites in PHF-tau (<Iqbal et al., 1989>; <Morishima-Kawashima et al., 1995a>, <b>; <Hanger et al., 1998>; <Vega et al., 2005>). These results show that TTBK1 is a critical tau protein kinase for the phosphorylation of PHF-specific sites. Direct phosphorylation of Ser422 and AT8 epitopes (Ser202 and Thr205) by TTBK1 was also independently demonstrated (<Lund et al., 2013>). pSer422 is a very specific marker for pathological PHF-tau, since little phosphorylation is present in the normal adult brain (<Hasegawa et al., 1996>). TTBK1 is one of the few kinases, along with the microtubule-associated protein kinases, that can phosphorylate tau protein at Ser422 (<Reynolds et al., 1997>; <Sato et al., 2002>, <2006>).For the crystallography of TTBK1, TTBK1 (1–313) and (14–313) fragments were expressed in E. coli and insect cells, which were found as multi-phosphorylated forms (<Xue et al., 2013>). To avoid this problem, TTBK1 protein was co-expressed with lambda phosphatase, by which TTBK1 was dephosphorylated and was subsequently co-crystallized with two high-affinity ATP-competitive inhibitors: 3-[(6,7-dimethoxyquinazolin-4-yl)amino]phenol (compound 1) and methyl 2-bromo-5-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamino)benzoate (compound 2). Two positive clusters identified on the surface of TTBK1 indicate putative binding sites for the “primed” substrate, suggesting that TTBK1 favors “primed” pre-phosphorylated substrates. The consensus phosphorylation sites of TTBK1 have not been characterized. Considering the very high homology in the kinase domain of TTBK1 and TTBK2 (Figure <2B>), they may share the same consensus phosphorylation sites (S/T-X-Yp) of the substrate. The crystallography shows that compound 1 enters the selectivity pocket, while compound 2 does not reach the selectivity pocket and shows slow binding kinetics as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis (<Xue et al., 2013>). The distinct structural-kinetic behavior could be used for the design of selective TTBK1 inhibitors. The other group also just published a crystal structure of TTBK1 (14–343), which was purified from baculovirus-infected sf9 insect cells (<Kiefer et al., 2014>). They report co-crystalization with compound 3, 3-({5-[(4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)methyl]pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-yl}amino)-5-bromophenol, a TTBK1 inhibitor with IC50 of 170 nM. Due to the structural and sequence similarity of TTBK1 and TTBK2, TTBK1/2 selectivity may be still difficult to achieve. A TTBK1 transgenic mouse model harbors the entire human TTBK1 genomic DNA, which consists of a CpG island in the 5′ non-coding region, 13 introns and 14 exons, spanning 57 kb in chromosome 6p21.1 (<Sato et al., 2008>). Transgenic human TTBK1 mRNA is expressed in cerebellum, cortex and spinal cord, and TTBK1 protein is expressed in a similar pattern in TTBK1 transgenic mice (<Sato et al., 2008>).Immunohistochemistry of TTBK1 transgenic mice exhibited very specific expression of TTBK1 protein in the perforant path region of subiculum, layer II/III of the entorhinal cortex and the external pyramidal layer of the visual cortex as compared to the age-matched non-Tg mice (<Sato et al., 2008>). TTBK1 transgenic mice showed strong phospho-neurofilament staining in the entorhinal cortex, visual cortex and subiculum, suggesting neuronal dysfunction in these regions. Enhanced microgliosis was observed in the hippocampus and visual cortex, as well as astrogliosis in the visual cortex of the TTBK1 transgenic mouse brains (<Sato et al., 2008>).The most striking phenotype of the TTBK1 transgenic mice is the loss of spatial learning at 9–10 months of age as determined by the 6-arm radial arm water maze test (<Sato et al., 2008>). TTBK1 transgenic mice showed increased levels of the Cdk5 co-activators p35 and p25; enhanced calpain-1 activity, which cleaves p35 into p25; and enhanced p35-associated Cdk5 activity. Cdk5 and calpain-1 closely regulate the post-synaptic levels of the NMDA receptor (NR) subunits, especially NR2B, and affect hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning (<Hawasli et al., 2007>; <Zhang et al., 2008>). Calpain-1 also cleaves NR2B directly and reduces its cell surface expression (<Simpkins et al., 2003>; <Wu et al., 2005>, <2007>). Consistently, we observed significantly reduced expression of NR2B in the hippocampus of TTBK1 transgenic mice as compared to age-matched non-Tg mice. We further confirmed that transient overexpression of TTBK1 downregulated NR2B expression in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons, which were sensitive to a calpain inhibitor or the silencing of endogenous Cdk5 by Cdk5-targeting siRNA transfection. We have also found that G-actin but not F-actin directly bind to Cdk5 and prevent its activation by p35 or p25 (<Xu et al., 2010a>).Collectively, we have developed the following hypothesis in the scheme (Figure <3>): inactive μ-calpain forms a stable complex with calpastatin, and TTBK1 may dissociate the complex via direct or indirect phosphorylation of calpastatin, leading to the activation of calpain (Figure <3A>). FAA (F-actin and alpha-actinin complex) forms a stable complex with p35 and G-actin is associated with Cdk5, preventing the Cdk5/p35 complex formation in the normal state (Figure <3B>). TTBK1 may phosphorylate alpha-actinin, leading to dissociation of p35 from FAA and the formation of the Cdk5/p35 complex via dissociation of Cdk5 from G-actin. The Cdk5/p35 complex serves as scaffolding molecules to generate the NR2B/Cdk5/p35/calpain complex as reported (<Hawasli et al., 2007>) and mediate the cleavage of the C-terminal region of NR2B, which is a critical region for post-synaptic membrane retention of NR2B. The loss of the C-terminal region leads to endocytosis and degradation of NR2B (Figure <3C>). This multi-step signal is composed of a new calpain activation mechanism and a new regulation of Cdk5/p35 complex formation by FAA, and is consistent with the recent report on calpain-mediated NR2B processing (<Hawasli et al."
PMC4009424_4,", 2007>)  In addition, activated calpain cleaves the N-terminal of p35 to generate p25, a more potent Cdk5 activator. p25, however, lacks the N-terminal region of p35 necessary for the association with alpha-actinin (<Dhavan et al., 2002>) and thus can form a Cdk5/p25 complex independent of FAA or G-actin association with Cdk5, leading to dysregulated activation of Cdk5. This will further enhance NR2B degradation. rhetorical FIGURE 3 Hypothetical regulation of μ-calpain activation, Cdk5/p35 complex formation, and NR2B degradation by TTBK1. (A) Inactive μ-calpain forms a stable complex with calpastatin, and TTBK1 dissociates the complex via direct or indirect phosphorylation of either μ-calpain or calpastatin, leading to the activation of μ-calpain. (B) FAA (F-actin and α-actinin complex) forms a stable complex with p35. G-actin is associated with Cdk5. These two statuses prevent the Cdk5/p35 complex formation in the normal state. TTBK1 may phosphorylate α-actinin, leading to dissociation of p35 from FAA and the formation of the Cdk5/p35 complex via dissociation of G-actin from p35. (C) The Cdk5/p35 complex serves as scaffolding molecules to generate the NR2B/Cdk5/p35/μ-calpain complex and mediates the cleavage of the C-terminal region of NR2B. The C-terminus-lacking NR2B fails to be retained in post-synaptic membrane and undergoes endocytic degradation pathway. A TTBK1 transgenic mouse model harbors the entire human TTBK1 genomic DNA, which consists of a CpG island in the 5′ non-coding region, 13 introns and 14 exons, spanning 57 kb in chromosome 6p21.1 (<Sato et al., 2008>).

This will further enhance NR2B degradation. Crossing of TTBK1 transgenic mice with JNPL3 [P301L tau mutant mice (<Lewis et al., 2000>)] results in enhanced intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated tau at multiple sites (AT8, 12E8, PHF-1, and pS422) in cortical and hippocampal regions. Testing of TTBK1/JNPL3 and JNPL3 mice at 5–11 months of age with accelerated rotarod tests demonstrated that TTBK1/JNPL3 mice showed significantly shorter retention time compared to JNPL3 mice as early as 7 months of age (<Xu et al., 2010b>). We have also detected the significant reduction in forelimb grip strength in TTBK1/JNPL3 mice as compared to JNPL3 littermates starting at 6 months of age, suggesting the sensorimotor or neuromuscular dysfunction in TTBK1/JNPL3 mice. These findings prompted us to examine the neuropathology of motor neurons in the anterior horn of spinal cords at the L4–L5 region. TTBK1/JNPL3 mice also show increased accumulation of oligomeric tau protein in the forebrain and spinal cord, and enhanced reduction in motor neurons in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord, which are associated with neuroinflammation. This suggests that TTBK1 is significantly involved in progression of tauopathy. Recent studies demonstrated that neuroinflammation may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of tauopathies (<Gebicke-Haerter, 2001>; <Ishizawa and Dickson, 2001>; <Gerhard et al., 2006>). In the LOAD brains, glial activation (both astrocytes and microglia) has a significant linear positive correlation with disease course and NFT formation (<Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011>). Enhanced pro-inflammatory activation of microglia by disruption of CX3CR1, an anti-inflammatory fractalkine receptor, accelerates tangle formation in tau mouse models (<Bhaskar et al., 2010>). In accord, immunosuppressant drug FK506 can attenuate microglial activation and delayed the tau-related neuropathology in P301S tau mice (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>). These studies suggest that pro-inflammatory activation of microglia plays a critical role in the onset and progression of tauopathy. The neuroinflammation is orchestrated by both resident microglia and infiltrated peripheral macrophages, as they can be recruited by chemokines such as CCL2, which are highly up-regulated in the LOAD brain (<Xia and Hyman, 1999>; <Grammas and Ovase, 2001>; <Lue et al., 2001>; <Sun et al., 2003>; <Pola et al., 2004>; <Janelsins et al., 2005>; <Yamamoto et al., 2005>; <Galimberti et al., 2006>; <El Khoury et al., 2007>; <Hickman et al., 2008>; <Semple et al., 2010>). However, the mechanism of how neuroinflammation accelerates tauopathy development is poorly understood.Neuroinflammation is triggered by the innate immune response, in which mononuclear phagocytes play a major role."

In contrast, M2-skewed activation is characterized by abundant levels of non-opsonic receptors (e.g., the mannose receptor) and production of high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<Mantovani et al., 2004>). However, there is no comprehensive characterization of CNS mononuclear phagocytes and their activation status (M1 or M2) in tauopathy-related neurodegenerative disorders.Our recent study demonstrated that (1) TTBK1 accelerates motor neuron loss in the spinal cord of JNPL3 mice; (2) JNPL3 mice show mostly M2-skewed microglial accumulation in the spinal cord ventral horn, whereas TTBK1/JNPL3 mice show M1-skewed infiltrating monocytes in the same region.

While these are multifaceted findings and it is difficult to draw a simple conclusion, Figure <4> depicts our proposed mechanism of how TTBK1 initiates axonal degeneration and subsequent inflammatory status and neurodegeneration: in JNPL3 mice, motor neuron loss is evident in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord, which is accompanied by accumulation of CD11c+ neuroprotective microglia, thereby limiting neurodegeneration. TTBK1/JNPL3 mice, on the other hand, show a dramatic conversion of the cell population from CD11c+ microglia to M1-skewed infiltrating CD169+ monocytes. This could be due to the accelerated neurodegeneration by TTBK1 upregulation and enhanced generation of DAMPs (M1-skewing ligands) from degenerating motor neurons, which leads to pro-inflammatory activation, generation of CCL2 chemokine and infiltration of peripheral monocytes. This may lead to the acceleration of neurodegeneration via bystander killing of neurons. Overall, these data support the idea that TTBK1 plays a significant role in facilitating inflammatory mononuclear phagocyte-mediated neurotoxicity and subsequent infiltration of peripheral monocytes into the CNS.

In JNPL3 mice, CD11c+ neuroprotective microglia accumulate in the gray matter of the ventral horn, thereby protecting from accelerated neurodegeneration.

More study will be necessary to understand the exact molecular mechanism. Large efforts have been made to develop inhibitors toward GSK3β and Cdk5 as primary tau kinases (<Brunden et al., 2010>)."
PMC4009424_6,"One of the main disadvantages of targeting the two kinases is their ubiquitous expression in multiple peripheral tissues, which warrants serious unwanted off-target side effects in multiple tissues  TTBK1 therefore is a potentially attractive candidate for pharmacological inhibition because of its apparent restricted expression to neurons in the CNS. Overexpression of TTBK1 was sufficient in inducing spatial learning impairment in mice, which is associated with enhanced Cdk5 activity and reduction in cell surface level of NR2B. Over-expression of TTBK1 transgene in JNPL3 mice resulted in accumulation of pre-tangle forms of tau. In addition, TTBK1 expression plays a unique role in accelerating motor neuron degeneration and neuroinflammation in JNPL3 mice. One would therefore expect that an enhanced expression or activation of TTBK1 would lead to increased tau phosphorylation and predispose tau to pre-tangle formation. Indeed, genetic variations in TTBK1, which are thought to result in decreased TTBK1 activity, can decrease the risk of AD (<Vazquez-Higuera et al., 2011>; <Yu et al., 2011>). Thus, TTBK1 is a novel therapeutic target of neuroinflammation-associated neurodegeneration, such as AD, FTD, and tauopathy-related ALS complex. Further studies are necessary to characterize the association of TTBK1 polymorphism, TTBK1 expression, pre-tangle formation and neuroinflammation in AD cases, and to see if reduction in TTBK1 level by TTBK1 gene targeting or silencing delays the progression of tau pathology in established tau mouse models for pre-clinical validations. The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. Tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK) belongs to casein kinase superfamily and phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein tau and tubulin. TTBK has two isoforms, TTBK1 and TTBK2, which contain highly homologous catalytic domains but their non-catalytic domains are distinctly different. TTBK1 is expressed specifically in the central nervous system and is involved in phosphorylation and aggregation of tau. TTBK2 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues and genetically linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 11. TTBK1 directly phosphorylates tau protein, especially at Ser422, and also activates cycline-dependent kinase 5 in a unique mechanism. TTBK1 protein expression is significantly elevated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains, and genetic variations of the TTBK1 gene are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease in two cohorts of Chinese and Spanish populations. TTBK1 transgenic mice harboring the entire 55-kilobase genomic sequence of human TTBK1 show progression of tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration when crossed with tau mutant mice. Our recent study shows that there is a striking switch in mononuclear phagocyte and activation phenotypes in the anterior horn of the spinal cord from alternatively activated (M2-skewed) microglia in P301L tau mutant mice to pro-inflammatory (M1-skewed) infiltrating peripheral monocytes by crossing the tau mice with TTBK1 transgenic mice. TTBK1 is responsible for mediating M1-activated microglia-induced neurotoxicity, and its overexpression induces axonal degeneration in vitro. These studies suggest that TTBK1 is an important molecule for the inflammatory axonal degeneration, which may be relevant to the pathobiology of tauopathy including AD. ."
PMC2830818_0,"Imbalanced protein load within cells is a critical aspect for most diseases of aging. In particular, the accumulation of proteins into neurotoxic aggregates is a common thread for a host of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous work demonstrated that age-related changes to the cellular chaperone repertoire contributes to abnormal buildup of the microtubule-associated protein tau that accumulates in a group of diseases termed tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we show that the Hsp90 cochaperone, FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), which possesses both an Hsp90 interacting tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain and a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain prevents tau clearance and regulates its phosphorylation status. Regulation of the latter is dependent on the PPIase activity of FKBP51. FKB51 enhances the association of tau with Hsp90, but the FKBP51/tau interaction is not dependent on Hsp90. In vitro FKBP51 stabilizes microtubules with tau in a reaction depending on the PPIase activity of FKBP51. Based on these new findings we propose that FKBP51 can utilize the Hsp90 complex to isomerize tau, altering its phosphorylation pattern and stabilizing microtubules.

FKBP51 is then sequestered to Hsp90 where it isomerizes tau to the cis conformation, allowing for dephosphorylation and recycling to the microtubule.

In long-lived neurons, this system is critically important to maintain cellular homeostasis. In the past, the mechanisms contributing to the decisions made by the cellular chaperone system, either degradation or folding of a substrate/client, were generalized into a single system with very little substrate/client specificity. However, with the discovery of well over one hundred gene products that encode for chaperone proteins in the mammalian genome, this notion has become much less pervasive. While the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 possess the ATPase function that ultimately leads to protection or destruction of a client, there are a number of accessory proteins termed cochaperones that can alter both ATPase activities of these proteins as well as client interactions (<L. H. Pearl and C. Prodromou, 2006>; <S. K. Wandinger et al., 2008>; <M. Hessling et al., 2009>; <E. Meimaridou et al., 2009>).While a number of studies have suggested that modulating Hsp90 directly may be clinically relevant for protein mis-folding disorders (<A. Sittler et al., 2001>; <P. K. Auluck et al., 2002>; <M. Waza et al., 2005>; <C. A. Dickey et al., 2007>), identifying cochaperones that specifically affect protein subclasses (i.e. transmembrane receptors or unstructured proteins) could provide more specific drug targets with fewer adverse consequences. For example, the Hsp90 cochaperone, Aha1, was shown to rescue mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) from the degradation pathway, preserving its levels in a partially active state (<X. Wang et al., 2006>), a desired outcome in cystic fibrosis. We previously found that knocking down the Hsp90 cochaperone, p23, which is known to regulate Hsp90 ATPase and chaperoning function (<K. Richter et al., 2004>), caused significant decreases in tau levels (<C. A. Dickey et al., 2007>). This led us to speculate that other Hsp90 cochaperones might also lead to preservation of abnormal proteins, which in some instances would be the desired outcome, as with CFTR, or in other instances, may be an unwanted mechanism leading to accumulation of unstructured proteins, as with hyper-phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau). In 2006, Kraemer et al. showed that knockdown of several cochaperones with siRNA could prevent or accelerate tau pathology in a C. elegans model of tauopathy. From a genome wide screen, they identified the orthologue of CHIP, an ubiquitin ligase previously linked to tau accumulation, Hsp70, a major ATPase of the chaperone network, and FKBP52, a PPIase that can interact directly with Hsp90 and Hsp70 through a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (<C. Radanyi et al., 1994>; <J. Hohfeld et al., 1995>; <G. L. Blatch and M. Lassle, 1999>; <F. Pirkl and J. Buchner, 2001>; <F. Pirkl et al., 2001>). Interestingly, mammals also carry the FKBP51 gene, which is 70% similar to FKBP52, but is not present in C. elegans (<J. M. Richardson et al., 2007>). Therefore, we endeavored to elucidate how these two proteins might impact tau stability in mammalian systems with the goal of possibly identifying a novel target for therapeutic development.

All proteins were purified via a succession of Ni-NTA-sepharose chromatography (equilibrated in 50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole (pH 7.5), elution by a step gradient to 300 mM imidazole) and gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 column in 40 mM Hepes, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5. The purity of all proteins was verified on a Coomassie-Brilliant-Blue stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All FKBP51s were judged to be >95% pure. The proteins were shock-frozen and stored at −80°C. The concentrations of purified FKBP51, FKBP51 W90A and FKBP51 F130A were determined using the extinction coeffcients of 0.732, 0.634 and 0.733 respectively, for a 1 mg/ml solution in a 1 cm cuvette at 280 nm, calculated according to Gill & von Hippel (<S. C. Gill and P. H. von Hippel, 1989>). PPIase activity towards peptide substrates was measured by protease-coupled assay (<G. Fischer et al., 1984>) using the synthetic peptide succinyl-Ala-X-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany), with X being either Leu or Ile. p-Nitroanilide can only be cleaved off by chymotrypsin when the X-Pro bond is in the trans configuration. The release of p-nitroanilide results in an increase in absorbance at 390 nm. The measurements were performed in a Cary 50 Bio UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, USA) with a thermostated cell holder at a constant temperature of 10°C. To obtain the rate constants the reaction kinetics were fitted to a monoexponential function using the program Origin 8.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, USA). The rate constants were plotted against their respective enzyme concentration and a linear regression was performed. The activity of the FKBP51s (kcat/KM) was determined by the slope of the linear regression. All activity values are means of three independent experiments. The experimental error is indicated. Cytostatic factor (CSF)-arrested Xenopus egg extracts were prepared according to a standard protocol as previously described (<A. Desai et al., 1999>) and supplemented with 20µM Rhodamine-labeled tubulin for visualization of microtubule structures. Recombinant His6-tagged WT FKBP51 or F130A mutant FKPB51 proteins were added to the extracts in the concentration of 1µM. Recombinant His6-tagged tau was added at 2.5µM. For control, equivalent volumes of buffer were added. 20µM nocodazole was used as negative control and 20µM taxol was used as a positive control. Extracts were incubated on ice for 1.0 hr to ensure an even distribution of the added proteins. Microtubule polymerization was studied according to a published protocol (<P. P. Budde et al., 2006>). In brief, to stimulate microtubule polymerization extracts were supplemented with 5% anhydrous DMSO and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Obtained microtubule asters were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Lengths of polymerized microtubules were measured by using AxioVision software (Zeiss).Microtubule pelleting from Xenopus egg extracts was performed as described in (<P. P. Budde et al., 2006>). In brief, extracts supplemented with recombinant WT or F130A His6-FKPB51 or buffer alone and incubated as mentioned above were diluted 1:20 in buffer containing 80 mM K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA and 30% glycerol. Polymerized microtubules in the diluted extracts were precipitated by centrifugation through a 40% glycerol cushion. The levels of pelleted microtubules were analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal mouse anti-Alpha-tubulin antibodies (Sigma T5168, final concentration 2 ug/ml). Recombinant tau and FKBP51 (wildtype and F130A) were diluted to a concentration of 10ng/ul in 20ul of reaction buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, 40mM CaCl2). Alpha-chymotrypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was resuspended in 1M HCl at a concentration of 1U/µl. This was then diluted to 1µU/µl in reaction buffer. 1ul of this diluted enzyme or equivalent buffer was then added to the protein mixtures indicated (<Fig 6>) and then these samples were incubated with gentle shaking at 25°C for indicated times. An equivalent volume of SDS loading buffer was then added to the tubes and samples were boiled for 5 minutes. Samples were then analyzed by standard Western blot. Horizontal brain sections from 9 mo. old C57BL6 were mounted onto slides and blocked for 60 min at 25°C with 5% normal goat serum in TBST. Mouse anti-FKBP51 and rabbit anti-tau (1:100) were incubated overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed 5× for 5 min in 1× TBS. Secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor 488 (anti-mouse; 1:1000) and 594 (anti-rabbit; 1:4000)) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with slides for 60 min. at 25°C. Slides were washed and stained with Hoecsht at 1:20000 dilution for 2 min at 25°C, then washed and coverslipped. Imaging and co-localization scatter analysis were performed with the Zeiss Imager AxioVision. We previously showed that siRNA targeting the Hsp90 cochaperone p23 caused reductions in tau levels (<C. A. Dickey et al., 2007>). With this in mind, we wanted to determine if other Hsp90 cochaperones could elicit a similar response. Based on the work of Kraemer et al., which revealed a possible role for FKBP51 and FKBP52 in tau biology, we investigated how depletion of these two proteins affect the stability of tau (<B. C. Kraemer et al., 2006>). HeLa cells stably transfected with tau were individually transfected with siRNAs targeting FKBP52, FKBP51, P23 or a non-silencing control (Ctrl). 48 hours after transfection, cells were treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG (17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin), for an additional 24 hours. Cells were harvested and tau levels were analyzed by Western blot (<Fig 1A>). Knockdown of p23 and FKBP51 caused dramatic reductions in total tau levels compared to control or FKBP52 siRNAs, regardless of treatment with 17-AAG (<Fig. 1A–B>). In fact, FKBP52 marginally increased tau levels. Hsp90 inhibitor activity was confirmed by increases in Hsp70 levels (<J. Zou et al., 1998>) and GAPDH was used to control for protein loading. Knockdown of the P23, FKBP51 and FKBP52 proteins were confirmed on separate gels (<Fig 1C>). These data are representative of experiments that have been performed at least in triplicate. As our original goal was to identify additional cochaperone siRNAs that could facilitate tau reductions in an effort to identify novel tau drug targets, we focused our studies on FKBP51 and p23. We performed a time course study in stably transfected HeLa cells over-expressing tau, and found that decreases in tau levels mirrored FKBP51 reductions, similar to what was seen with p23 siRNA (<Fig. 2A–C>). To investigate the effects of p23 and FKBP51 siRNA on endogenous tau levels, we used the IMR32 cholinergic neuroblastoma cell model. SiRNA for both FKBP51 and p23 facilitated reductions in endogenous tau levels in this neuronal derived cell line (<Fig. 2D>). Since deletion of p23 in mice results in embryonic lethality (<I. Grad et al., 2006>), whereas FKBP51 knockout mice are viable and healthy at a young age (<M. B. S. Cox, D.F., 2006>), we focused our efforts on FKBP51."
PMC2830818_3,"We wanted to investigate the profile of FKBP51 in the brain and determine whether tau and FKBP51 might interact in vivo  Using lysates from brain tissue collected at different ages from mice, we found that FKBP51 levels were not detected until 5.5 month of age and were increased further at 9 months (<Fig. 3A>). This suggested that FKBP51 levels increase with age in the brain and may only begin to affect tau at this point. Using immunofluorescent histochemistry for endogenous FKBP51 and tau proteins, we demonstrated a high level of co-localization between these proteins in brain tissue from the 9-month old mice (<Fig. 3B>). Moreover, co-localization was prevalently seen in axonal tracts (see arrows) where there is an abundance of microtubules (<Fig. 3B>; higher magnification shown in <Fig 3C>). While these data were suggestive of a tau/FKBP51 interaction, we wanted to determine whether these proteins were complexed in human brain tissue. To determine this, we co-immunoprecipitated FKBP51 from both AD and control medial temporal gyrus tissue (n=2 AD and 2 normal). We found that FKBP51 indeed could interact with tau from both AD patients and control cases (<Fig. 3D>), further suggesting a functionally relevant relationship between FKBP51 and tau. We then investigated whether FKBP51would preferentially interact with phosphorylated tau species. We increased the number of samples per group (4 for AD and 4 for normal) and again co-immunoprecipitated FKBP51. After gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting showed increased association of pS396 and pS199-S202 tau species with FKBP51 in AD tissue (<Fig S1>). These findings compelled us to further investigate the mechanism by which FKBP51 was regulating tau biology. While we had demonstrated that FKBP51 siRNA could reduce tau levels, we wanted to determine whether the reciprocal effect was achieved via FKBP51 over-expression. Indeed, we found that FKBP51 over-expression increased phospho- and total tau levels (by 80%) in HeLa cells stably expressing normal human tau, while FKBP52 over-expression had no affect (<Fig.4A>). These experiments were repeated multiple times and Student t-test of these replicates demonstrated that FKBP51 significantly increased total tau levels (p= 0.0104).We speculated that FKBP51 might be preserving tau by impairing its ubiquitination. Stable tau transfectants over-expressing FKBP51 showed reductions in tau ubiquitination following tau immunoprecipitation, while Hsp90 over-expression had no impact (<Fig. 4B>). We then investigated what effect over-expression or knockdown of FKBP51 might have on the interaction of tau with other Hsp90 cochaperones that comprise a mature Hsp90 complex. Surprisingly, we found that FKBP51 over-expression decreased the endogenous association of another Hsp90 pro-folding cochaperone, Aha1, with tau despite increasing Hsp90 binding (<Fig. 4C>). Endogenous p23 binding to tau however was not detected. Conversely, knockdown of FKBP51 with siRNA increased the association of endogenous Aha1 with tau despite decreasing the number of Hsp90 tau complexes. Moreover, endogenous p23 binding to tau was only detectable when FKBP51 was knocked down (<Fig. 4C>). We then investigated what impact tau phosphorylation would have on its interaction with FKBP51. Interestingly, over-expression of FKBP51 in stable tau transfectants enhanced the association of tau with Hsp90 suggesting a complex assembly that could be facilitated by up-regulation of FKBP51 (<Fig. 4D>). Moreover, treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid for 30 minutes enhanced the association of FKBP51. Hsp90 binding to tau was also enhanced slightly due to hyper-phosphorylation. FKBP51 over-expression also altered the distribution of tau in the presence of okadaic acid, indicating further that FKBP51 might be directly regulating tau phosphorylation. As we began to investigate this, it became increasingly likely that the cis-trans peptidyl prolyl-isomerase (PPIase) activity of FKBP51 might be playing a major role in tau biology at the chaperone interface. PPIase activity had previously been established as an enzymatic function that could regulate tau phosphorylation. This has been elegantly presented for Pin1 in a series of studies from the Lu lab (<Y. C. Liou et al., 2003>; <L. Pastorino et al., 2006>; <J. Lim et al., 2008>). However, Pin1 and FKBP51 differ in that FKBP51 possesses a TPR domain and thus can interact directly with Hsp90, whereas Pin1 does not. Moreover, a function for this PPIase activity of FKBP51 has yet to be established. To investigate whether FKBP51 PPIase activity specifically could affect tau biology, we generated PPIase-deficient mutants based on similar mutations previously described for FKBP52 (<D. L. Riggs et al., 2007>) and assayed them for PPIase activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis we replaced W90 or F130 with alanine. The proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity for both mutants and wildtype FKBP51 (<Fig 5A>). PPIase activity was measured for each protein using succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-pNA (Leu) and succinyl-Ala-Ile-Pro-Phe-pNA (Ile) as substrates. The F130A mutant was essentially determined to be enzymatically dead, with greater than 99% reduction in isomerase activity, whereas the W90A mutant maintained some activity (~25% activity for one substrate and ~40% for the other; <Fig. 5B>). With the enzymatically dead enzyme variant, we were then able to determine the direct impact of FKBP51’s PPIase activity on tau phosphorylation. We tested whether tau could be isomerized by FKBP51. We incubated purified tau with alpha-chymotrypsin, which can cleave 90% of peptides in the trans-conformation, but less than 10% when the same peptide is in the cis-conformation. This enabled us to directly test if FKBP51 was able to isomerize tau. Indeed we found that wildtype FKBP51 abrogated tau degradation by chymotrypsin, while the dead F130A mutant did not (<Fig. 6A>). We then wanted to investigate whether FKBP51 mutants could still bind to tau despite enzyme deficiency. Indeed we found that all three FKBP51 variants were capable of binding to tau in vitro (<Fig. 6B>). Moreover, this demonstrated that FKBP51 could bind to tau independently, similar to what was previously demonstrated with CHIP (<G. Grelle et al., 2006>). We then evaluated the effects of the PPIase-deficient mutants on tau. We transfected wt and mutant FKBP51 into stable tau transfectants, and then performed Western analysis with various phospho-tau antibodies. This revealed that the mutants, rather than preventing tau accumulation similar to wildtype FKBP51, led to marked increases in the phosphorylation of several critical sites on tau. In particular, tau phosphorylated at S396/S404, T231 and S212 was dramatically elevated relative to wildtype (<Fig 6 C & D>). Most intriguing was our finding that wildtype FKBP51 produced no detectable levels of pS262/S356 tau whereas the PPIase-deficient mutants did cause production of pS262/S356 tau (<Fig. 6C>). These data demonstrated unequivocally that FKBP51’s PPIase activity was critically involved in tau processing. Recently Chambraud et al., showed that FKBP52 and FKBP51 slowed microtubule polymerization using a microtubule assembly assay reconstituted with recombinant proteins in vitro (<B. Chambraud et al., 2007>); however FKBP52 had a much more potent effect. Now in light of our findings suggesting that the role of FKBP51on microtubule dynamics might be quite different based on its repertoire of interaction partners such as tau (<Fig 4>), we turned to a more physiological system to measure microtubule kinetics in the presence of FKBP51, the Xenopus oocyte extract system (<A. Desai et al., 1999>; <L. H. Wang et al., 2008>). This system endogenously contains many of the known interaction partners for FKBP51 (data not shown), allowing us to determine whether FKBP51 might have distinct effects on microtubule assembly when associated with these partners. We supplemented the oocyte extracts with rhodamine-labeled tubulin and either wildtype FKBP51, mutant FKBP51, or FKBP52 recombinant proteins."
PMC2830818_4,"As controls, we also supplemented the extracts with nocodazole or taxol  Fluorescent imaging of these extracts revealed that wildtype FKBP51 promoted microtubule polymerization relative to extracts treated with buffer only (<Fig 7A> and <S2>). Conversely, neither mutant F130A FKBP51 nor FKBP52 stimulated microtubule formation. Quantification of the radii of these microtubule clusters (n is shown in 7B) showed that microtubule length in the presence of wildtype FKBP51 was greater than microtubule length in extracts treated with buffer only, F130A FKBP51 or FKBP52 (<Fig 7B>). Nocodazole treatment disrupted endogenous microtubule formation, while taxol treatment produced densely packed microtubule bundles that were immeasurable due to their structure. A replicate experiment was then performed to biochemically assess tubulin migration through a 40% glycerol cushion in the presence of either wildtype or mutant FKBP51. Western blot for tubulin following cushioning revealed a significant increase in the amount of tubulin polymerization in the presence of wt FKBP51 relative to buffer, but not in the presence of the F130A mutant (<Fig S2>). We then evaluated the effects of FKBP51 on microtubule structure when these extracts were also supplemented with recombinant tau. In the presence of tau alone, long networks of microtubules were apparent (<Fig 7C>). Interestingly however when FKBP51 was also added, these networks became even more complex and arboreal, suggesting that FKBP51 can utilize tau to modulate microtubule dynamics. Quantification of these microtubule asters was not possible given the dramatic effects of tau and the tau/FKBP51 combination on microtubule network formation. Therefore, FKBP51, which can regulate tau phosphorylation via the chaperone complex, is also able to stabilize microtubules. This provides a new function for FKBP51 that has not previously been reported. In these studies, we were interested in following up on a previous finding showing that knockdown of the obligate Hsp90 cochaperone p23, which is essential for Hsp90 ATPase function, reduced tau levels in cells (<C. A. Dickey et al., 2007>). We speculated that if we disrupted the activity of Hsp90 by either inhibiting its ATPase activity with compounds, as previously shown (<C. A. Dickey et al., 2007>), or reducing levels of cochaperones that typically stimulate Hsp90 re-folding activity, we could force tau to be degraded.We surveyed the literature for the most well-defined pro-folding Hsp90 cochaperones that might be linked to tau, and selected FKBP52, FKBP51 and P23 as our primary candidates (<L. Stepanova et al., 1996>; <G. L. Blatch and M. Lassle, 1999>; <M. P. Mayer et al., 2002>). All three of these proteins contain TPR domains that allow them to associate with Hsp90 and Hsp70. In addition, both FKBP51 and FKBP52 also possess PPIase activity, which facilitates cis-trans isomerization around a prolyl-peptide bond (<F. Pirkl and J. Buchner, 2001>). Interestingly, despite the similarities between these two immunophilins, we found that knockdown of FKBP51 dramatically reduced tau levels while knockdown of FKBP52 did not. This notion of distinct cochaperones affecting Hsp90 function differentially was further confirmed by our results in <Fig 4D> showing that removing FKBP51 from the cell actually enhances the association of other pro-folding cochaperones, Aha1 and P23, with tau. Therefore, perhaps immunophilins, such as FKBP52 and FKBP51, contextually regulate the dynamics of the Hsp90 complex specifically based on the type of client that is bound. It suggests that there are many distinct Hsp90 complexes residing within cells that can be modulated by both the type of client that is bound and the interacting repertoire of cochaperones.Looking more specifically at the relationship of FKBP51 with tau, we found that FKBP51 was not expressed at detectable levels in the mouse brain until 5.5 months. Moreover, we found endogenous FKBP51 associated with tau from both normal and AD human brain tissues. These data suggest an interesting relationship between tau and FKBP51, a protein that has not been assigned a clear biochemical role in the mammalian brain until now. FKBP51 over-expression preserves tau in cells and protects it from ubiquitination, perhaps by twisting tau in such a way as to prevent access to ubiquitin ligases. We also show that phosphorylation of tau drives the association of FKBP51 with tau, suggesting that as tau falls from the microtubules, it is recognized by the chaperone machinery and primed for dephosphorylation (<Fig 8>). Therefore, we hypothesized that this could indicate a mechanism of energetic conservation that neurons have adopted, whereby recycling of tau is much less demanding than producing de novo tau for every plastic event in the brain.With this in mind, we investigated the role of the PPIase activity in regulating tau biology. Certainly, it was previously shown that the PPIase, Pin1, has potent activity toward tau, leading to tau dephosphorylation in cooperation with protein phosphatases. It was also shown recently that a disease-causing tau mutant was processed very differently by Pin1 relative to wildtype tau (<J. Lim et al., 2008>). Thus, the notion that FKBP51 PPIase activity could be affecting tau processing and accumulation would not be unexpected. Indeed FKBP51 PPIase deficient mutants led to pronounced increases in several important phospho-tau epitopes. These included pT231, pS262/S356 and pS212. The pT231site is an essential priming site for GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and is also linked to the isomerase activity of Pin1 (<Y. T. Lin et al., 2007>). Phosphorylation at this site alters the ability of Pin1 to process tau correctly (<J. Lim et al., 2008>). The pS262/S356 site, which can be mediated by MARK2/PAR1 and CaMKIIα, stimulates the ordered release of tau from microtubules, and is also resistant to CHIP mediated-ubiquitination. Thus, PPIase deficiency of FKBP51 increases the amount of this particular species as well as other phospho-tau species, perhaps making it resistant to degradation (<Fig 8>). The pS212 site is phosphorylated by Akt, and we recently demonstrated that Akt and MARK2/PAR1 may coordinate with each other to regulate tau phosphorylation and degradation (<C. A. Dickey et al., 2008>). In context with our results from the microtubule assays in <figure 7>, these data suggest that FKBP51 facilitates microtubule stabilization by facilitating the dephosphorylation of tau. Indeed, when considering the recent discovery that FKBP52 actually destabilizes microtubules (<B. Chambraud et al., 2007>), this complimentary data may provide a dichotic relationship for these two similar proteins at the microtubule scaffold.In summary, we propose that the Hsp90 complex may serve as a harbor for multiple proteins to interface. While a number of other Hsp90 cochaperones could use this interface to regulate tau in novel ways, we have focused our efforts on the Hsp90 cochaperone FKBP51. We show that the PPIase activity of FKBP51 critically balances tau phosphorylation state, leading to microtubule stabilization. Thus, FKBP51 spares tau from degradation by regulating its phosphorylation within the Hsp90 complex, and perhaps leads to its recycling along the axonal tracts to avoid derivation of new tau (<Fig 8>). We also suggest that inhibitors targeting FKBP51 PPIase activity would likely have adverse consequences, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation. Instead, a successful therapeutic approach might be disrupting the FKBP51/Hsp90 interface, attenuating the interaction all together and allowing pro-degradation cochaperones like CHIP to facilitate tau removal. However, as an increasing number of Hsp90 cochaperones are being shown to interact directly with tau, it poses an interesting possibility; that increasing levels of tau can facilitate an imbalance in the cell, such that tau may sequester critical cochaperones from their normal functions, leading to deleterious consequences for the cell."
PMC2830818_5,"By continuing to identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this protein and perhaps other disease-related proteins that may inadvertently possess a chaperone-binding signature, we can continue to develop our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases  Imbalanced protein load within cells is a critical aspect for most diseases of aging. In particular, the accumulation of proteins into neurotoxic aggregates is a common thread for a host of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous work demonstrated that age-related changes to the cellular chaperone repertoire contributes to abnormal buildup of the microtubule-associated protein tau that accumulates in a group of diseases termed tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we show that the Hsp90 cochaperone, FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), which possesses both an Hsp90 interacting tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain and a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain prevents tau clearance and regulates its phosphorylation status. Regulation of the latter is dependent on the PPIase activity of FKBP51. FKB51 enhances the association of tau with Hsp90, but the FKBP51/tau interaction is not dependent on Hsp90. In vitro FKBP51 stabilizes microtubules with tau in a reaction depending on the PPIase activity of FKBP51. Based on these new findings we propose that FKBP51 can utilize the Hsp90 complex to isomerize tau, altering its phosphorylation pattern and stabilizing microtubules. ."
PMC8049446_0,"The microtubule-associated protein tau has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Reducing tau levels ameliorates AD-related synaptic, network, and behavioral abnormalities in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. We used mass spectrometry to characterize the post-translational modification of endogenous tau isolated from wildtype and hAPP mice. We identified seven types of tau modifications at 63 sites in wildtype mice. Wildtype and hAPP mice had similar modifications, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal dysfunction in hAPP mice is enabled by physiological forms of tau. Our findings provide clear evidence for acetylation and ubiquitination of the same lysine residues; some sites were also targeted by lysine methylation. Our findings refute the hypothesis of extensive O-GlcNAc modification of endogenous tau. The complex post-translational modification of physiological tau suggests that tau is regulated by diverse mechanisms. We thank Mariel Finucane for help with the statistical analysis, Sharon Lee, Weikun Guo, Jing Kang, Xin Wang, Daniel Kim, and Gui-Qiu Yu for technical assistance, Stephen Ordway for editorial assistance, and Monica Dela Cruz and Amy Cheung for administrative assistance. The study was supported by NIH grants NS041787 to L.M. and GM103481 to A.L.B. Abnormal modification and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders collectively referred to as tauopathies<1>. A large body of experimental evidence suggests that cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides contributes causally to AD<2> and that tau mediates the adverse effects of Aβ on cognition<3>–<5>. However, the Aβ and tau species responsible remain a topic of intense investigation.Transgenic mice with neuronal overexpression of the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) bearing familial AD-linked mutations have pathologically elevated Aβ levels in the brain and develop a range of other AD-like abnormalities<2>. Although most lines of hAPP mice do not spontaneously develop abnormal modification or accumulation of endogenous mouse tau, genetic ablation of tau prevents or reduces behavioral impairments, synaptic deficits, neural network dysfunction, and related molecular alterations in several lines of hAPP mice without affecting their levels of soluble Aβ, amyloid plaques, or neuritic dystrophy<3>–<7>. In addition, tau reduction markedly increases resistance to seizure induction in various models of epilepsy<3>,<5>,<8>–<11>.Two principal mechanisms have been proposed by which tau may enable Aβ-induced impairments. According to one hypothesis, physiological forms of tau enable aberrant neural network activity caused by diverse pathogenic triggers<3>,<5>. An alternative hypothesis is that Aβ changes the posttranslational modification (PTM) or distribution of tau, causing an adverse gain-of-function that turns tau into an active mediator of Aβ-induced neuronal dysfunction<12>,<13>. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive<2>. Characterizing PTMs of tau may help identify strategies to block the pathological processes it enables or mediates.Most studies of tau PTMs focused on the phosphorylation of abnormal tau or were done under cell-free conditions or in cultured cell lines. These studies provided important information on abnormal tau. However, much less is known about the type and extent of physiological tau modifications that occur in vivo. Furthermore, many tau modifications have not yet been studied as widely as phosphorylation, including O-GlcNAc modification, ubiquitination, methylation, and acetylation. Methylation of tau on lysine and arginine residues has been described very recently<14>–<16>, but the functional effects are mostly unknown. O-GlcNAc modification has been proposed to prevent tau phosphorylation by occupying many serines and threonines<17>–<19>, thereby preventing dissociation of tau from microtubules and tau aggregation. However, only one O-GlcNAc site has been found on endogenous tau<20>, in contrast to 51 phosphorylation sites<14>,<21>. Ubiquitination of tau has been identified by mass spectrometry of paired helical filaments isolated from AD brains<22>,<23>. Tau acetylation has been studied primarily under cell-free conditions and in cell culture and is increased in AD brains by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry<24>–<26>. Acetylation may oppose ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated tau<26>, but may also serve alternate regulatory functions. Physiological tau probably exists as a complex mixture of differentially modified molecules, but little is known about its baseline ubiquitination or acetylation state.Further complicating the interpretation of tau modifications, the quality of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) information on which the assignments are based was often suboptimal or unreported<21>,<24>,<26>. Assignment of tau phosphorylation sites is especially difficult because of the clustering of potential phosphorylation sites and the abundance of peptides with multiple phosphoryl moieties<21>. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the calculation of confidence scores for modification site assignments, such as the SLIP score or Ascore<27>,<28>. However, tau modification sites in online databases do not yet include this information, making it difficult to assess the quality of the information provided<29>,<30>.Here we used mass spectrometry to extensively investigate physiological modifications of endogenous tau in brain tissues from untreated wildtype and hAPP mice. We focused on mouse tau because working with mice made it possible to standardize peri-mortem variables and optimize sample preservation. Moreover, the sequence of mouse tau is similar to human tau (89% identical, 92% similar, blastp vs. human tau 441), and MS allowed reliable quantitative comparison of tau modifications in wildtype and hAPP mice. Using endogenous tau samples isolated from wildtype mouse hippocampus and cortex (experiments listed in <Supplementary Table 1>), we identified and made site assignments for seven types of post-translational modifications: arginine mono-methylation, lysine acetylation, lysine mono-methylation, lysine di-methylation<31>, lysine ubiquitination, serine O-GlcNAc modification, and serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation (<Fig. 1a>, <Tables 1> and <2>, and <Supplementary Table 2>). Lysine ubiquitination was inferred from the detection of GlyGly-modified lysine, which results from trypsin cleavage of ubiquitin. Our experiments covered 96% of the tau sequence and permitted the assignment of 63 unique post-translational modifications, which are listed in <Table 2> by position within mouse tau 430 and the homologous position in human tau 441. As is the convention in tau literature, all amino acid numbering in the text refers to the homologous site in human tau 441. To our knowledge, 22 of the 63 modifications have not been previously reported, and all of these novel modifications occurred on arginine or lysine residues that are conserved in human tau (<Table 1>, bold and red font in <Table 2>, and <Fig. 1b–d>). To search for O-GlcNAcylated tau species, digests of large-scale tau preparations were subjected to lectin weak-affinity chromatography enrichment (<Supplementary Table 1>) in a strategy optimized to identify O-GlcNAc peptides (Online Methods). O-GlcNAc was identified at a single site (S400) on tau (<Fig. 1e>), along with 122 O-GlcNAcylated peptide species from co-purifying proteins (<Supplementary Table 3>). The presence of O-GlcNAc modification at only one site on tau contrasted with the prevalence of other modification types.The majority of phosphorylation sites were outside the microtubule-binding repeat domain (MBRD) (<Fig. 1e>). In some instances, multiply phosphorylated peptides did not yield MS/MS spectra of sufficient quality to identify the modified residues unambiguously."
PMC8049446_1,"To better identify modification sites in these cases, we generated tau samples with higher levels of multiply phosphorylated peptides by subjecting wildtype mice to anesthesia/hypothermia  Results in this model (<Supplementary Tables 1 and 2>) suggested that endogenous di-phosphorylation in the 210–224 region likely represents phosphorylation of T212 and T217. However, this approach did not resolve doubly and triply phosphorylated sites in the tryptic peptide representing residues 407–438. Because this peptide contained 10 candidate serine/threonine sites for phosphorylation and showed partial methionine oxidation, we could unambiguously assign only one phosphorylation site (S409).Lysine modifications tended to be enriched in the MBRD, though the enrichment was not statistically significant. Most lysines targeted by acetylation (86%) were also targeted by alternative modifications, usually ubiquitination (<Fig. 1d>). Conversely, 73% of lysines targeted by ubiquitination were also targeted by acetylation. Acetylation and ubiquitination targeted the same lysine more often than would be predicted by chance (P = 0.00002 by Pearson's chi-squared test), and methylation (both mono- and di-) targeted lysines that were targeted by both acetylation and ubiquitination (P = 0.0005 by likelihood ratio test). We next queried our extensive dataset to investigate whether tau modifications are altered by neuronal overexpression of hAPP/Aβ in vivo. We identified in hAPP mice nine tau modification species not found in wildtype mice (italicized in <Table 2>, see also <Supplementary Table 2>): five singly modified PTM sites, and four peptides with multiple phosphorylations in residues 386–416. Two of the single modifications, both methylations, are novel. However, their abundance approached the lower limit of detection, so it is uncertain whether they are specific to hAPP mice or also present at undetectable levels in wildtype mice.Our combined list of tau modifications in wildtype and hAPP mice (<Table 2> and <Supplementary Table 2>) was therefore used to develop a targeted mass spectrometry analysis for a quantitative comparison between hAPP mice and wildtype controls. Because some mass spectra could not be unambiguously assigned in all mice, modified peptides with the same parent mass that could be attributed to modification within a given sequence but without confident site assignment were quantified as a single species (<Table 3>). Thirty-two different peptide modifications were compared in two independent experiments (<Table 3> and <Supplementary Tables 4–6>), but none differed significantly and consistently between hAPP and wildtype mice (<Supplementary Fig. 1a>). Because of the potential relevance of OGlcNAc modification of tau to AD<17>,<32>–<34>, the presence of this modification was also assessed by western blot analysis with the site-specific antibody Ab3925<35>. Again, the levels of tau O-GlcNAcylated on S400 did not differ significantly in hAPP and wildtype mice (<Supplementary Fig. 2a,b>).Even small amounts of abnormal tau may be highly pathogenic when associated with the post-synaptic density (PSD)<5>,<12>,<13>,<36>. Therefore, we also compared tau modifications in PSD fractions isolated from the hippocampus and cortex of hAPP and wildtype mice (<Fig. 2a,b>). Because of the low amount of tau isolated from PSD fractions, only the most abundant modifications could be compared. Sixteen modified peptides were identified in three independent experiments (<Table 3>, <Supplementary Fig. 1b, and Supplementary Tables 6–8>). Acetylated K281 was detected in a single experiment; all other peptide modifications in the PSD were phosphorylations. In a side-by-side comparison of tau isolated from the PSD or from whole hippocampal and cortical lysates, two of the five modified peptides we quantified differentiated PSD tau from whole-lysate tau. In the 386–404 region, di-phosphorylation was higher, and tri-phosphorylation was lower, in PSD tau than in whole-lysate tau (<Fig. 2c>). None of the tau modifications in PSD fractions were significantly and consistently different in hAPP mice and wildtype controls (<Supplementary Fig. 1b>). Western blot analysis with PHF1 antibody to identify PSD tau phosphorylated at residues 396 and 404 revealed no significant difference between hAPP and wildtype mice either (<Supplementary Fig. 3a,b>). Tau phosphorylation at S416 in the PSD was detected at higher frequency in hAPP mice (35%) than in wildtype mice (16%), although the difference was not statistically significant. This site merits further investigation. In this study, we identified seven types of physiological PTMs at 63 sites on endogenous mouse tau, one third of which were novel. To our knowledge, this increases to 100 the number of site-assigned PTMs that have been identified on endogenous, wildtype tau from human, mouse, or rat (<Supplementary Table 9>). Forty-five of the 63 tau PTMs we detected were previously identified in wildtype animals without pathological phenotypes and/or in human brain tissues lacking neurodegeneration. Of the 23 PTMs we did not detect, 15 had been identified only in human brain tissue, and eight were identified in mouse or rat brain by modification-specific enrichment (<Supplementary Table 9>)<14>. Of the 16 human PTM sites, six are located in poorly conserved sequences or low-abundance splice variants of mouse tau<37>,<38>. The remaining nine target lysines (mono-methyl-K190, -K290, -K317, and -K353; di-methyl K267, -K290, -K317, and -K353; and acetyl-K274) may be PTMs whose abundance genuinely differs between mice and humans.Previous studies typically reported two or three types of modification in endogenous tau. We detected and site-assigned seven modification types in an unbiased manner—revealing a higher level of regulation of endogenous tau than previously appreciated. Although it failed to detect eight mouse or rat tau modifications identified by modification enrichment, our unbiased detection method identified 22 novel tau modifications. We also confirmed seven putative modifications for which in vitro evidence was limited, including six lysine acetylations (<Supplementary Table 9>)<21>,<24>,<26>,<29>. We further identified as physiological three lysine modifications (GlyGly-K311 and -K317 and methyl-K163) previously found only in pathological tissues<16>,<23>. Our findings effectively double the number of known distinct lysine modifications of physiological tau (<Supplementary Table 9>) and highlight the potential significance of lysine-mediated regulation.The robust targeting of acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation to the same set of lysines in endogenous tau suggests cross-talk between these modifications<39>. Findings in cultures of primary neurons and HEK293 cells suggested a competition between acetylation and ubiquitination of specific lysines in tau<26>. Our findings suggest that acetylation and ubiquitination also compete to modify lysines in tau in vivo. Nearly all acetylation sites on tau were alternately modified by ubiquitin, including three of the four KXGS motifs, which regulate neurite extension and the binding of tau to microtubules<40>,<41>. A cell culture study showed competitive regulation of acetylation and phosphorylation of KXGS motifs in tau<25>. Consistent with this finding, we did not detect any peptides simultaneously modified by both phosphorylation and acetylation. However, it is possible that any such doubly modified peptides in the MBRD would be too low in abundance to detect on tau even without competitive modification.We found that methylation targets two critical lysines in endogenous tau that are also modified by acetylation and ubiquitination. These highly regulated, triply targeted lysines reside in the first KXGS motif and in the PHF6 sequence (306VQIVYK311), two regions that regulate the microtubule-binding and aggregation of tau.<42> Lysine mono-methylation of the first KXGS motif (K259–S262) may prevent tau from binding to microtubules, similar to the effect of KXGS phosphorylation<41>."
PMC8049446_2,"Mutation of K311 in the PHF6 sequence inhibits both the microtubule binding and aggregation of tau<24>  Di-methylation of K311 may have similar effects. K281, which is adjacent to PHF6* (275VQIINK280) and targeted by acetylation and ubiquitination in wildtype mice, may also control tau aggregation<43>. We only found this residue to be mono-methylated in hAPP mice, albeit at low levels. The alternate modification of lysines by at least four different processes suggests that these residues have a particularly strategic role in the regulation of tau.It is tempting to speculate that different types of lysine modifications at triply targeted residues have different effects on tau function. At physiological pH, acetylation neutralizes, whereas methylation preserves, the positive charge on lysines. Because the high density of positively charged residues in the MBRD contributes to microtubule binding<40>, neutralization of charged lysines may explain the decreased microtubule binding of in vitro acetylated tau<24>, as in vitro methylated tau binds normally to microtubules<14>. In addition, mono- versus di-methylation of lysine is recognized by different methyl-binding domain proteins<31>. Consequently, these alternative modifications may direct the binding of tau to different proteins.Ubiquitination often leads to protein degradation but can also modulate signaling pathways by inhibiting protein–protein interactions through a steric bulk effect. Given the short half-life of endogenous proteins targeted for degradation, many of the ubiquitination sites we found may represent longer-lived modifications serving regulatory functions. We did not find lysine ubiquitination in the proline-rich region of tau, which may be associated with tau degradation<26>.The complex acetylation pattern of tau by different factors may help explain some of the divergent effects on tau aggregation. Acetylation by CREB-binding protein enhances tau aggregation<24>, whereas acetylation by p300 inhibits aggregation<25>, possibly reflecting the acetylation of different lysines. Indeed, the contributions of different lysine modifications to tau function likely vary by modification type and location and deserve to be further explored in both health and disease.Another modification that has been proposed to have a role in tau regulation is O-GlcNAc modification. Through a suite of rigorous experiments, we confirmed the presence of a single O-GlcNAc modification site at S400 at low stoichiometry. This site was previously identified by mass spectrometry of endogenous tau isolated from rat brain<20> and subsequently detected by western blotting with an antibody specific to O-GlcNAc-modification of S400 on tau<35>. O-GlcNAc modification has been proposed to have an inverse relationship with hyper-phosphorylation of tau on the basis of in vitro and in vivo experiments testing pharmacological blockade of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase, OGAse), the O-GlcNAc-removing enzyme<17>,<18>,<34>. However, chronic treatment of mice with OGAse inhibitors increased O-GlcNAc on S400 of tau without changing tau phosphorylation—the first indication that these modifications are not necessarily reciprocal<32>. Our findings do not support the notion that OGlcNAc modification blocks pathologic tau phosphorylation by competitively occupying many potential phosphorylation sites<19>. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that O-GlcNAc modification of tau may prevent tau aggregation or toxicity by an unknown mechanism without altering tau phosphorylation<32>,<33>.Arginine methylation is the most recently described modification of tau<15>. The MBRD arginine methylation site on tau (<Table 2>) was found in a broad survey of arginine methylation in mouse brain<15>. We found only arginine mono-methylation of tau, the functional impact of which is unknown. Because the two novel arginine methylation sites we identified were just N-terminal to the proline-rich region, arginine methylation might affect the binding of tau to membrane proteins, which is mediated by the N-terminal region<44>, or to SH3 domain-containing proteins, which is mediated by the proline-rich region<45>. Arginine methylation could also alter nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of tau<46>, the regulatory mechanism of which is unclear.Most of the tau phosphorylation we identified was at sites adjacent to the MBRD, consistent with previous reports<14>,<29>,<47>. The number of tau phosphorylation sites we found on endogenous mouse tau was similar to the number identified on tau from postmortem brain tissue of cognitively normal people; more than half of the site identifications overlapped with ours<14>. Of the 31 phosphorylation sites identified in that study, only six (four known, two novel) were found in all samples<14>. The four known sites (T181, S202, T231, and S404) were consistent with four of the singly modified phosphopeptides we most commonly detected in whole lysate, suggesting that the phosphorylation state of endogenous tau is similar in wildtype mouse brain and normal human brain tissue. We also found that tau is phosphorylated differently in the PSD fraction versus unfractionated lysate, suggesting a specialized regulation or function of physiological tau in the PSD.Notably, we did not detect any difference in tau modifications between hAPP-J20 mice and wildtype controls at an age when hAPP mice show synaptic, network, and behavioral abnormalities, consistent with our earlier findings<3>,<4>. We previously detected comparable levels of hippocampal tau phosphorylation in young hAPP mice by western blot analysis and demonstrated that increases in tau phosphorylation in older hAPP mice are restricted to neuritic plaques<3>. Other studies found increased tau phosphorylation in hAPP mice by western blotting<48>, including in the hippocampus of young hAPP-J20 mice<49>. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we assessed many more tau modifications than we could assess by western blot and were able to quantify about half of the modifications found. The few modifications detected only in hAPP mice were mostly in the MBRD and included two lysine methylation sites, suggesting increased lysine methylation of tau in hAPP mice. However, these modifications were too rare to be quantified, so we could not confirm that they were specific to hAPP mice. Indeed, we found no quantitative difference in tau modification in unfractionated whole lysates or PSD preparations from hAPP-J20 mice versus wildtype controls.These findings support the hypothesis that normally modified endogenous tau has a physiological function that allows Aβ and other epileptogenic factors to elicit aberrant network activity<2>–<5>. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that mislocalization of tau or modifications below our limit of quantification contribute to an adverse gain-of-function mechanism in hAPP mice. Nor can we exclude the possibility that tau modifications are altered at other ages, in other brain regions, or in other cellular compartments in this model, including the cytosolic compartment of dendritic spines.The extensive modification of tau in normal brains suggests that tau regulation is important, although the exact functions of tau in the adult brain are unclear<1>. Many, if not all, of these modifications were substoichiometric. Phosphorylation of tau was the most abundant modification we identified; however, normal tau isolated from human brain tissue has been reported to carry 2–4 phosphorylations per molecule by molar phosphate analysis<50>. Lysine and arginine modifications of physiological tau were even less abundant, and O-GlcNAc was not detectable without targeted enrichment. Because several tau modifications, particularly those in the MBRD, prevent tau from binding to microtubules<24>,<41>, we speculate that many of the modifications we found belong to a small, highly regulated pool of tau that is not bound to microtubules and is free to interact with diverse molecules in different neuronal compartments."
PMC8049446_3,"We provide these data as a resource for additional studies, which are needed to further elucidate the regulation and function of the many PTMs of tau that occur in health and disease  All mice were on the C57BL/6J background. Heterozygous transgenic mice from line J20 carry an alternatively spliced hAPP minigene bearing the Swedish and Indiana mutations<51>. Mice lacking endogenous tau served as negative controls for western blotting experiments<52>. Food (Picolab Rodent Diet 20) and water were given ad libitum, and mice were kept on a standard 12-h light/dark cycle. All mouse experiments were done during the light cycle. Mice were group housed with up to five mice per cage. Only naive mice were used for this study. Mice were assigned to groups randomly based on mouse number and genotype. For hypothermia induction<53>, mice were injected intraperitoneally with ketamine HCl (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (1 mg/kg) or with saline (negative control), and returned to their home cage for 1 h before analysis. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and brain tissues were immediately frozen on dry ice. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco. Phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 or 3, and 2 (100x, Sigma) and protease inhibitor tablets (cOmplete, EDTA-free and cOmplete-mini, EDTA-free; Roche) were used interchangeably with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Scientific); all were used at 1x according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Thiamet G (4390, Tocris) was used in a range of concentrations, as specified. Trichostatin A ([R-(E,E)]-7-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-N-hydroxy-4,6-dimethyl-7-oxo-2,4-heptadienamide, Sigma) was used at 3 μM and niacinamide (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid amide, Sigma) at 10 mM. Other reagents were ketamine HCl (Bionichepharma), medetomidine (Dexdomitor, Henry Schein), perchloric acid (Fisher), methanol (Fisher), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, Sigma), sodium chloride (5M, Cellgrow), sodium dodecyl sulfate (from 10% solution, Teknova), TritonX-100 (Sigma), and sodium deoxycholate (Sigma). All reagents for peptide digestions were from Sigma, except proteomic-grade trypsin (Promega) and AspN (Roche). Mouse hippocampus and cortex were isolated over ice and homogenized in 1% perchloric acid<54>. The suspension was incubated for 20 min on ice and spun at 20,000g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was neutralized with NaOH; 1 M Tris (pH 7.4), phosphatase inhibitors and 25 μM Thiamet G were added, and the solution was concentrated over a 10-kDa MW filter (Vivaspin 20, Vivaproducts; Ultrafree, Millipore). For large-scale lectin weak-affinity chromatography preparations, 10–14 hemibrains were combined from 8–10 mice. For the first quantitative experiment (<Supplementary Tables 4 and 5>), wildtype mice were selected randomly; the three most hyperactive hAPP mice were selected from a total of seven hAPP mice based on their behavior in the open field test, performed as described<55>. Mouse cortex and hippocampus were isolated on ice and homogenized in Thermo IP Lysis Buffer containing 25 μM Thiamet G and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For quantitative experiments, trichostatin A and niacinamide were added to the buffer (<Supplementary Tables 4 and 6>). The lysates were sonicated (Episonic Multi-functional Bioprocessor 1000, Epigentek Group) at an amplitude of 40% on ice twice for 5 min and spun for 10 min at 10,000g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse cortex and hippocampus were isolated on ice and homogenized in PBS containing 500 mM NaCl, 25 μM Thiamet G, 3 μM trichostatin A, 10 mM niacinamide, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors<35>. The lysates were centrifuged at 18,000g for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated at 95 °C for 7 min and centrifuged at 18,000g for 15 min to produce tau-enriched supernatants<35>. PSD fractionation was done as described, with modifications<56>,<57>. All solutions contained 1 μM Thiamet G and phosphatase inhibitors. Trichostatin A (3 μM) and niacinamide (10 mM) were used in all buffers for PSD fractionation in the second and third PSD experiments (<Supplementary Tables 7 and 8>). Combined hippocampus and cortex from one whole mouse brain were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 1 ml of buffer A (40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.5., 0.3 M sucrose, and protease inhibitors). The suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube, washed with 1 ml of buffer A, and spun at 850g (IEC Centra GP&R, rotor 216; Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and stored on ice; the pellet was re-suspended in 2 ml of buffer A and spun again. The resulting supernatant was combined with the first; 50 μl was retained as the cytosolic/membrane fraction. Then, 8 ml of 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer was layered on the combined supernatants and centrifuged at 17,000g (SW41 Ti rotor) at 4 °C for 25 min. The resulting supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was re-suspended in 1.2 ml of buffer A; 50 μl was set aside as the membrane fraction, and the remainder was loaded onto a sucrose density gradient consisting of 2.2 ml each of buffer A containing 1.2 M, 1.0 M, or 0.8 M sucrose. Then, 4 ml of 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer was added to the top, and the samples were spun at 85,000g (SW41 Ti rotor) at 4 °C for 2 h. The white layer at the 1.0 M/1.2 M sucrose interface was collected, re-suspended in 10–11 ml of buffer A and spun at 85,000g (SW41 Ti rotor) at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was kept at –80 °C overnight, thawed, and re-suspended in buffer B (10 mM Bicine-Tris, pH 7.5, 5% N-octylglucoside, and protease inhibitors) with a 26-gauge needle; 50 μl was set aside as the synaptosomal fraction. The remaining suspension was loaded onto a sucrose gradient consisting of 3 ml each of buffer B containing 1% N-octylglucoside and 2.2 M, 1.4 M, or 1.0 M sucrose. Samples were spun at 85,000g (SW41 Ti rotor) at 4 °C for 2 h, and the top layer was collected as the non-PSD fraction. The translucent white layer at the 1.4 M/2.2 M sucrose interface was collected, resuspended in 12 ml of 10 mM Bicine-Tris, pH 7.5, and spun at 85,000g (SW41 Ti rotor) at 4 °C for 2 h. The pellet was stored at –80 °C until immunoprecipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 35 μl of PSD buffer (20 mM HEPES, 5 mM sodium chloride, 1% TritonX-100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) and used for western blotting or tau immunoprecipitation. Samples for immunoprecipitation were diluted with 565 μl of IP lysis buffer (Pierce Crosslink IP kit) containing 25 μM Thiamet G, 3 μM trichostatin A, 10 mM niacinamide, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. In the final PSD experiment (<Supplementary Table 8>), tau was enriched before immunoprecipitation by heating the 600 μl solution at 95 °C for 10 min, incubating on ice for 5–10 min, spinning the sample at 20,817g at 4 °C for 30 min, and collecting the supernatant. Tau was immunoprecipitated from whole lysates of cortex and hippocampus or from PSD preparations with tau5 antibody free of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and azide (ab80579, Abcam), and a cross-link immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo-Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Elution buffer (30 μl) was used for the second elution step of the cross-link immunoprecipitation protocol. Columns were used up to twice without noticeable loss of immunoprecipitation efficiency. For experiments using in-gel trypsin digestion of proteins before mass spectrometry, the immunoprecipitated proteins were run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel and stained with SafeStain (Life Technologies). A broad band around 50 kDa was then cut out for mass spectrometry analysis. For experiments using in-solution trypsin digestion before mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitated samples were neutralized with 1 M Tris, pH 9.6, containing 25 μM Thiamet G and phosphatase inhibitors. For quantitative experiments, 3 μM trichostatin A and 10 mM niacinamide were added to the neutralization solution."
PMC8049446_4,"For the initial assignment of tau modifications, we used 1 mg of whole lysate of cortex and hippocampus and 30 μg of tau5  For quantitative immunoprecipitation experiments, we used 215 μg of whole lysate of cortex and hippocampus or the entire PSD fraction from one mouse (approximately 215 μg), and 10–20 μg of tau5 antibody. Western blotting was done as described<58>. Signals were quantified with an Odyssey Standard or CLx infrared fluorescence imager and ImageStudio software (both from LI-COR Biosciences). For western analysis of PSD fractions, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-PSD95 (MABN68, Millipore; 1:2000), washed in TBST, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-α-synuclein (610787, BD Transduction Laboratories; 1:2000) and rabbit anti-tau (EP2456Y, MAB10417, Millipore; 1:2000). Blots were washed in TBST and co-incubated with the secondary antibodies 680LT donkey anti-rabbit (926-68023, LI-COR Biosciences; 1:20,000) and 800CW donkey anti-mouse (926-32212, LI-COR Biosciences; 1:20,000), for 1 h at room temperature.To detect O-GlcNAc at S400 of tau, blots were blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with Ab3925 antibody<35> (1:500 in 2% BSA, a gift from Dr. David Vocadlo, Simon Fraser University) and then with 800CW goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (925-32211, LI-COR Biosciences; 1:20,000). Recombinant (nonmodified) tau protein (T-1007-1, rPeptide) included on the same blot as a negative control yielded no signal (data not shown). After signals were quantified, membranes were stripped for 15 min with NewBlot nitrocellulose stripping buffer (928-40030, LI-COR Biosciences). Blots were incubated with tau5 antibody (MAB361, Millipore; 1:2000) and then with 800CW donkey anti-mouse (926-32212, LI-COR Biosciences; 1:20,000).To detect PHF1, PSD fractions were dissolved in 2% BSA and loaded in equal volumes onto the gel. Membranes were co-incubated with anti-PHF1 (1:2,000, a gift from Dr. Peter Davies, Feinstein Institute of Medical Research) and anti-actin (A2066, Millipore; 1:2,000) and then with 680CW goat anti-rabbit (926-32221, LI-COR Biosciences; 1:5000) and 800CW goat anti-mouse (926-32210, LI-COR Biosciences; 1:20,000) secondary antibodies. Peptides in tau-enriched samples were identified by peptide sequencing with mass spectrometry. In-gel digestion was done according to the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility protocol (https://msf.ucsf.edu/ingel.html). For in-solution digestion, tau-enriched samples were incubated with urea (5 M final) and 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 10 min at 56 °C. After reduction, the samples were alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, and quenched with 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and the final volume was brought up to 250 μl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Trypsin and AspN digestions were done overnight at 37 °C with a 1:50 ratio of enzyme to total protein. Samples were acidified with 10% formic acid to pH 2–3 and desalted with C18 Omix tips, and the extracted peptides were dried in a Speedvac concentrator (Savant) before analysis.To target O-GlcNAcylated peptides, lectin weak-affinity chromatography enrichment was done before liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis with electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry (described below)<59>–<61>. For these experiments, tau-enriched protein samples (1.2–1.8 mg) were generated by large-scale perchloric-acid enrichment of pooled cortical lysates of 8–10 mice.Peptides were sequenced with an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo) mass spectrometer, each equipped with a 10,000 psi system nanoACUITY (Waters) UPLC instrument for reversed-phase chromatography with a C18 column (BEH130, 1.7 μm bead size, 100 μm x 100 mm). For liquid chromatography, the flow rate was 600 nl/min, and peptides were separated over 60 or 90 min with a linear gradient of 2% to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.Tau-enriched samples were analyzed by several MS/MS techniques. For collision-induced dissociation (CID) and ETD experiments, survey scans were recorded over a 350–1500 m/z range and MS/MS was done with CID or ETD activation on the three most intense precursor ions, with a minimum of 10,000 counts and 35% normalized collision energy. ETD isolation width was 3.0 Th (Thomson units) with 200-μs activation time; CID isolation width was 2.0 Th with 30-μs activation time. For the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) experiments, survey scans were recorded over a 350–1400 m/z range, and MS/MS was done with HCD activation on the 10 most intense precursor ions, with minimum signal of 4000 counts, isolation width 2.5 Th, 0.1-μs activation time, and 30% normalized collision energy over a mass range of 350–1500 m/z. Internal recalibration to a polydimethylcyclosiloxane ion with m/z = 445.120025 was used for both MS and MS/MS scans<62>.Mass spectrometry centroid peak lists were generated with in-house software (PAVA), and data were searched with Protein Prospector v. 5.10.1<63>. For protein identification, database searches were performed against the Mus musculus subset of the UniProtKB database (downloaded March 21, 2012) totaling 77,771 entries. This database was concatenated with a fully randomized set of 77,771 entries to estimate the false-discovery rate<64>. Data were also searched against a targeted library of tau isoform sequences (P10637, P10637-2, P10637-3, P10637-4, P10637-5, and P10637-6). Peptide sequences were matched as tryptic peptides with 0, 1, or 2 missed cleavages and carbamidomethylated cysteines as a fixed modification. Variable modifications included oxidation of methionine, N-terminal pyroglutamate from glutamine, start methionine processing, protein N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine, O-GlcNAcylated serine and threonine, acetylated lysine, mono-, di-, or trimethylation on lysine or arginine, and diglycyl-modified lysine. Mass accuracy tolerance was set to 20 ppm for parent and 30 ppm for fragment masses.For reporting of protein identifications from this database search, score thresholds were selected that resulted in a protein false-discovery rate of ~1%. The Protein Prospector parameters were minimum protein score of 22, minimum peptide score of 15, and maximum expectation values of 0.02 for protein and 0.05 for peptide matches. PTM assignments on tau were scored by “SLIP” scoring within Protein Prospector<27>; unambiguous site assignments had a score ≥6. Site assignments were manually confirmed.For label-free quantitation in a targeted method with HCD fragmentation, a list of parent masses with an exclusion window of ±10 ppm was developed (<Supplementary Table 2>). The parent mass list included experimentally observed and predicted masses for tryptic peptides containing up to three phosphorylations on serine/threonine/tyrosine, O-GlcNAcylation on serine/threonine, diglycyl-modified lysine, acetylation on lysine or arginine, and mono- or di-methylation on lysine or arginine, with up to two missed cleavages, as well as unmodified peptides that uniquely identify the known mouse isoforms of tau (SwissProt P10637, P10637-1, P10637-2, P10637-3, P10637-4, P10637-5, P10637-6). Dynamic exclusion was applied for 10 s after a single repeat count, with an exclusion list size of 25 masses. All peptides used for site assignments were manually checked with alternate site-assignment hypotheses. Data were searched as described above for information-dependent acquisition mode experiments. Quantitative analysis was done with a label-free quantitation method that integrates the base peak intensity for each identified species<65>. Identified peptides are reported in <Supplementary Tables 5–8>.Spectra and results for all identified tau peptides may be viewed with the freely available software MS Viewer, which can be accessed through the Protein Prospector suite of software at the following URL: http://prospector2.ucsf.edu/prospector/cgi-bin/msform.cgi.form=msviewer."

Raw mass spectrometry data files are available at the ProteoSAFE resource http://massive.ucsd.edu, and may be accessed with the accession number MSV000078796. The value of modified tau peptides in each experiment was normalized to the median peak area of unmodified tau peptides from that sample, excluding unmodified tau peptides with a value of zero for more than two samples. Any modified peptide with a peak width of zero was assigned a value of zero for the quantitative analysis. Modified peptides with the same mass to charge ratio (m/z) represent different possible peptide species within the same quantified peak and were averaged to obtain the value for that tau modification. Peptides that had the same tau modification but different m/z values (because of charge difference, missed trypsin cleavage, or oxidation) were quantified using the sum of the values for each peptide containing that tau modification. For each cohort, quantified values were normalized to the average value of that modification in wildtype mice, and the normalized values of each modification, excluding zero values, were compared in wildtype versus hAPP mice. To determine whether a modification appeared more frequently in one genotype, we also compared the number of zero values across genotypes for each tau modification. For quantitative mass spectrometry experiments, investigators were blinded to genotype and cellular fractionation information during data collection and analysis. Data supporting quantitative results shown in figures were embedded as linked files in figure legends. Sample sizes were comparable to those used in previous PTM studies of human subjects<24>,<66>,<67>, although we did not predetermine them by statistical methods. The normality of data was confirmed by visual inspection but not formally tested. Variance was assessed by F-test, and unequal variance between groups was determined by an F-test with P < 0.05. A two-tailed t test was used to compare two groups and a Welch's correction was applied when comparing groups with unequal variance. Contingency analysis was done in Prizm (GraphPad) to determine significant enrichment in the MBRD; a Holm correction was used for multiple comparisons. A chi-square test was used when all expected counts were more than 5 (acetylation P = 0.21, ubiquitination P = 0.17); otherwise, we used Fisher's exact test (arginine methylation P = 1.0, lysine methylation P = 1.0, phosphorylation P = 0.44). Pearson's chi-squared test and the likelihood ratio test to determine lysine targeting above chance was done in R (R-project).For each modification found in more than three mice per genotype per cohort with a value greater than zero, values in hAPP and wildtype mice were compared by a two-tailed t test in Excel. P values were adjusted using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction in R (R-project).A <supplementary methods> checklist is available. rhetorical Figure 1 PTMs identified in endogenous mouse tau. Mouse tau was isolated from brains of wildtype mice, and PTMs were assigned by mass spectrometry. Modifications are shown on the longest tau isoform expressed in the mouse central nervous system (430 amino acids). All assigned endogenous tau modifications are shown in the top panel (a). The lower panels show subsets of the same modifications, indicating those that are novel (b) or separating them by the amino acid modified: arginine (c), lysine (d), and serine/threonine/tyrosine (e). The N-terminal exons expressed in mouse tau 430 are shown in green, the proline-rich region in teal, and the four microtubule-binding repeats in orange. Only PTMs with unambiguously assigned sites from wildtype mice (<Table 2>) are indicated, and all sites are positioned to scale. Note that some amino acid residues can be alternately modified and that these modifications are mutually exclusive (e.g., ubiquitination, mono-/di-methylation, and acetylation). The N-terminal exons N1 and N2 are subject to alternative splicing. rhetorical Figure 2 Differential modification of tau in the PSD.

The microtubule-associated protein tau has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Reducing tau levels ameliorates AD-related synaptic, network, and behavioral abnormalities in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. We used mass spectrometry to characterize the post-translational modification of endogenous tau isolated from wildtype and hAPP mice. We identified seven types of tau modifications at 63 sites in wildtype mice. Wildtype and hAPP mice had similar modifications, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal dysfunction in hAPP mice is enabled by physiological forms of tau. Our findings provide clear evidence for acetylation and ubiquitination of the same lysine residues; some sites were also targeted by lysine methylation. Our findings refute the hypothesis of extensive O-GlcNAc modification of endogenous tau. The complex post-translational modification of physiological tau suggests that tau is regulated by diverse mechanisms. ."
PMC3035103_0,"Neurodegenerative tauopathies characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau include frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms regulating the turnover of pathogenic tau are unknown. We found that tau is acetylated and that tau acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Using two antibodies specific for acetylated tau, we showed that tau acetylation is elevated in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau and pathogenic forms of p-tau in vivo, likely by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibiting p300 with a small molecule promoted tau deacetylation and eliminated p-tau associated with tauopathy. Modulating tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic strategy to reduce tau-mediated neurodegeneration. rhetorical Figure 1 (A) Acetylation of h-tau (2N4R) by p300 but not pCAF under cell-free conditions, as shown by autoradiography.(B) MALDI-TOF spectrometry identified ac-lysines on h-tau by p300 in vitro.

Identification of tau mutations in frontotemporal dementia patients with parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 (FTDP-17) provides evidence that tau malfunction can trigger neurodegeneration (<Hutton et al., 1998>; <Spillantini et al., 1998>). In the brains of neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and FTDP-17, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a diagnostic hallmark of late-stage disease (<Cairns et al., 2007>; <Ludolph et al., 2009>). However, the accumulation of soluble forms of aberrantly phosphorylated tau (p-tau) may underlie tau-mediated neurodegeneration by disrupting the ability of tau to bind microtubules and promoting tau aggregation and fibrillization (<Ballatore et al., 2007>). Suppression of endogenous soluble tau or transgenic tau improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, respectively (<Roberson et al., 2007>; <Santacruz et al., 2005>). Thus, reducing tau accumulation, especially aberrant p-tau, is a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative tauopathies. However, the molecular mechanisms of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau are unclear.Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau could reflect insufficient clearance. Degradation of tau, especially p-tau, may involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Soluble tau isolated from paired helical filaments (PHF) from AD brains is polyubiquitinated (<Cripps et al., 2006>). The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein) is involved in polyubiquitination and degradation of p-tau (<Petrucelli et al., 2004>; <Shimura et al., 2004>). Deletion of CHIP significantly increased p-tau levels in the brain (<Dickey et al., 2006>). Ubiquitination of lysines can be precluded by lysine acetylation, which inhibits proteasome-mediated degradation of numerous proteins, including p53 (<Ito et al., 2002>), Runx (<Jin et al., 2004>), and Smad7 (<Gronroos et al., 2002>). It is unknown whether tau is acetylated and whether tau acetylation contributes to tau accumulation.Lysine acetylation rivals phosphorylation in regulating diverse cellular functions, including energy metabolism, signaling from the plasma membrane, and cytoskeleton dynamics (<Choudhary et al., 2009>; <Kouzarides, 2000>; <Yang and Seto, 2008>). Enzymes that add an acetyl group to the protein are called histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or lysine acetyltransferase. Of four major classes of HATs, p300/CBP (protein of 300 kDa and CREB-binding protein) and pCAF (p300-associated and CBP-associated factor) are exclusively present in metazoans (<Goodman and Smolik, 2000>). Enzymes that remove an acetyl group from the protein are called histone deacetylase (HDAC) or lysine deacetylase. There are three classes of HDACs. The activities of HDACs in classes I and II (HADC1–11) depend on zinc as a cofactor; the activities of class III HDACs (sirtuins) depend on the relative levels of NAD+ and NADH (<Haigis and Guarente, 2006>; <Michan and Sinclair, 2007>)."
PMC3035103_2,"Of the seven members of mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1–7), SIRT1 is the most studied and is strongly implicated in aging-related diseases, including AD (<Gan and Mucke, 2008>)  SIRT1 levels are reduced in AD brains, and the reduction correlates with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates (<Julien et al., 2009>). Overexpressing SIRT1 protects against neuronal loss in the inducible p25 transgenic mouse, a model of AD and tauopathy (<Kim et al., 2007>). It is unclear how SIRT1 protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration.In the current study, we investigated tau acetylation in primary neurons, tauopathy mouse models, and AD brains by generating two specific antibodies against acetylated-tau (ac-tau). Using gene-silencing and pharmacological approaches, we show that p300 acetylates and SIRT1 deacetylates tau. Our study also provided evidence that SIRT1 deficiency leads to hyperacetylation of tau and accumulation of p-tau. In contrast, promoting tau deacetylation eliminates p-tau. To demonstrate that tau is acetylated, recombinant tau was incubated with recombinant acetyltransferase p300 or pCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) with 14C-acetyl-coenzyme A. Incubation with p300, not pCAF, led to tau acetylation, while both p300 and pCAF were active in transferring acetyl groups to histones as expected (<Figure 1A>). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry identified multiple lysines that were acetylated by p300 in vitro. A total of 23 putatively acetylated lysines were detected out of 383 residues (∼86.8% coverage; <Table-S1>) throughout the tau sequence (2N4R, 441 amino acids). A few putative acetylated lysines were in the N- and C- terminal regions; 13 were in microtubule-binding domains (<Figure 1B> and <Table-S1>). Putative acetylated N-terminal lysines (e.g., lysines 163, 174, and 180) appeared to be acetylated in all MS analyses. Those in the microtubule-binding domains appeared to be acetylated in a subset of MS analyses, suggesting variable acetylation at these sites in vitro (<Table-S1>).To examine tau acetylation in vivo, we generated a polyclonal antibody (anti-ac-tau, Ab708) with a synthetic tau peptide (amino acids 160–182 for 2N4R tau isoform) containing acetylated lysines at positions 163 and 174 and 180 (<Figure S1> for MS spectra). A control antibody was generated (anti-tau, Ab707) using the same peptide with nonacetylated lysines. To test the specificity of Ab708 against ac-tau, recombinant human tau (441; 2N4R isoform) was incubated with glutathione S-transferase (GST) alone or GST-p300. Immunoblotting with Ab708 detected strong tau signals after incubation with GST-p300, but not with GST alone (<Figure 1C>). In contrast, Ab707 or Tau 5 antibody detected similar levels of total tau (t-tau) with either GST or GST-p300 (<Figure 1C>). Thus, Ab708 specifically recognizes tau acetylated by p300 under cell-free conditions. In HEK293T cells transfected with tau, overexpression of p300 markedly elevated the levels of ac-tau detected with Ab708 while the increase in the levels of t-tau was modest, suggesting that Ab708 preferentially recognizes p300-induced ac-tau in cultured cells (<Figure 1D>). Mutation of lysines 163, 174 and 180 (Tau3KR) reduced ac-tau levels relative to t-tau levels in HEK293T cells (<Figure 1E>). A smaller yet still significant reduction was also observed when two lysines were mutated in Tau2KR(K174R/K180R) (<Figure 1E>). These findings suggest that Ab708 recognizes human tau acetylated at positions 163, 174 or 180 and possibly other acetylated lysines on tau, but not nonacetylated tau.To detect ac-tau in vivo, we performed western blots with brain lysates from transgenic mice expressing human tau cDNA (1N4R) with P301S mutation (P19) (<Yoshiyama et al., 2007>) or from transgenic mice expressing the entire human wildtype MAPT (hT-PAC-N) with 0N3R and 0N4R as the two predominant tau isoforms (<McMillan et al., 2008>). Human and mouse tau differ at three positions in the region used to generate Ab708 and Ab707 (<Figure S2>). Ab708 detected specific signals in lysates from P19 and hT-PAC-N mice, but not those from nontransgenic (NTG) littermates (<Figure 1F>). These findings suggest that Ab708 recognizes various isoforms of human ac-tau, but not mouse ac-tau. The control antibody Ab707, which recognizes human t-tau, does not recognize mouse tau either. Endogenous tau in NTG mice was detected with Tau 5 antibody (<Figure 1F>).Rat tau is more similar to human tau than mouse tau in the region used to generate Ab708 (<Figure S2>). Ab708 detected endogenous ac-tau in rat primary cortical neurons (<Figure 1G>). Levels of ac-tau/t-tau gradually increased as neurons matured from 5–12 days in vitro (DIV), suggesting that tau acetylation is regulated developmentally (<Figure 1G>). However, the isoforms of rat tau detected by Ab708 remain to be defined. To determine the role of endogenous p300 or pCAF in tau acetylation, we transfected HEK293T cells expressing human tau cDNA (2N4R) with siRNAs targeting p300 or pCAF (<Figure 2A>) and assessed the effects on ac-tau or t-tau. Inhibiting p300 significantly reduced levels of ac-tau, but not t-tau (<Figure 2B, 2C>). In contrast, inhibiting pCAF had no effects (<Figure 2B, 2C>). These findings are consistent with the results of in vitro studies (<Figure 1A>). Next, we treated primary neurons with C646, a pyrazolone-containing small-molecule inhibitor of p300 with a Ki of 400 nM (<Bowers et al., 2010>). Under cell-free conditions, C646 at 10 μM inhibits p300 in a highly selective manner (86% inhibition vs. <10% for the six other acetyltransferases) (<Bowers et al., 2010>). Inhibition of p300 with C646 (20 μM) drastically reduced levels of ac-tau in primary neurons within 8 h. The levels of t-tau remained unchanged (<Figure 2D>). p300 is a transcriptional coactivator (<Goodman and Smolik, 2000>). However, C646 treatment for 8 h did not suppress tau transcripts as quantified with real-time RT-PCR (data not shown). Thus short-term (8 h) inhibition of p300 deacetylates tau without affecting t-tau levels. Extended treatment with C646 for 20 h lowered the levels of ac-tau relative to the t-tau (ac-tau/t-tau), but also those of t-tau (<Figure 2E>). To investigate the enzymes that deacetylate tau, we transfected an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged SIRT1, SIRT2, HDAC5, or HDAC6 into HEK293T cells expressing human tau. All HDACs were expressed at high levels (<Figure 3A>). Although expressed at lower levels than SIRT1 and SIRT2, HDAC6 eliminated tubulin acetylation (<Hubbert et al., 2002>), suggesting sufficient expression (<Figure 3B>). Overexpression of SIRT1 reduced levels of Ab708-positive ac-tau. SIRT2 and HDAC6 overexpression also lowered ac-tau, although to lesser extents (<Figure 3B, 3C>). Levels of t-tau were also reduced in cells overexpressing SIRT1 and HDAC6. Nevertheless, the ac-tau/t-tau ratio was significantly reduced by SIRT1 overexpression (<Figure 3D>). The modest reduction in ac-tau/t-tau induced by HDAC6 or SIRT2 overexpression was not statistically significant (<Figure 3D>).To examine the effects of endogenous HDACs on ac-tau, we inhibited expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, or HDAC6 with siRNAs (<Figure 3E>). Relative to control siRNA, target siRNAs significantly reduced levels of SIRT1, SIRT2, and HDAC6. Despite modest inhibition, HDAC6 increased ac-tubulin levels (<Figure 3F>). However, only inhibition of SIRT1 increased ac-tau levels, suggesting the involvement of endogenous SIRT1 in deacetylating tau (<Figure 3G>). Consistent with the observation that SIRT1 overexpression reduced t-tau, SIRT1 inhibition led to a trend of increase in t-tau (<Figure 3G>). Nevertheless, inhibition of SIRT1, not SIRT2 or HDAC6, significantly elevated levels of ac-tau relative to t-tau (ac-tau/t-tau) (<Figure 3H>). These results provided direct support that SIRT1 is involved in tau deacetylation. Our findings so far do not support a prominent role of SIRT2 or HDAC6, which both deacetylate tubulin (<Hubbert et al., 2002>; <North et al., 2003>), in tau deacetylation."
PMC3035103_3,"However, their involvement cannot be ruled out since only partial silencing of SIRT2 or HDAC6 was achieved with siRNA transfections To further investigate the role of SIRT1 in tau deacetylation, low-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with (SIRT1+/+) or without SIRT1 (SIRT1−/−) were transfected with human tau cDNA (<Figure S3>). Deleting SIRT1 significantly raised ac-tau levels. The increase in t-tau did not reach statistical significance, suggesting SIRT1 deacetylates tau in MEFs. In HEK293T cells, when lysines 163, 174, and 180 were mutated to arginines (Tau3KR), levels of ac-tau were significantly reduced (<Figure 3I>). SIRT1 overexpression reduced ac-tau in TauWT cells, but the reduction was much attenuated in Tau3KR cells (<Figure 3I>). These results implicate SIRT1 in deacetylating lysines 163, 174, and 180. However, SIRT1 reduced ac-tau to lower levels in Tau3KR cells than in TauWT cells, indicating that SIRT1 could deacetylate additional lysine residues besides those at positions 163, 174, and 180 (<Figure 3I>). In primary neurons, ac-tau/t-tau increased as the neurons matured (<Figure 1G>) but levels of full-length SIRT1 decreased (<Figure 4A>). Consistent with the notion that SIRT1 deactylates tau, levels of SIRT1 negatively correlated with levels of ac-tau/t-tau in primary neurons during development (<Figure 4B>). To investigate if SIRT1 negatively regulates tau acetylation in neurons, we deleted SIRT1 in neurons by infecting neurons from SIRT1 conditional knockout mice (SIRT1F/F) (<Chua et al., 2005>) with a lentiviral vector expressing cre recombinase (Lenti-cre) (<Figure 4C>). Controls were infection with an empty vector (Lenti-con). SIRT1F/F neurons were also infected with a lentiviral vector expressing human tau. Deleting SIRT1 significantly elevated levels of acetylated human tau relative to t-tau (<Figure 4C>), indicating that SIRT1 deacetylates tau in neurons.To examine the effects of SIRT1 deletion on the acetylation of mouse tau in vivo, we developed another ac-tau-specific antibody targeting the microtubule-binding region (264–287), which is 100% conserved between mouse and human (<Figure 4D>). Recombinant tau was incubated with p300 to induce acetylation. Like Ab708, antibody 9AB recognized recombinant tau acetylated by GST-p300, but not tau incubated with GST alone, suggesting that 9AB does not cross-react with non-ac-tau. In HEK293T cells, overexpression of p300 markedly elevated levels of ac-tau detected with 9AB, but only modestly those of t-tau. Thus, 9AB also preferentially recognizes p300-induced ac-tau in cultured cells (<Figure 4E>). In mouse brains, 9AB detected low levels of ac-tau, which was absent in tau−/− mice. To delete SIRT1, we crossed SIRT1+/− mice on an outbred background, which partially rescued the embryonic lethality of SIRT1-null mice on the inbred background (<Cheng et al., 2003>). Deleting SIRT1 significantly enhanced levels of ac-tau in the brain, providing direct evidence that SIRT1 deacetylates tau in vivo (<Figure 4F>). Although mainly localized in the nucleus, SIRT1 can be shuttled to the cytoplasm (<Hisahara et al., 2008>; <Tanno et al., 2007>). To determine if SIRT1 directly deacetylates tau, we performed in vitro deacetylation assays. Recombinant tau acetylated by p300 was incubated with SIRT1 immunoprecipitated from SIRT1-overexpressing HEK293T cells. Ac-tau/t-tau levels were significantly lower in the presence of immunoprecipitated SIRT1 (<Figure 5A>). To confirm that SIRT1 interacts with tau directly in vivo, we performed GST pull-down assays. Bead-bound GST-tau, not GST alone, interacted with FLAG-SIRT1 expressed in HEK293T cells or endogenous SIRT1 in nontransfected cells (<Figure 5B>). Moreover, in coimmunoprecipitation assays, after immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody, endogenous SIRT1 was detected with an anti-SIRT1 antibody, and tau was detected with a pan-tau antibody (Tau 5) in HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged tau (<Figure 5C>). As a class III lysine deacetylase, SIRT1 supports and promotes longevity in diverse organisms. Besides regulating endocrine and behavioral responses to caloric restriction (<Cohen et al., 2009>), SIRT1 has been strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in <Gan and Mucke, 2008>). In AD brains, SIRT1 levels are significantly reduced, and the reduction appears to correlate with tau accumulation and aggregation (<Julien et al., 2009>). Thus, deficient SIRT1 activity may contribute to tauopathy. In primary neurons, inhibiting SIRT1 with a specific inhibitor EX527 (<Napper et al., 2005>) markedly increased ac-tau, AT8-positive p-tau, as well as t-tau (<Figure 6A>). Levels of ac-tau or p-tau relative to t-tau were significantly increased with EX527 treatments (<Figure 6A>). Thus, the increase in ac-tau induced by SIRT1 deficiency is accompanied by accumulation of pathogenic p-tau in primary neurons. In mouse brains, deleting SIRT1, which elevated ac-tau, also increased AT8-positive p-tau (<Figure 6B>).How might elevated tau acetylation lead to higher levels of p-tau. Acetylation of lysines can preclude its ubiquitination and stabilize proteins that are normally degraded by the UPS, including p53 (<Ito et al., 2002>), Runx3 (<Jin et al., 2004>), β-catenin (<Ge et al., 2009>), and other regulatory factors (<Caron et al., 2005>). Since tau is ubiquitinated and the degradation of tau, especially p-tau, involves the proteasome-mediated pathway (<Petrucelli et al., 2004>; <Tan et al., 2008>), we hypothesized that acetylation precludes tau ubiquitination and suppresses its degradation.To test this hypothesis, we assessed the involvement of acetylated lysines in regulating protein turnover. We compared the turnover rates of human wildtype tau (hTauwt) and human tau3KR (hTau3KR). Primary cortical neurons were infected with Lenti-hTauwt and Lenti-hTau3KR and treated with CHX (<Figure 6C>). Infection of Lenti-hTau3KR resulted in much weaker Ab708-positive signal than that of Lenti-hTauwt, providing further support that Ab708 recognizes acetylation of lysines 163, 174, and 180. Mutating these three lysines to arginines significantly increased the half-life of tau, possibly by permanently blocking ubiquitination at the three sites (<Figure 6D>). These results support the notion that the acetylated lysines can be ubiquitinated.To directly test if enhancing acetylation can block ubiquitination, we transfected HEK293T cells with expression plasmids encoding tau and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin and then treated with EX527 to inhibit SIRT1 and with MG132 to block the proteasome-mediated degradation. Ubiquitinated tau was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and detected with an anti-HA antibody. EX527 prevented polyubiquitination of tau in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that tau ubiquitination is suppressed by enhanced acetylation (<Figure 6E>). EX527 also elevated ac-tau levels as expected (<Figure 6F>). In contrast, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation appears to enhance tau ubquitination. Treatment with resveratrol, which may be indirectly involved in activating SIRT1, significantly increased tau ubiquitination in cells transfected with wildtype SIRT1, but not those with H363Y mutant (<Figure S4>).We then directly examined whether enhancing acetylation of tau slows the turnover of endogenous tau. Primary neurons were treated with EX527 to enhance tau acetylation and with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit translation of new proteins. Endogenous rat tau in primary neurons had a half-life of around 5 h. Inhibiting SIRT1 with EX527 slowed tau turnover and increased the half-life of t-tau in a dose-dependent manner (<Figure 6G, 6H>). Consistent with this notion, ac-tau appears to be degraded slower than that of t-tau. In primary neurons, CHX markedly reduced t-tau levels after 5 h, whereas ac-tau levels were only slightly reduced after 8 h (<Figure S5>). Moreover, inhibition of SIRT1 with 10 μM of EX527 blocked the turnover of ac-tau, leading its accumulation (<Figure 6I, 6J>). Higher dose of EX527 (50 μM) resulted in more pronounced accumulation of ac-tau (<Figure 6I>)."
PMC3035103_4,"Treatment with EX527 also blocked the degradation of AT8-positive p-tau in a dose-dependent manner (<Figure 6K>)  Since degradation of tau was slowed by its acetylation, we hypothesized that acetylation is a critical early event that contributes to accumulation of p-tau that is normally degraded via the proteasome-mediated pathway (<Petrucelli et al., 2004>; <Tan et al., 2008>). In primary neurons, treatment with low levels of amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers, a key pathogen in AD, increased levels of ac-tau in a dose-dependent manner (<Figure 7A>). Higher levels of ac-tau were observed in primary neurons expressing human tau carrying FTD-linked mutation (hTauP301L) than those expressing similar levels of hTauwt (<Figure 7B>). These findings suggest that tau acetylation is elevated by stress, such as Aβ accumulation, or FTD-linked mutations.We next examined tau acetylation in the frontal cortex of patients with different degrees of tau pathology (<Braak and Braak, 1991>) (<Table-S2>). Patients at Braak stages 1–2 or 3–4 had significantly higher levels of ac-tau in the soluble fraction of the brain lysates than patients at Braak stage 0 (<Figure 7C>). Ab708 can recognize various human tau isoforms in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau (<Figure 1D>). However, unlike Tau 5, which detects all isoforms, Ab708 appears to detect some isoforms preferentially in AD brains (<Figure 7C>). Hyperphosphorylated tau detected with PHF-1 (<Figure 1D>) or AT8 (data not shown) was observed only in patients at stages 5–6, consistent with lack of significant NFTs in the frontal cortex of patients at earlier Braak stages (<Braak and Braak, 1991>). Thus, our findings support the notion that enhanced tau acetylation precedes hyperphosphorylation of tau and NFT formation. However, in patients at Braak stages 5–6, especially those at stage 6, with NFTs in the frontal cortex, levels of ac-tau were slightly lower than patients at mild to moderate stages. This end-stage reduction might be explained by severe loss of neurons, or sequestration of ac-tau in the NFTs, thus remaining in the insoluble fractions of the lysates. To test the hypothesis that tau acetylation contributes to p-tau accumulation, we determined if inhibiting tau acetylation eliminates p-tau and protects against tauopathy. Inhibiting p300 in primary neurons with the small molecule C646 eliminated ac-tau without affecting t-tau levels (<Figure 8A>). Strikingly, pathogenic tau phosphorylated at serine 202, detected with AT8 antibody, was also abolished within 2 h treatment with C646. Its inactive analog C37 had no effects (<Figure 8B>). These results suggest that deacetylation preferentially enhances degradation of p-tau, consistent with the observation that p-tau species are selectively degraded via the UPS pathway (<Dickey et al., 2007>; <Dickey et al., 2006>). In primary neurons expressing hTauP301L, a cellular model of tauopathy, AT8-positive p-tau was also diminished by C646 treatment (<Figure 8C>). Reducing tau improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17 (<Roberson et al., 2007>; <Santacruz et al., 2005>) and protects against excitotoxicity (<Roberson et al., 2007>). Our results implicate modulating lysine acetylation as a new therapeutic strategy to reduce levels of tau, especially pathogenic forms of p-tau, in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Using two antibodies specific for ac-tau that we developed, we found that tau is acetylated and that acetylation of tau contributes to the accumulation of p-tau. In primary neurons, tau acetylation was elevated by an FTDP-17-linked mutation and by low levels of oligomeric Aβ. Tau acetylation was enhanced in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tau pathology, before NFTs form. Moreover, we demonstrated that SIRT1 deacetylates tau and that acetyltransferase p300 mediates its acetylation. SIRT1 deficiency elevated ac-tau in vivo. Inhibition of SIRT1 blocked tau polyubiquitination and tau turnover, resulting in p-tau accumulation. In contrast, deacetylating tau by inhibiting p300 with a highly specific small-molecule inhibitor effectively eliminated p-tau.Our ac-tau-specific antibodies Ab708 or 9AB did not recognize nonacetylated recombinant tau, allowing us to specifically detect ac-tau in vivo. The mutagenesis study showed that Ab708 recognizes the acetylated lysines at positions 163, 174 and 180, and possibly other acetylated lysines. Mass spectrometry detected p300-induced tau acetylation at 23 lysines. However, p300 likely acetylates other lysines in the 13% of the tau sequence we did not analyze. Importantly, the sites acetylated in vivo probably would differ from those mapped under cell-free conditions. In addition, depending on neuronal subtypes and cellular conditions, different sets of lysines could be acetylated. Systematic mass spectrometry will be needed to map the acetylation sites of tau under different pathophysiological conditions.p300 induced tau acetylation both in vitro and in vivo. Exactly how p300 acetylates tau in vivo remains to be determined. Although p300 is mainly a nuclear protein, it can be cytosolic, acting as an E4 ubiquitin ligase for p53 (<Shi et al., 2009>). Since small amount of tau also may be present in the nucleus in some cell types (<Wang et al., 1993>), p300 might acetylate tau directly. However, p300 could also induce tau acetylation indirectly by unknown mechanisms. Inhibition of p300 with siRNA or the small molecule C646 reduced ac-tau levels significantly. C646 induced a much stronger decetylation effects than p300 siRNA, perhaps because C646 may also inhibit CBP, which shares 90% homology with p300 in the acetyltransferase domain (<Liu et al., 2008>). Due to the functional redundancy of CBP and p300, inhibition of both by C646 is likely to result in much stronger effects than inhibition of p300 only with siRNA.Our study suggests that SIRT1 interacts with tau in vivo and directly deacetylates tau under cell-free conditions. Inhibition of SIRT1 with siRNA or the small molecule EX527 increased tau acetylation, and deleting SIRT1 elevated ac-tau in mouse brains. However, whether SIRT1 directly deacetylates tau in vivo remains to be established. SIRT1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytosol, and its subcellular localization is regulated by pathophysiological stimuli. SIRT1 is localized in the cytoplasm of embryonic and adult neural precursor cells, but transiently translocated in the nucleus in response to differentiation stimuli, resulting in reduction of cytosolic SIRT1 activities during differentiation (<Hisahara et al., 2008>). We found that levels of ac-tau were increased in primary neurons during maturation and correlated negatively with SIRT1 levels. These findings support the model that increased tau acetylation during neural maturation could be mediated by a reduction in cytosolic SIRT1 activity. The subcellular localization of SIRT1 is also modulated by stress and apoptosis (<Greiss et al., 2008>; <Jin et al., 2007>), providing potential mechanisms by which SIRT1 regulates tau acetylation and tauopathy during neuronal injury.In human brains, elevated tau acetylation preceded the accumulation of NFTs, supporting the model that tau acetylation is an early event in tau-mediated neurodegeneration (<Figure 8D>). Our findings also suggest that tau acetylation is increased by stress due to Aβ accumulation or by mutations associated with tauopathy. However, the exact mechanisms underlying increased tau acetylation are undefined. Some likely mechanisms include deficiency in SIRT1 levels or SIRT1 activities in the cytosol, enhanced p300 levels or p300 activity, or alterations in tau conformation that blocks the access/binding to deacetylases or enhances the access/binding to acetyltransferases. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Inhibition of p300 diminished ac-tau in primary neurons expressing TauP301L, consistent with the notion that P301L-induced hyperacetylation requires active p300. In AD brains, SIRT1 levels are reduced, and this reduction correlates with the amount of tau aggregates (<Julien et al."
PMC3035103_5,", 2009>), consistent with a role of SIRT1 deficiency in Aβ-induced tau hyperacetylation  SIRT1 was found to reduce Aβ generation by activating transcription of a gene encoding α-secretase (<Donmez et al., 2010>). SIRT1 deficiency could also exacerbate the accumulation of Aβ, which could increase tau acetylation and tau phosphorylation even further. Other stress pathways induced during neuronal injury may also contribute to tau hyperacetylation and hyperphosphorylation.Little is known how acetylation affects the functions of tau. We focused on the role of acetylation in ubiquitin-dependent degradation and effects on p-tau. However, acetylation of tau is likely to play other important roles in the development of tau-mediated neuropathology. We identified at least 13 putatively acetylated lysines in the microtubule-binding domains, raising the possibility that acetylation of tau could affect its ability to bind to and to stabilize microtubules, leading to neuronal dysfunction. The positively charged proline-rich regions are tightly bound to negatively charged microtubule surface (<Amos, 2004>; <Kar et al., 2003>). Since acetylation neutralizes charges in the microtubule-binding domain, aberrant acetylation might interfere with the binding of tau to microtubule, leading to tau dysfunction (<Figure 8D>). These residues appear to be variably acetylated by p300 in vitro, consistent with a dynamic acetylation process that is amenable to modulation in vivo.The cross talk of tau acetylation with tau ubiquitination or phosphorylation may have implications for tau-mediated neurodegeneration (<Figure 8D>). Our findings suggest that tau acetylation directly contributes to accumulation of p-tau, a hallmark of tauopathy. Besides affecting p-tau turnover, tau acetylation may also modulate the activities of kinases involved in tau phosphorylation (<Figure 8D>). How kinase activities are modulated by tau acetylation is unknown. Regardless of the exact mechanisms, SIRT1 deficiency, high Aβ levels, or FTDP-17-linked mutations could lead to hyperacetylation of lysines on p-tau, preventing it from being ubiquitinated and degraded via the UPS pathway. In contrast, inhibition of p300 diminished ac-tau and effectively eliminated p-tau, suggesting that interfering with tau acetylation may be a new approach to reduce tauopathy. C646 was from Chembridge (San Diego, CA). C37 (inactive analog of C646) was synthesized by David Meyers (Johns Hopkins University).

About 48 h after siRNA transfection, plasmid pcDNA3.1-hTauwt was transfected into the same culture plates. Cells were harvested 24 h later for real-time RT-PCR or western blot analyses. Primary cultures were established from cortices of Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River Laboratories) or SIRT1F/F mice on postnatal day 0 or 1.

Recombinant lentivirus was produced by co-transfection of the shuttle vector (FUGW), two helper plasmids, delta8.9 packaging vector, and VSV-G envelope vector into 293T cells and purified by ultracentrifugation. Viral titers were measured by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at the Gladstone-UCSF Laboratory of Clinical Virology.

The mass spectrometer was a LCQ Deca XP Plus (Thermo Scientific), which was set in data dependent acquisition mode to perform MS/MS on the top three most intense ions with a dynamic exclusion setting of two. The DTA files were extracted from the raw data and systematically searched with Mascot. At least two peptides with a probability >95% were needed for the assignment of a protein. The reactions were modified from established procedures (<Pagans et al., 2005>). HEK293T cells were transfected with human FLAG-tagged SIRT1 plasmid or mock plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 % NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktails). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, equal amounts of supernatant proteins were immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4°C. Immuoprecipitated beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in deacetylation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM DTT) and incubated with in vitro ac-tau in deacetylation buffer at 30°C for 3 h with constant shaking. Reactions were stopped by adding 2× LDS sampling buffer (Invitrogen) and analyzed by western blot. Procedures were modified from a published study (<Oh et al., 2009>). HEK293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged human tau and HA-ubiquitin with or without Myc-SIRT1 (wildtype or H363Y mutant). After 2 h of incubation, cells were treated with EX527, resveratrol, or DMSO in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 20 h. MG-132 (20 μM) was added and incubated for 4 h. Cells were lysed in ubiquitination buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Supernatant proteins were immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4°C. Reactions were washed at least three times with ubiquitination buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot with anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Full-length cDNA encoding human tau was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression vector (Sigma) and transformed in the BL21 (DE3) strain. After induction with 100 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, bacterial cells were harvested and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). GST-tagged human tau or GST protein was purified with glutathione-agarose beads (GenScript).In GST pull-down assays, bead-bound forms of purified GST-tau were incubated with lysates from HEK293T cells that were not transfected (for interaction with endogenous SIRT1) or transfected with FLAG-tagged human SIRT1. Beads were washed at least three times with lysis buffer containing Triton X-100 or Nonidet-40 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot with anti-SIRT1 antibody (Millipore) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).In coimmunoprecipitation assays, HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-hTau-FLAG.

Beads were washed at least three times with lysis buffer containing Triton X-100 (0.5%) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot with anti-SIRT1 antibody (Millipore) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). C646 was identified as one of the putative inhibitors of p300 by a computational docking screen (<Bowers et al., 2010>). A convenient spectrophotometric assay was performed to validate it as a p300 inhibitor (<Kim et al., 2000>), followed by a series of secondary assays. In the coupled spectrophotometric assay, the acetyltransferase reaction product CoASH becomes a substrate for alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts NAD to NADH, resulting in an increase of UV absorbance at 340 nm (<Kim et al., 2000>). A radioactive p300 HAT assay was subsequently performed to directly measure the IC50 of C646. The specific inhibition of p300 versus other acetyltransferases by C646 was further examined. These acetyltransferases included serotonin N-acetyltransferase, and the HATs pCAF, GCN5, Rtt109, Sas, and MOZ. Statistical analyses were conducted with Graphpad Prism. Differences among multiple (≥3) means with one variable were evaluated by one-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer posthoc test. Differences between two means were assessed with the paired or unpaired two-tailed t test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Neurodegenerative tauopathies characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau include frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms regulating the turnover of pathogenic tau are unknown. We found that tau is acetylated and that tau acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Using two antibodies specific for acetylated tau, we showed that tau acetylation is elevated in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau and pathogenic forms of p-tau in vivo, likely by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibiting p300 with a small molecule promoted tau deacetylation and eliminated p-tau associated with tauopathy. Modulating tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic strategy to reduce tau-mediated neurodegeneration. ."
PMC5738035_0,"Progressive neurodegenerative diseases plague millions of individuals both in the United States and across the world. The current pathology of progressive neurodegenerative tauopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Pick’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy, primarily revolves around phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. However, more recent evidence suggests acetylation of tau protein at lysine 280 may be a critical step in molecular pathology of these neurodegenerative diseases prior to the tau hyperphosphorylation. Secondary injury cascades such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuroinflammation contribute to lasting damage within the brain and can be induced by a number of different risk factors. These injury cascades funnel into a common pathway of early tau acetylation, which may serve as the catalyst for progressive degeneration. The post translational modification of tau can result in production of toxic oligomers, contributing to reduced solubility as well as aggregation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark of AD pathology. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repetitive brain trauma is also associated with a hyperphosphorylation of tau. We postulated acetylation of tau at lysine 280 in CTE disease could be present prior to the hyperphosphorylation and tested this hypothesis in CTE pathologic specimens. We also tested for ac-tau 280 in early stage Alzheimer’s disease (Braak stage 1). Histopathological examination using the ac tau 280 antibody was performed in three Alzheimer’s cases and three CTE patients. Presence of ac-tau 280 was confirmed in all cases at early sites of disease manifestation. These findings suggest that tau acetylation may precede tau phosphorylation and could be the first “triggering” event leading to neuronal loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify acetylation of the tau protein in CTE. Prevention of tau acetylation could possibly serve as a novel target for stopping neurodegeneration before it fully begins. In this study, we highlight what is known about tau acetylation and neurodegeneration. Brandon Lucke-Wold received pre-doctoral support from the American Foundation of Pharmaceutical Education and American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists. Tau hyperphosphorylation and progression have long dominated the underlying dogma behind disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Multiple treatment strategies have been employed to prevent tau hyperphosphorylation or tau deposition as well as preventing amyloid deposition in AD. Unfortunately, these flawed hypotheses have failed to produce meaningful treatment options that can benefit patients. Our group and others have shown that looking earlier in the disease process may be more valuable in finding a treatment solution that can be clinically successful. Secondary injury mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and neuroinflammation play a more important role in disease onset than previously assumed [<1>–<4>]. These secondary injury mechanisms can be primed by genetic predisposition and triggered by insults such as neurotrauma, drug abuse, and cardiovascular disease [<5>–<7>]. Once activated, these cascades lead to persistent damage to neurons and surrounding glia causing distinct tau acetylation [<8>]. It is at this crucial stage that the pivot point occurs on whether the brain recovers or progresses to neurodegeneration. Tau acetylation has been shown to both disengage tau from the microtubule and also facilitate tau aggregation [<9>]. Because of this, preventing tau acetylation is critical for stopping disease onset. Salsalate and methylene blue have both been shown to reduce tau acetylation in pre-clinical models, however the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated and warrants further investigation [<10>]. It is likely that these drugs are limiting the expansion of secondary injury cascades following insult. In this review, we highlight the relationship of tau acetylation to AD and CTE and then discuss the most effective strategy for reducing tau acetylation via pharmaceutical intervention. On November 3, 1906, Alois Alzheimer presented the first definitive microscopic evidence of the tau tangle pathology that has become characteristic of degenerative AD [<11>]. By using the same stain that Max Bielschowsky used four years earlier, he also described neuritic plaques that sparked the amyloid hypothesis years later. The pathology was accompanied by detailed clinical reports of progressive dementia for several years prior to death. These findings would set the framework of defining AD. In 1984 the amyloid protein was identified as the core of the neuritic plaque and the amyloid cascade hypothesis was born. Over the past 33 years scientists have been attempting to find safe and effective treatments to remove amyloid from the brains of AD patients. Pharmaceutical companies have been testing agents to slow production of amyloid as well as administering antibodies or vaccines to remove amyloid from the brains of AD patients. Sadly, every anti-amyloid study to date has failed [<12>].Proponents of the amyloid hypothesis still hold out hope that if such agents are administered at the asymptomatic stage or at the very early mild cognitive impairment stage positive results with acceptable side effects might be achieved [<13>]. More recently there has been a shift to look at pathologic tau in the progression of AD. It is the location and amount of tau found on autopsy in AD subjects that correlates best with stage and severity of symptomatology, not the amyloid plaque [<14>]. As far back as 1963, such tangles were noted to be composed of filaments with a diameter of approximately 10 nm that have come to be known as paired helical filaments (PHF) [<15>]. In 1992, Dreschel et al. first reported on the structural importance of the micro-tubular associated protein, tau in disease pathology [<16>].It was at this point that research shifted towards understanding tau post-translational modifications. Normally tau has 83 potential sites of phosphorylation at various serine, threonine, and tyrosine sites of the 441 amino acid long tau protein. Excess p-tau is as high as 4–5× the normal level in the brain homogenates of AD brains when compared to control brains [<17>]. Because tau hyperphosphorylation was the first characterized, it garnered the most attention. In 1994, Khalid Iqbal was first to report that tau is a marker of neurofibrillatory tangles in AD patients upon autopsy [<18>]. He and others noted that an excess phosphorylation (p-tau) of the human tau protein could be pathological [<17>]. In subsequent studies of AD and related “abnormal” tau associated disorders such as corticobasilar degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Picks disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, excess of tau phosphorylation have been consistently reported [<19>]. Recently however evidence has emerged that p-tau is not pathogenic and is not responsible for the loss of neuronal function in AD [<20>]. CTE is a devastating neurodegenerative disease triggered by head injury. Like other tauopathies, it is progressive in nature and contributes to both cognitive and functional decline. Omalu et al. described the modern version of CTE in retired professional athletes (21), which have been validated by McKee et al. [<22>]. The players had extensive histories of repetitive concussions followed by a series of impulsive events, cognitive decline, and frequently suicide. This original characterization of CTE sparked huge controversy and met resistance by sports organizations and scientists alike. Over the next decade, other groups validated the findings proposed by Omalu and began describing a very distinct pathologic paradigm [<23>]. Similar to Alzheimer’s disease, the disease correlation was most in line with the tau progression but not the amyloid hypothesis."
PMC5738035_1,"Our group and others began looking towards secondary injury mechanisms that can contribute to tauopathy  Promising pre-clinical data pointed to the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration following neurotrauma [<2>,<24>]. The exact mechanism by which this occurs however was not completely elucidated. We found that ER stress is increased in cells that are undergoing apoptosis as well as those that develop tauopathy [<25>]. The key markers that were increased were markers of tau hyperphosphorylation AT100, PHF, and CP-13 [<26>]. It is apparent that tau hyperphosphorylation is an end-stage marker. How these markers got increased and what maintained the progressive tauopathy is still under investigation. Kondo and colleagues proposed that cis tau might play a role [<27>]. Kayed et al. assert that it is more likely the tau oligomers [<28>]. We however have discovered an earlier contributor to the disease process in tau acetylation. The lack of correlation between tau phosphorylation and functional decline sparked interest in understanding which tau modification actually does contribute to pathology. Tau is a very soluble hydrophilic protein [<29>]. Full-length tau remains soluble in solution up to 10M before it can aggregate. The tau repeat domain needs a concentration in solution of 4M to aggregate. High p-tau expressed in Sf9 cells (high phosphate) requires 0.2M before p-tau can aggregate. Since the concentration of p-tau in the CSF 20 attomolar, 1 picomolar in the interstitial fluid, and 1.0 micromolar in the neurons, it would seem quite impossible to expect p-tau at the levels seen in human AD brains to aggregate without a catalyst [<30>]. Thus, there must be a nucleating factor that acts as the “seed” which leads to the phosphorylation seen in the neurofibrillatory tangle. A neurofibrillary tangle is composed of a “fuzzy coat” or “soft polymer brush” [<31>]. This coat surrounds the core of tau fibers and can bind multiple cell components. Inside the tangle is a rigid fibril core. There are spokes emanating out of the core where two post translationally modified protein motifs exist known as hexapeptide PHF6* and PHF6. PHF6* has the following amino acid sequence: V Q I N N K whereas PHF6 has the following amino acid sequence: V Q I V Y K. Both hexapeptides are in the microtubular binding domain (MTBD) portion of the tau protein and are thought to be essential for the proper binding of tau onto the alpha and beta tubulin subunits of the microtubule [<32>].Recent evidence suggests that a posttranslational acetylated modification of lysine at position 280 of the hexapeptide of the PHF6 can lead to pathological aggregation of tau [<33>]. Post mortem mass spectrometry analysis of AD brains has shown such acetylation occurs most specifically at lysine position 280. However, acetylation of lysine at positions 174, 274 and 281 has also been reported in other human tauopathies [<34>]. This acetylation may be due to the overactivity of the acetyltransferase enzyme p-300, which acts specifically on PHF6. Gorsky et al showed that even pseudo-acetylation of the single K280 residue by p-300 was able to exacerbate hTau neurotoxicity in vivo, which is suggestive that acetylated tau contributes to the pathology seen in neurodegenerative diseases [<35>].After tau is acetylated, there is dislodgement of the microtubular binding domain from the tubulin due to the neutralization of charges between tau and tubulin molecules. This exposes the previously unphosphorylated serines/threonines/tyrosines to kinases leading to the robust phosphorylation so often seen in brain homogenates of AD and CTE patients [<36>]. It is likely that the hyperphosphorylation will only occur in the context of tau acetylation. A shift in favor of the tau kinases over the phosphatases most likely occurs [<37>]. In Irwin’s seminal paper, there is co-localization of acetylated K280 with multiple p-tau epitopes in post-mortem AD brains [<38>]. Their study showed that acetylated K280 occurred early in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Originally Braak and Braak indicated that phosphorylated tau in AD patients starts in the enterorhinal and transenterorhinal cortex and spreads up through the neocortex [<39>]. In 2012 Senanarong et al. reported a very early occurrence of AD-related cytoskeletal changes of p-tau in brainstem nuclei with likely spreading in a prion like manner (prionoid) up the white matter tracks to the neo/allocortex [<40>] (<Figure 1>). We highlight below that tau acetylation occurs in these exact same regions. Human paraffin embedded specimens were collected from post-mortem samples of the entorhinal cortex for CTE brains (N = 3) and from the putamen, caudate, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebral white matter of AD brains (N = 3). Control samples were selected from age and gender matched controls that succumbed to non-neurologic diseases. Brain slices were cut to 10 μm thickness with a Leica RM2265 microtome (Leica Biosystems). The slides were soaked in 99% formic acid for 10 minutes. A tau acetylation antibody for K280 was utilized. (Anaspec, rabbit polyclonal antibody). Staining of AD brain slices was conducted by Udo Rub and Kay Seidel at their laboratory of Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. The antibody was used at a concentration of 1:200. The standardized method of staining with primary and secondary antibodies was performed as has previously been published [<2>]. CTE brains were co-stained with MC1, which was kindly gifted from Dr. Peter Davies. The CTE images were analyzed with the Just another Co-localization plug-in from Image J. An overlap coefficient was generated for each overlay. R > 0.8 indicates strong correlation, R = 0.6–0.8 equals moderate correlation, R = 0.4–0.6 = weak correlation, and R < 0.4 is minimal overlay. Three Braak stage 1 brains were stained with the tau K280 acetylation antibody as well as matched controls. Significant staining was seen in the brain stem, caudate, and putamen (<Figure 2>). These regions were specifically chosen because of their importance for disease progression [<41>]. Slightly less staining was seen in the thalamus. Such early staining likely indicates the initial pathology in disease progression, which proceeds tau hyperphosphorylation. Similarly, staining was positive in the brainstem but was not seen in controls (<Figure 3>). Therefore, a strategy to slow tau acetylation seems plausible as a method to prevent disease onset and progression. Three CTE brains were stained and compared to age-matched controls. An overlay between acetylated tau K280 and MC1 was done. MC1 is an early marker of tau hyperphosphorylation seen in neurodegeneration. <Figure 4> shows an overlap coefficient of R = 0.33, which indicates minimal co-staining for tau pathology in control brains. <Figure 5> shows an overlap coefficient of R = 0.97, which indicates strong correlation for tau acetylation and hyperphosphorylation in the entorhinal cortex. The results show that tau acetylation is at least present at time of tau phosphorylation, but more likely precedes it. This is important in that tau acetylation may serve as a potential pharmacologic target. Targeting tau phosphorylation has yielded little in terms of viable treatments for patients with neurodegeneration therefore urging a new strategy. Min and Gan from the Gladstone Institute tested the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent salsalate in pseudo-acetylated mice at a dose of 2.25 grams per day. The results indicated significant improvement in cognitive function due to reduction in p-300 induced tau acetylation and reduced hippocampal atrophy [<42>]. Lagraoui et al. further tested salsalate in a traumatic brain injury mouse model. Their report revealed that when salsalate was given post traumatic brain injury (TBI) there was a significant reduction in neuroinflammation, improved functional ability, as well as an upregulation of genes that are associated with neuroprotection and neurogenesis [<43>]. The likely mechanism is salsalate reducing ER stress and thereby limiting p-300 activity."
PMC5738035_2,"Going forward it is imperative to examine what actually drives disease pathogenesis  In this paper, we have outlined how tau acetylation plays a critical role in the process of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we have shown that tau acetylation was increased both in human AD and CTE brain specimens. Future studies are warranted for how to target tau acetylation in pre-clinical models of AD and CTE in order to prevent disease progression and advance towards clinical trials. It is likely that ER stress, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are the triggers that activate the tau acetylation process. Pre-clinical work should flush out the mechanisms at play in order to advance towards clinical trials for potential treatments. An interdisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists will be necessary to tackle this important work and target the injury mechanisms as early as clinically detectable. Re-examining the tau hypothesis might be the paradigm shift needed for making headway on discovering new treatments for neurodegeneration. rhetorical Figure 1 Schematic showing tau pathology progression up the axonal tracts.

The current pathology of progressive neurodegenerative tauopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Pick’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy, primarily revolves around phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. However, more recent evidence suggests acetylation of tau protein at lysine 280 may be a critical step in molecular pathology of these neurodegenerative diseases prior to the tau hyperphosphorylation. Secondary injury cascades such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuroinflammation contribute to lasting damage within the brain and can be induced by a number of different risk factors. These injury cascades funnel into a common pathway of early tau acetylation, which may serve as the catalyst for progressive degeneration. The post translational modification of tau can result in production of toxic oligomers, contributing to reduced solubility as well as aggregation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark of AD pathology. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repetitive brain trauma is also associated with a hyperphosphorylation of tau. We postulated acetylation of tau at lysine 280 in CTE disease could be present prior to the hyperphosphorylation and tested this hypothesis in CTE pathologic specimens. We also tested for ac-tau 280 in early stage Alzheimer’s disease (Braak stage 1). Histopathological examination using the ac tau 280 antibody was performed in three Alzheimer’s cases and three CTE patients. Presence of ac-tau 280 was confirmed in all cases at early sites of disease manifestation. These findings suggest that tau acetylation may precede tau phosphorylation and could be the first “triggering” event leading to neuronal loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify acetylation of the tau protein in CTE. Prevention of tau acetylation could possibly serve as a novel target for stopping neurodegeneration before it fully begins. In this study, we highlight what is known about tau acetylation and neurodegeneration. ."
PMC4906247_0,"The regulation of many protein kinases by binding to calcium/calmodulin connects two principal mechanisms in signaling processes: protein phosphorylation and responses to dose- and time-dependent calcium signals. We used the calcium/calmodulin-dependent members of the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) family to investigate the role of a basic DAPK signature loop near the kinase active site. In DAPK2, this loop comprises a novel dimerization-regulated calcium/calmodulin-binding site, in addition to a well-established calcium/calmodulin site in the C-terminal autoregulatory domain. Unexpectedly, impairment of the basic loop interaction site completely abolishes calcium/calmodulin binding and DAPK2 activity is reduced to a residual level, indicative of coupled binding to the two sites. This contrasts with the generally accepted view that kinase calcium/calmodulin interactions are autonomous of the kinase catalytic domain. Our data establish an intricate model of multi-step kinase activation and expand our understanding of how calcium binding connects with other mechanisms involved in kinase activity regulation. rhetorical Members of the DAPK family share a specific basic-loop-mediated dimerization motif DAPK2 contains a kinase-mediated and dimerization-regulated CaM-binding site Autoregulatory segment CaM binding depends on kinase-mediated CaM binding DAPK2 activity is regulated by coupled CaM binding to two different sites Simon et al. show that human death-associated protein kinase activity is regulated by coupled binding of calcium/calmodulin to two distinct sites, a novel kinase-mediated site and an autoregulatory segment-mediated site, and thus establish a new link to the role of calcium in kinase signaling.

The human kinome comprises more than 500 protein kinases, around 15% of which are predicted to be regulated by calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) binding (<Manning et al., 2002>). This type of regulation establishes a crucial link between dose- and time-dependent calcium signaling and central biological processes such as memory potentiation and apoptosis (<Harr and Distelhorst, 2010>, <Wayman et al., 2011>). Most predicted Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinases comprise an approximately 40-residue autoregulatory domain (ARD) C-terminal to the catalytic kinase domain (CD). For several of these kinases it has been shown that the ARD binds Ca2+/CaM with high affinity (<Yamniuk and Vogel, 2004>). Numerous structural studies of kinase ARD peptide-Ca2+/CaM complexes illustrate how both CaM lobes wrap an extended helical ARD segment that is structurally autonomous of the neighboring CD (<Dagher et al., 2011>, <Kuczera and Kursula, 2012>). This conclusion was confirmed by a structure of the prototypic calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-Ca2+/CaM complex, in which the ARD-Ca2+/CaM-binding module is entirely separate from the CaMKII CD (PDB: 2WEL) (<Rellos et al., 2010>). Surprisingly, in the only other available structure of a kinase-Ca2+/CaM complex, death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), the ARD-Ca2+/CaM-binding segment was loosely associated with the DAPK1 CD (PDB: 2X0G) (<de Diego et al., 2010>). These data suggested that this structure did not represent an activated DAPK1 state and that activity regulation by Ca2+/CaM binding could be more complex than previously thought. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate Ca2+/CaM binding to DAPKs to unravel the mechanism of activity regulation by Ca2+/CaM binding.Members of the DAPK family are generally involved in both apoptotic and autophagy pathways (<Bialik and Kimchi, 2006>) and share significant overall sequence similarity with myosin light chain-related kinases and triple functional domain protein-related kinases (<Temmerman et al., 2013>). These kinases all have similar patterns of substrate specificity and mechanisms of regulation, with about half of them binding to Ca2+/CaM. DAPK1 and DAPK2 bind Ca2+/CaM through a closely related ARD, which is inhibited by phosphorylation of an identical ARD residue Ser308 in both kinases (<Shani et al., 2001>, <Shohat et al., 2001>). They also contain a basic loop (BL) in the kinase N lobe next to the kinase active site, which has been identified as a DAPK-family-specific signature motif (<Tereshko et al., 2001>). However, no direct involvement of the loop in DAPK catalysis has been detected (<Velentza et al., 2001>). Homodimerization of the DAPK1 CD has been shown in solution by mass spectrometry (<Zimmermann et al., 2010>); however, the functional relevance of this observation and the type of structural arrangement are unknown. For DAPK3, canonical kinase domain-mediated homodimeric assembly via activation loop swapping has been reported (<Pike et al., 2008>). This type of dimeric assembly is found in a broad range of serine/threonine protein kinases, which require activation by phosphorylation within the CD activation segment (<Oliver et al., 2007>).The remaining C-terminal domain organization varies between members of the DAPK family, and distinct modes of kinase activity regulation have been reported for each DAPK (<Carlessi et al., 2011>, <Chen et al., 2010>, <Jebelli et al., 2012>, <Llambi et al., 2005>). DAPK2 comprises an additional C-terminal tail segment that is predicted to be unstructured, and which has been shown to contribute to kinase activation via another dimerization mechanism that has not yet been fully characterized (<Shani et al., 2001>). Recent data indicate that this mode of activation can be suppressed by phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 scaffold proteins to the C-terminal DAPK2 tail (<Gilad et al., 2014>) (<Yuasa et al., 2015>). However, structural studies of the mouse DAPK2 have revealed a CD-mediated homodimeric arrangement that is incompatible with a DAPK2 C-terminal-mediated dimer arrangement (<Patel et al., 2011>).Here, we first investigated whether the BL has a role in DAPK activity and/or activity regulation. To address this question, we analyzed and compared new structures of the three most closely related human members of this family: hDAPK1, hDAPK2, and hDAPK3. We found an identical type of dimer arrangement in all three kinases that involves the BL of the CD. By making use of engineered dimer interface mutations in hDAPK2, we found that the BL not only contributes to CD-mediated dimerization but also provides a previously unobserved Ca2+/CaM interaction site. When this site is mutated, Ca2+/CaM binding and hDAPK2 activity are completely abolished, demonstrating that the established mechanism of activity regulation involving the ARD is not autonomous. The mechanism of dual Ca2+/CaM binding unraveled here has features reminiscent of Ca2+/CaM trapping in CaMKII, where catalytic activity is regulated via differential Ca2+/CaM binding coupled with oligomerization and autophosphorylation. Such conservation of key features in these distantly related kinases indicates that differential Ca2+/CaM binding could play an important role in many more Ca2+/CaM-regulated kinases and could form a link between kinase activation and Ca2+ signaling."
PMC4906247_1,"To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in human DAPK regulation, we expressed and purified truncated versions of hDAPK1, hDAPK2, and hDAPK3  Both the hDAPK1 and hDAPK2 constructs encompass the CD and ARD segments. Since hDAPK3 has no ARD, the hDAPK3 construct we used was limited to the CD. All three kinases were crystallized and the resulting structures were refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å (hDAPK1), 1.47 Å (hDAPK2), and 3.1 Å (hDAPK3) (<Figure 1> and <Table 1>). The structures presented here all crystallized in the same dimeric arrangement. In this contribution we thought it would be worth investigating this type of dimerization interface further in terms of potentially common functional implications, as such an interface had not yet been previously discovered as a general pattern in different members of the DAPK family.The hDAPK2 crystal contained two of these dimers per asymmetric unit, referred to as chains A/B and C/D, which provided an additional assessment of experimental error (<Figure 1> and <Table S1>, details described in the legend). The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of superimposed dimers from the different hDAPKs are in the range of 1.2–2.0 Å, demonstrating that the type of dimerization observed in the structures of hDAPK1, hDAPK2, and hDAPK3 is conserved. The dimeric interface areas are in the range of 930–1,600 Å2 in size (<Figure 1> and <Table S2>). This area is smaller in the DAPK1 dimer than in the DAPK2 and DAPK3 dimers, as we were unable to model most of the BL region in this kinase due to weak electron density.In all three DAPK structures, these interfaces comprise two main surface areas. The first one is formed from residues of the substrate-binding region and helix αG from the C lobe of the CD, and the interactions constituting it are mainly hydrophobic, termed the hydrophobic patch (HP) (<Figures 2> and <3>). This area is highly similar in terms of sequence and rigid structural conformation in all the DAPK structures described here. The second main dimer interface is formed from positively charged residues on the DAPK signature BL segment, which belongs to the most mobile areas in the DAPK structures. In DAPK2, the main residues that contribute to the polar interactions are Arg47, Arg50, and Arg53 as well as the active-site residue Glu100 and Asp220 from the loop preceding helix αG (<Figure 2>). In the DAPK3 structure, in which the BL residue 50 is a serine instead of an arginine (<Figure 3>), the most specific interactions are formed by Arg53 and residues C-terminal to the BL from helix αC: Ser57 and Glu60. In DAPK3 there is an additional specific interaction with Glu182, which is the central residue of the PEF/Y motif and a key contributor to DAPK substrate recognition (<Figure S1>) (<Temmerman et al., 2014>). By contrast, in the DAPK2 structure, Glu182 is blocked by an interaction with Arg303 from the ARD, which acts as a pseudosubstrate.In terms of functional implications, CD dimerization in hDAPK1, hDAPK2, and hDAPK3 is likely to inhibit catalytic activity by directly occluding the kinase active site. Furthermore, we observed that this CD dimer interface largely overlaps with that used for interactions with Ca2+/CaM, as also seen in the earlier structure of the hDAPK1-Ca2+/CaM complex (<de Diego et al., 2010>). A more detailed analysis revealed five overlapping surface patches that we termed I to V. Two of them, II and IV, coincide with the two main CD dimerization interfaces: the BL-mediated interface (II) and the HP interface (IV). These two patches contribute to more than half of the overall dimer interface area (<Figure 3> and <Table S2>). There are two other segments, I and III, that play prominent roles in Ca2+/CaM binding, but they show only minor contributions in DAPK CD dimer interface formation. Finally, there is the N-terminal part of the ARD that participates in both CD dimer formation and the well-established ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding, defined as interface segment V. Based on these observations, we investigated whether DAPK dimerization might contribute to the regulation of Ca2+/CaM binding. We addressed this question using hDAPK2, as its high-resolution structure provides the most accurate data on dimer interface interactions. To explore the relevance of the dimeric arrangement, we designed a number of mutants to reduce or abolish dimerization. To ascertain whether hDAPK2 dimerization affects Ca2+/CaM binding, we chose residues from segments that contribute to interactions with Ca2+/CaM as well as homodimerization (<de Diego et al., 2010>) (<Figure 3>). We first targeted the basic loop (<Figures 2> and <3>) by mutating Arg47, Arg50, Arg53, and Arg54 to glutamate, and we refer to this as the “BL mutant.” We selected this quadruple mutant, as all four BL residues are involved in specific dimer interactions in the hDAPK2 structure. Secondly we selected Asp220, which plays a consistent key role in interacting with residues from the BL (<Figure 2>) but is not involved in interactions with Ca2+/CaM. This residue was changed to a lysine (D220K) (<Figure 3>). Thirdly we selected Leu226, which also crucially contributes to homodimer interactions with residues from the C-terminal lobe (<Figure 2>). In contrast to the other residues selected for mutagenesis, Leu226 is oriented toward the predicted kinase substrate-binding site (<Figure S2>). We mutated it to arginine (L226R), thus matching a defective DAPK2 variant that was previously found in a glioma cancer cell line (<Barretina et al., 2012>). As a detailed characterization of purified full-length hDAPK2 (hDAPK2 FL) was not possible due to known degradation problems in the C-terminal region (<Patel et al., 2011>), we used hDAPK2 CD + ARD variants without this tail for further experiments, identical to that used for crystallization. We first investigated these hDAPK2 mutants by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<Figure 4>A). Based on the resulting recursive line fitting of calibration standards (<Figure S3>), we calculated the retention volumes for monomeric and dimeric hDAPK2. Our experimental data on wild-type (WT) hDAPK2 revealed a peak maximum close to the calculated volume of the hDAPK2 dimer. As expected, all hDAPK2 mutants analyzed showed a significant peak shift toward larger retention volumes, indicating loss of dimerization. The strongest effect was seen with the hDAPK2 BL mutant, which yielded close to the expected retention volume of hDAPK2 monomers. The effects we found for the hDAPK2 D220K and L226R mutants are similar to those observed for the hDAPK2 BL mutant. Although the shifts in elution volume were significant, the resolution of the SEC approach was insufficient to resolve separate peaks arising from a mixture of different association states.To further quantify the oligomeric composition of selected hDAPK2 variants, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements (<Figure 4>B; for experimental details, see <Table 2>). For WT hDAPK2, no reasonable fits to either hDAPK2 dimers or monomers were provided by computed scattering curves from different atomic models (for details on software used, see <Supplemental Experimental Procedures>). The observed discrepancy values in <Table S3> indicate that neither of the two association states provides a matching model. However, a significant improvement in fit was achieved when an equilibrium mixture was used to describe the data. The fitting procedure identified a mixture of 51% hDAPK2 monomer and 49% hDAPK2 dimer as the best solution (<Table S3>; for details on software used see <Supplemental Experimental Procedures>). By contrast, the hDAPK2 BL mutant was found to be predominantly monomeric (89%). The D220K mutant shows intermediate properties and is well described as an equilibrium mixture of 68% monomers and 32% dimers. In summary, our SEC and SAXS data show that a substantial fraction of hDAPK2 is dimeric in solution under these experimental conditions, and modifications in the conserved interface disrupt dimerization."
PMC4906247_2,"To validate our structural and solution data on hDAPK2 dimerization in a cellular environment, we tested our hDAPK2 constructs using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in HEK293T cells  This assay also allowed us to investigate any effects of endogenous Ca2+/CaM binding on hDAPK2 dimerization. To address a possible role of the hDAPK2 C-terminal tail in additional hDAPK2 dimerization (<Shani et al., 2001>), we first compared the BiFC readout of hDAPK2 FL and C-terminally truncated hDAPK2 CD + ARD (<Figure 4>C; for analysis of expression levels see <Figure S4>). The level of dimerization in hDAPK2 CD + ARD was about half that of hDAPK2 FL, which is in agreement with previous data (<Shani et al., 2001>). To remove any potential effects from the C-terminal tail that is found in hDAPK2 only, we performed all remaining BiFC experiments with truncated hDAPK2 CD + ARD variants.Next, we tested the possible effects of Ca2+/CaM on hDAPK2 dimerization (<Figure 4>C). As a control, we first used the previously established hDAPK2 ARD mutants S308A and W305D, which have been shown to either promote or substantially reduce Ca2+/CaM binding, respectively (<de Diego et al., 2010>, <Shani et al., 2001>). Whereas the hDAPK2 S308A variant did not change the BiFC readout significantly, the hDAPK2 W305D mutant increased the BiFC signal more than 5-fold. These data indicate that endogenous Ca2+/CaM suppresses hDAPK2 dimerization provided that Ca2+/CaM binding is not impaired. The BiFC signal exhibited a markedly reduced level of dimerization for the hDAPK2 D220K and L226R variants, in agreement with the solution data (<Figures 4>A and 4B). However, the hDAPK2 BL mutant shows an almost 3-fold increase in hDAPK2 dimerization, in contrast to the findings on the same hDAPK2 mutant in solution. In line with our data from the hDAPK2 W305D mutant, showing an increase of DAPK2 dimerization due to impaired Ca2+/CaM binding, we hence speculated that there might be a measureable defect in Ca2+/CaM binding by the hDAPK2 BL mutant. This is supported by our earlier structural data on the Ca2+/CaM complex of the related hDAPK1, in which residues from the BL are indeed involved in specific interactions with Ca2+/CaM (<Figure 3>) (<de Diego et al., 2010>). To test the possible effects of homodimerization on hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM binding, we designed a series of pull-down assays using two different approaches. First, we assessed the level of hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM binding in solution to purified WT hDAPK2 and the hDAPK2 S308A mutant that can no longer be phosphorylated at position 308. In line with previous data on hDAPK1 (<Temmerman et al., 2014>), the amount of Ca2+/CaM binding by hDAPK2 S308A was around 4-fold higher than that in WT. In the hDAPK2 W305D mutant, Ca2+/CaM binding was not detectable under the experimental conditions by direct protein staining (<Figure 5>A). We then tested the hDAPK2 BL and D220K dimer interface mutants. In the hDAPK2 BL mutant, Ca2+/CaM binding was reduced to 46% of the WT protein, whereas we found a 57% increase of Ca2+/CaM binding in the hDAPK2 D220K variant.In subsequent HEK293T cell experiments, we used western blot staining instead of direct protein staining to allow detection of DAPK2 mutants from cell lysate. Under these experimental conditions, the pull-down amounts of WT hDAPK2 and hDAPK2 S308A were too abundant for reliable quantitative analysis due to the much higher sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, we used the hDAPK2 W305D mutant that is compromised in Ca2+/CaM binding as a reference and introduced our mutations of interest into this construct (<Figure 5>B). The hDAPK2 W305D mutant itself produced residual but reliable pull-down data in HEK293T cells. We found a substantial loss of Ca2+/CaM-binding ability in the hDAPK2 W305D BL mutant and an almost 2-fold increase of Ca2+/CaM binding in the hDAPK2 W305D D220K mutant. Thus, although different references were used for the pull-downs in solution (WT DAPK2) and in HEK293T cells (DAPK2 W305D), both datasets agree in terms of loss of Ca2+/CaM binding for the BL mutant and an increase in Ca2+/CaM binding for the D220K mutant. Taken together, our findings indicate that although both mutants affect the mode of homodimerization as revealed by our structural and solution data (<Figure 4>), only the BL mutant is impaired in Ca2+/CaM binding. This explains the contrasting behavior of the two mutants in the BiFC assay in the presence of endogenous Ca2+/CaM. To further consolidate our findings on matching trends for hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM binding in solution and in cell lines, we measured the Ca2+/CaM affinity of different hDAPK2 CD + ARD variants quantitatively in solution by fluorescence anisotropy (FA) with CrAsH-tagged calmodulin (<Figures 5>C and 5D). We first used the hDAPK2 S308A mutant, in which Ser308 phosphorylation is impaired and thus all sample is expected to bind Ca2+/CaM. We estimated its affinity to Ca2+/CaM to be <3.5 nM. When this mutant was combined with the hDAPK2 D220K and L226R interface mutants, the binding affinity to Ca2+/CaM was still <3.5 nM, demonstrating that neither of these hDAPK2 variants negatively affects Ca2+/CaM binding. By contrast, when combined with the BL mutations, the hDAPK2 S308A, BL mutant showed only a residual change in anisotropy that did not allow its binding affinity to Ca2+/CaM to be quantified.We next tested the hDAPK2 W305D mutant that is impaired in ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding (<Figure 5>D), which we used as a reference in the cellular Ca2+/CaM pull-down assays described above (<Figure 5>B). This variant has an estimated Ca2+/CaM-binding affinity of 12.5 ± 0.6 μM, which is at least 3,500-fold weaker than that measured for hDAPK2 S308A. This hDAPK2 variant combined with the dimer interface mutants D220K or L226R binds Ca2+/CaM with slightly stronger affinity values of KD = 9.7 ± 1.9 μM (D220K) and KD = 2.7 ± 0.1 μM (L226R). The modest improvement in binding affinity is probably due to the increase of monomeric hDAPK2, as observed in our solution and BiFC data (<Figure 4>). By contrast, no affinity value could be determined for the hDAPK2 W305D, BL variant, which confirms the direct involvement of the BL in CD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding. In agreement with our pull-down data, the FA data also show that impairment of ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM interactions as illustrated by the hDAPK2 W305D mutant substantially reduces the Ca2+/CaM-binding affinity by at least three orders of magnitude but does not abolish it. As all known kinase structures in the presence of Ca2+/CaM possess an 1:1 stoichiometry of kinase-Ca2+/CaM interactions (<de Diego et al., 2010>, <Rellos et al., 2010>), these data indicate a coupled CD-mediated and ARD-mediated interaction to the same Ca2+/CaM module. Finally, we investigated how the observed coupling of hDAPK2 dimerization and Ca2+/CaM-binding ability affects hDAPK2 activity using a well-established blebbing assay in HEK293T cells (<Bovellan et al., 2010>). In this assay, the hDAPK2-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 causes a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton protruding membrane to form blebs. The number of cells undergoing membrane blebbing can be quantified to reflect hDAPK2 activity (<Inbal et al., 2002>). All experiments were carried out in the absence and presence of thapsigargin (TG) (<Figure 6>A), which promotes Ca2+/CaM binding (<Hoyer-Hansen et al., 2007>). As expected, the addition of TG increased blebbing of hDAPK2-expressing cells by more than 3-fold within 5 min. This effect was equally observed regardless of whether hDAPK2 FL or truncated hDAPK2 CD + ARD was used, in line with earlier data (<Shani et al., 2001>). The activity of the hDAPK2 S308A mutant in the absence of TG is similar to that of WT hDAPK2 in the presence of TG. This indicates that when residue 308 can no longer be phosphorylated and ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding can occur, the presence of endogenous Ca2+/CaM in HEK293T cells is sufficient to promote unrestrained hDAPK2-mediated blebbing. By contrast, blebbing is largely impaired in the hDAPK2 W305D mutant, even in the presence of TG, as ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding is abolished."
PMC4906247_3,"The hDAPK2 D220K mutant is as active as WT hDAPK2 in the presence of TG  Moreover, in the absence of TG its activity is even markedly enhanced compared with WT hDAPK2, approaching the effects seen in hDAPK2 S308A. As this hDAPK2 mutant leads to weakening of the hDAPK2 dimer interface without negatively affecting Ca2+/CaM binding, we assume that in the D220K variant, CD residues from the BL that are crucial for CD-mediated Ca2+/CaM interactions become more accessible to bind endogenous Ca2+/CaM in HEK293T cells and promote activity. However, this effect is suppressed when the D220K mutation is combined with the W305D mutation, which is in agreement with our FA data, and suggests that Ca2+/CaM binding is dominated by ARD-mediated interactions.Residual blebbing activity of the hDAPK2 BL mutant remained even below that measured for the hDAPK2 W305D mutant both in the absence and presence of TG, which reconfirms the essential role of the BL in hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM binding. Activity of the hDAPK2 BL mutant could not be restored by combining it with either hDAPK2 S308A or hDAPK2 D220K. This is in agreement with our FA data and demonstrates the essential role of the hDAPK2 BL in Ca2+/CaM binding. Similarly, the blebbing activity of the hDAPK2 L226R mutant remained residual. As hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM binding is not affected in this mutant (<Figures 5>C and 5D), the most plausible explanation is that L226 is involved in protein-substrate binding during catalysis, as this residue is situated close to the substrate-binding site (<Figure 3>) (<Temmerman et al., 2013>). In summary, our data demonstrate that DAPK2 catalytic activity is regulated by Ca2+/CaM interactions with both the ARD and the BL of the CD, thus coupling the hDAPK2 ability for dimerization and Ca2+/CaM binding with hDAPK2 function (<Figure 6>B). We have identified and characterized a new type of serine/threonine kinase CD-mediated homodimeric arrangement that is shared by the three most closely related members of the DAPK family: DAPK1, DAPK2, and DAPK3 (<Figure 1>). Such an assembly has not been found in any other protein kinases and hence seems to be driven by specific DAPK features, such as the BL signature motif. It is different from the previously found dimerization arrangement via swapping of the activation loop between two adjacent kinase domains (<Oliver et al., 2007>, <Pike et al., 2008>).DAPK Ca2+/CaM binding and activity is associated with the disassembly of the homodimer into the monomeric state. When investigating the effect of CD monomerization on hDAPK2 activity in more detail, we found a second micromolar-affinity Ca2+/CaM-binding site that indeed originates from the BL (<Figure 5>). Comparison of the specific interactions found in these two sites reveals that the ARD-mediated interactions with Ca2+/CaM are much more extensive. This explains why the affinities of the two interaction sites vary by more than three orders of magnitude (<Figures 5>C and 5D). These data also confirm the unusual versatility of CaM as a scaffold that is able to bind to many proteins with different surfaces and highly adaptive conformations (<Yamniuk and Vogel, 2004>).Remarkably, when the BL is mutated such that the CD-mediated Ca2+/CaM interaction site is impaired, hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM binding is completely abolished, despite the presence of the nM-affinity ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM interaction site. Our data are thus arguing in favor of a model in which ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding is not autonomous of the overall hDAPK2 structure, which was not expected based on previous data mostly on kinase ARD peptide-Ca2+/CaM complexes (<Dagher et al., 2011>, <Kuczera and Kursula, 2012>, <Yamniuk and Vogel, 2004>). Indeed, in the hDAPK1-Ca2+/CaM complex structure, it was initially shown that ARD-mediated binding requirements for Ca2+/CaM are different from isolated ARD peptides due to steric clashes with the hDAPK1 CD (<de Diego et al., 2010>). Thus, the interpretation of Ca2+/CaM-binding data with synthetic ARD peptides requires caution in terms of their relevance under physiological conditions.As our functional analysis focused on hDAPK2, we next asked to what extent a CD-mediated dimerization module is part of a common regulatory mechanism for members of the DAPK family. In the two DAPK members that are regulated by Ca2+/CaM—hDAPK1 and hDAPK2—this mechanism would involve the inhibition of CD-mediated dimerization, the activation of CD-mediated and ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding, and a conserved pattern of two phosphorylation sites in the ARD (Ser289, Ser308) with opposing effects on activity regulation (<Simon et al., 2015>). An analysis of all earlier structures deposited in the PDB reveals that indeed all available DAPK2 structures (PDB: 1WMK, 1Z9X, 1ZWS, 2A27, and 2CKE) show the same type of dimer assembly that we found, confirming the relevance of the data presented here under a broad range of different experimental conditions used for structural analysis.By contrast, for hDAPK1 there is a substantially higher level of diversity in terms of possible arrangements. Among the 30 deposited DAPK1 structures, we found three with an alternative dimer interface (PDB: 1JKT, 2Y4P, and 3ZXT), which is that of the canonical serine/threonine kinase dimer arrangement by activation segment exchange (<Pike et al., 2008>). Several other hDAPK1 PDB entries are even monomeric. This is supported by a comparative SEC experiment under the conditions we have established here showing that hDAPK1 tends to be considerably more monomeric than hDAPK2 (<Figure S3>). An analysis of the level of specific dimeric interface interactions indicates an almost complete lack in the hDAPK1 dimer, compared with those found in hDAPK2 (<Table S2>). Therefore, we speculate that the inhibition of CD-mediated homodimerization of hDAPK1 may have a less pronounced role in regulating hDAPK1 activity than other family members.We next investigated whether the complementation of the high-affinity ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding by the BL-mediated Ca2+/CaM-binding site is generally applicable to other Ca2+/CaM-regulated protein kinases. The highly conserved pattern of four positively charged BL residues in DAPK1 and DAPK2 (<Figure 3>) is suggestive of a common CD-mediated Ca2+/CaM-binding site in both these kinases. Our previous structural data on the hDAPK1-Ca2+/CaM complex (<de Diego et al., 2010>) together with the hDAPK2 Ca2+/CaM-binding data from this work support this hypothesis.Moreover, our findings are mirrored in CaMKII in terms of a generally applicable mechanism of dual low- and high-affinity Ca2+/CaM binding. In this prototype kinase, the ARD high-affinity Ca2+/CaM-binding site is occluded from the dodecameric assembly of the unphosphorylated holoenzyme (<Chao et al., 2011>). CaMKII phosphorylation of Thr286, located in a loop N-terminal to the canonical ARD high-affinity Ca2+/CaM interaction site, leads to a 1,000-fold increase in Ca2+/CaM-binding affinity, described as Ca2+/CaM trapping (<Meyer et al., 1992>). This triggers a cascade of phosphorylation of further ARD residues, followed by Ca2+/CaM disassembly and acquisition of Ca2+-independent kinase activity, which has been described as an autonomous activity state (<Stratton et al., 2013>). Given that the high-affinity ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM interaction site is conserved in CaMKII and DAPK2 and in both kinases a low-affinity Ca2+/CaM-binding state can be detected, it may be interesting to reveal to what extent there are analogies. Conformation-dependent accessibility of known sites for Ca2+/CaM binding seems to be a crucial parameter. However, since in the structure of the CaMKII CD + ARD-Ca2+/CaM complex the ARD-Ca2+/CaM module is entirely separate (<Rellos et al., 2010>), ultimately this question can probably only be resolved by a still awaited structure of the CaMKII holo-Ca2+/CaM complex.Taking earlier data and those of this contribution together, we propose an extended model of DAPK activity regulation, which so far has been fully demonstrated here for hDAPK2 (<Figure 7>)."
PMC4906247_4,"It builds on previously established general mechanisms of regulation, including ARD phosphorylation, ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding, and conformational switches in the CD region covering helix αD (<de Diego et al , 2010>, <Shani et al., 2001>, <Simon et al., 2015>). In our extended model, the monomeric state of a dynamic dimer/monomer equilibrium is the active form that allows CD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding (<Figure 7>, steps 1 and 2). This equilibrium may vary between different members of the DAPK family in which dimerization has been observed, as indicated by our structural comparison above. BL-mediated Ca2+/CaM interactions are a prerequisite for high-affinity ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding (<Figure 7>, step 3), resulting in a structural arrangement found previously (<de Diego et al., 2010>). What hinders autonomous ARD-mediated Ca2+/CaM interactions in the absence of CD-mediated Ca2+/CaM binding at the molecular level is not yet fully understood. This could result from pseudosubstrate-type interactions of the N-terminal part of the ARD with the CD active-site area, as observed in various CD + ARD structures of members of the DAPK family, which may occlude the ARD segment from being accessible for Ca2+/CaM binding. Independently from this, Ser308, which serves as one of the key ARD-Ca2+/CaM interactions sites, must not be phosphorylated. The last step (<Figure 7>, step 4), full activation of DAPK through the release of the Ca2+/CaM-bound ARD module from the CD surface, is required to allow full access of protein substrates, but this step still needs to be verified by structural data. Based on the structure of the hDAPK1-Ca2+/CaM complex (<de Diego et al., 2010>), Ser289 phosphorylation would inevitably lead to such a fully active state, which is supported by recent data on hDAPK2 (<Isshiki et al., 2012>). Whether this is accompanied by a conformational change in ARD-bound Ca2+/CaM, as observed in several kinase ARD peptide-Ca2+/CaM complexes, also remains to be determined.Our data agree with other established kinase dimerization models that functionally couple dimerization with activity regulation (<Endicott et al., 2012>). However, whereas dimerization by activation segment swapping in other serine/threonine protein kinases promotes specific activation upon segment phosphorylation (<Oliver et al., 2007>, <Pike et al., 2008>), there is no phosphorylation site in the equivalent sequence segment in hDAPK1 and hDAPK2. Our data are restricted to one member of the DAPK family (hDAPK2) and only take the CD and ARD segments into account. All members of the DAPK family investigated here—DAPK1, DAPK2, and DAPK3—have additional domain segments in their C-terminal regions with unrelated oligomerization properties, and an overall model for their involvement in regulation has been proposed (<Shiloh et al., 2014>).The logical next step will be to investigate our findings in the context of the respective full-length DAPK proteins. From a potential drug discovery point of view, these additional sites for activity regulation could provide promising starting points for the rational design of novel inhibitors. About 15% of all human protein kinases are estimated to be regulated by calcium-bound calmodulin (CaM), demonstrating the significance of connecting calcium-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent signaling processes. Common to most of those kinases is that CaM is bound to a small, separate, and highly conserved autoregulatory segment C-terminal to the kinase domain. Previous data indicated that CaM binding to this segment is modular and independent from the neighboring kinase domain, raising questions regarding how this could be coupled with other known mechanisms of kinase activity regulation. In this study, we searched for mechanistic principles of connecting different types of kinase activity regulation such as phosphorylation and oligomerization by investigating CaM-regulated members of the DAPK family. In DAPK2, which we took as a model, we discovered a novel CaM-binding site mediated by a common DAPK family signature loop with low-micromolar affinity. As this loop is also involved in DAPK2 kinase dimerization, monomerization promotes CaM binding. Surprisingly, when this kinase-mediated CaM-binding site is impaired there is also no CaM binding to the well-established autoregulatory segment, challenging previous assumptions on modular, autonomous CaM binding to regulate kinase activity. Our data generate an integrated four-step model in DAPK activity regulation: (1) kinase domain-mediated homo-dimerization, (2) kinase-mediated CaM binding, (3) autoregulatory segment-mediated CaM binding, and (4) DAPK phosphorylation of specific residues sites. Comparison of our findings with other prototype CaM-dependent protein kinases is indicative that dual and coupled CaM-mediated kinase activity regulation could present a general principle of kinase activity regulation. The discovery of the kinase-mediated CaM-binding site opens novel opportunities for targeting this site by small-molecular inhibitors and subsequent drug discovery approaches. The hDAPK1 construct comprising the CD and most of the autoregulatory domain (CD + ARD, residues 1–312) was expressed from a pET9a-derived vector encoding an N-terminal hexahistidine tag with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and grown at 25°C overnight.

The products, corresponding to hDAPK2 comprising the CD and autoregulatory domain (CD + ARD, residues 10–330) and hDAPK3 comprising the CD (CD, residues 1–274), were subcloned into the Gateway system (Invitrogen) vector pDEST-15, with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag. The recombinant proteins were expressed in the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strain at 20°C, inducing with 0.4 mM IPTG overnight. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl, after lysis and centrifugal clarification. The recombinant protein in the supernatant was bound to glutathione Sepharose-4B (GE Healthcare). After washing with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer, elution was performed by TEV protease cleavage. Both proteins were further purified by SEC using an S75 10/600 Gl column (GE Healthcare).For analytical SEC, SAXS, and CaM pull-down and FA assays, hDAPK2 CD + ARD was amplified from its pcDNA vector (<Shani et al., 2001>) by PCR and cloned into pETM14 for expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) star pRARE2.

We used the calcium/calmodulin-dependent members of the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) family to investigate the role of a basic DAPK signature loop near the kinase active site. In DAPK2, this loop comprises a novel dimerization-regulated calcium/calmodulin-binding site, in addition to a well-established calcium/calmodulin site in the C-terminal autoregulatory domain. Unexpectedly, impairment of the basic loop interaction site completely abolishes calcium/calmodulin binding and DAPK2 activity is reduced to a residual level, indicative of coupled binding to the two sites. This contrasts with the generally accepted view that kinase calcium/calmodulin interactions are autonomous of the kinase catalytic domain. Our data establish an intricate model of multi-step kinase activation and expand our understanding of how calcium binding connects with other mechanisms involved in kinase activity regulation. rhetorical Members of the DAPK family share a specific basic-loop-mediated dimerization motif DAPK2 contains a kinase-mediated and dimerization-regulated CaM-binding site Autoregulatory segment CaM binding depends on kinase-mediated CaM binding DAPK2 activity is regulated by coupled CaM binding to two different sites Simon et al. show that human death-associated protein kinase activity is regulated by coupled binding of calcium/calmodulin to two distinct sites, a novel kinase-mediated site and an autoregulatory segment-mediated site, and thus establish a new link to the role of calcium in kinase signaling. ."
PMC4983528_0,"Conformational changes involving the amino terminus of the tau protein are among the earliest alterations associated with tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. This region of tau contains a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) that is aberrantly exposed in pathological forms of the protein, an event that is associated with disruptions in anterograde fast axonal transport. We utilized four antibodies that recognize the amino terminus of tau, TNT1, TNT2 (a novel antibody), Tau12, and Tau13, to further study this important region. Using scanning alanine mutations in recombinant tau proteins, we refined the epitopes of each antibody. We examined the antibodies’ relative abilities to specifically label pathological tau in non-denaturing and denaturing assays to gain insight into some of the mechanistic details of PAD exposure. We then determined the pattern of tau pathology labeled by each antibody in human hippocampal sections at various disease stages in order to characterize PAD exposure in the context of disease progression. The characteristics of reactivity for the antibodies fell into two groups. TNT1 and TNT2 recognized epitopes within amino acids 7–12 and specifically identified recombinant tau aggregates and pathological tau from Alzheimer’s disease brains in a conformation-dependent manner. These antibodies labeled early pre-tangle pathology from neurons in early Braak stages and colocalized with thiazine red, a marker of fibrillar pathology, in classic neurofibrillary tangles. However, late tangles were negative for TNT1 and TNT2 indicating a loss of the epitope in later stages of tangle evolution. In contrast, Tau12 and Tau13 both identified discontinuous epitopes in the amino terminus and were unable to differentiate between normal and pathological tau in biochemical and tissue immunohistological assays. Despite the close proximity of these epitopes, the antibodies demonstrated remarkably different abilities to identify pathological changes in tau indicating that detection of conformational alterations involving PAD exposure is not achieved by all N-terminal tau antibodies and that a relatively discrete region of the N-terminus (i.e., amino acids 7–12, the TNT1 and TNT2 epitope) is central to the differences between normal and pathological tau. The appearance of PAD in early tau pathology and its disappearance in late-stage tangles suggest that toxic forms of tau are associated with the earliest forms of tau deposits. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the TNT antibodies are useful markers for early conformational display of PAD and provide information regarding conformational changes that have potential implications in the toxic mechanisms of tau pathology.

We gratefully acknowledge the late Lester “Skip” Binder for deepening our understanding of the tau protein and his long-lasting impact on the field through his numerous contributions (including some of the antibodies used here), Tessa Grabinski for her technical help with purifying tau antibodies, and Peter Davies for the Alz50 antibody. We would like to acknowledge the Neuropathology Core in the Alzheimer Disease Core Center at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, for providing the human brain tissue. <Supplementary data>  to this article can be found online at  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2016.05.016 . Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological aggregation of tau protein and the amyloid-β peptide leading to the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular senile plaques, respectively (<Braak and Braak, 1991>). There is an association between tau pathology deposition and loss of cells and synapses, but a growing body of evidence suggests that NFTs may not be the cause of neurotoxicity (<Bobinski et al., 1997>; <Bussiere et al., 2003>; <Gomez-Isla et al., 1997>; <Morsch et al., 1999>; <Santacruz et al., 2005>; <Spires-Jones et al., 2008>; <Wittmann et al., 2001>; <Yoshiyama et al., 2007>). Therefore, it is important to understand how the early pre-tangle alterations in tau may lead to toxicity and why this toxicity is apparently lost or reduced in mature fibrillar pathology.Changes in tau conformation may play an important role in the development of early tau pathology and tau-mediated toxicity. Tau is traditionally described as a disordered protein; however, evidence suggests that tau proteins fold into multiple conformations. Initial evidence of tau folding was derived from the description of the discontinuous Alz50 and MC1 epitopes, which label otherwise normal-appearing neurons early in disease progression and prior to NFT formation (<Carmel et al., 1996>; <Hyman et al., 1988>; <Jicha et al., 1999>, <1997>). The disease specificity of these two antibodies indicated that tau undergoes a conformational change involving a close association of the N-terminus and microtubule-binding domains in Alzheimer’s disease. More recently, a global conformation known as the global hairpin or “paperclip” conformation, where the N- and C-termini are in close proximity and the C-terminus and microtubule-binding domains are interacting, was described (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>). Folding of the N-terminus into this conformation is impaired by mimicking phosphorylation epitopes (e.g. the AT8 site) associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<Goedert et al., 1995>; <Greenberg et al., 1992>; <Jeganathan et al., 2008>; <Mercken et al., 1992>).Changes in the conformations of tau are particularly important because they can directly affect the function of the protein and its toxic role in disease. One key example involves the recently identified phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) motif, seated in the extreme N-terminus of tau, whose exposure depends upon changes in tau folding (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). Recently, we developed a monoclonal antibody, Tau N-terminal 1 (TNT1), which identifies PAD exposure in non-denaturing assays (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). Evidence from the TNT1 antibody suggests that PAD is exposed in pathological forms of tau, including aggregated recombinant tau and tau from AD brains, but not monomeric recombinant tau and tau isolated from non-demented human brains (<Kanaan et al., 2015>, <2012>, <2011>). Aberrant exposure of this motif in disease-related forms of tau disrupts fast axonal transport, a process critical to neuron function and viability, through a signaling cascade involving PP1 and GSK3 (<Kanaan et al., 2011>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>). This links a direct toxic mechanism with conformational changes exposing the N-terminus of the protein and induced by pathological alterations in tau (e.g. aggregation or phosphorylation). This has shifted our focus to establishing how presentation of PAD is affected in Alzheimer’s disease and its implications for progression of the disease.In order to identify some mechanistic details of PAD exposure, we performed a detailed characterization of several N-terminal tau antibodies (TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13) for their abilities to differentially recognize pathological, PAD-exposed tau or normal forms of the tau protein. The epitopes of these antibodies displayed distinct patterns of reactivity despite only small differences in their epitopes. The TNT1 (<Kanaan et al., 2011>) and TNT2 (a newly described reagent) antibodies displayed strong, conformation-dependent reactivity with pathological forms of tau, but not normal tau in non-denaturing assays. In contrast, Tau12 (<Horowitz et al., 2004>) and Tau13 (<Ghoshal et al., 2002>) did not detect differences between pathological and normal tau, demonstrating that not all N-terminal antibodies are useful for this purpose and the relevant conformational changes involve, and may be limited to, amino acids 7–12. The TNT antibodies labeled diffuse, pre-tangle pathology in hippocampal tissue sections from Braak stages I–VI cases."
PMC4983528_1,"The TNT1 and TNT2 antibodies colocalized with pathology identified by the early, conformation-specific Alz50 antibody, and remained in classical NFTs but did not co-label in thiazine red (ThR)-positive late-stage NFTs (e g. ghost tangles). These findings demonstrate that TNT1 and TNT2 are useful reagents to differentiate normal from pathological, PAD-exposed forms of the tau protein, and that PAD exposure is an early conformational change in tau that occurs as pathology begins to accumulate in neurons. The full-length human tau protein construct (2N4R/hT40) containing a C-terminal 6xHis tag in the pT7 plasmid was used to produce recombinant tau protein as described (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). Site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Quikchange Lightning, Santa Clara, CA, 210519-5) was used to introduce the following mutations in the hT40 construct: E3A, P4A, R5A, Q6A, E7A, FE8-9AA, V10A, M11A, E12A, D13A/H14A/A15A/G16A/T17A (X13-17A), Y18A/G19A/L20A/G21A (X18-21A), or D22A/R23A/K24A (X22-24A). In addition, wild-type versions of the other five human tau isoform proteins (2N3R/hT39, 1N4R/hT34, 1N3R/hT37, 0N4R/hT24, and 0N3R/hT23) were produced. These constructs were transformed into T7 Express competent cells (New England Biosciences, Ipswich, MA, C2566I). 125 ml of Luria Broth was inoculated with the bacteria and grown overnight at 25 °C until it reached an OD600 value of 0.8–1.0. IPTG was added to the flask at a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min, washed with saline buffer and centrifuged again at 8000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was frozen at −80 °C. The cells were resuspended in buffer (50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Tris, and 500 nM imidazole, with protease inhibitors at 10 μg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin, and 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication (20 pulses of 5 s each at power setting of 3, Misonix XL-2000) on ice. Protease inhibitors were again added to the lysate at the same concentrations as above along with Brij 35 to 0.1%. The sample was then centrifuged at 107,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protease inhibitors and 10% glycerol were added to the supernatant before loading it onto 1 ml of Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, #635502). After a 20 ml buffer wash, the protein was eluted into 1 ml fractions by adding 10 ml of elution buffer (50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Tris, and 100 mM imidazole with 2 mM PMSF). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining and fractions with protein were combined and dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to 1 mM final concentration.Protein concentrations were determined by SDS Lowry where 200 μl of the proteins were added to 200 μl of SDS solution (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8), respectively, along with buffer-only blank samples. Protein standards of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 μg were generated using a 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) stock (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #23209) and adding SDS solution to a total volume of 100 μl. 1 ml of 10% perchloric acid/1% phosphotungstic acid was added to each sample, vortexed, and briefly spun in microcentrifuge before a 1 h incubation on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was removed. After the protein pellet had completely dried, it was dissolved in 1 ml of Lowry solution (0.01% CuSO4, 0.02% sodium potassium tartate, and 2% sodium carbonate in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide) and incubated at RT for 10 min. 100 μl of Folin–Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent (diluted 1:1 in water, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, F9252) was added and incubated for 30–45 min at RT. 100 μl of each sample was added, in duplicate, to a clear 96-well plate and the absorbances were read at 750 nm. The total protein concentrations were interpolated from the BSA standard curve (r2 = 0.98). The protein was aliquoted into 10–50 μl and frozen at −80 °C. An adult male Sprague–Dawley rat (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, 002), an adult male C57BL/6J mouse (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, 000664), and an adult male tau knockout mouse (The Jackson Laboratory, 007251) were used to obtain brain lysate samples. The animals were sacrificed approximately 7 days after delivery and were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline with heparin (10,000 U/L) to clear the blood. The frontal cortex was microdissected and stored at −80 °C until processed for generating brain lysate samples for characterizing N-terminal antibodies (see below). All animal studies were performed in accordance with standard regulations and were approved by the Michigan State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. This is the first description of the novel mouse monoclonal TNT2 antibody. TNT2 was generated by immunizing mice with a peptide of amino acids 2–18 of hT40 (2AEPRQEFEVMEDHAGTY 18) conjugated to KLH as described (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). Briefly, BALB/c female mice (Jackson Laboratories, #001026) were immunized subcutaneously every 3 weeks for 5 months. After immunization, the splenocytes were fused to SP2/o myeloma cells and positive clones that reacted with PAD in indirect ELISAs (as described below) were subcloned four times. Isotype strips were used to determine that TNT2 is an IgG1. A CELLine Classic 1000 bioreactor (Sartorius AG, DC-90005) was used to produce TNT2 before purification with protein A sepharose (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfront, UK, #17-1279-02) using methods similar to those previously described (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). Purified TNT2 was dialyzed into antibody storage buffer (10 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 50% glycerol, pH 7.4), adjusted to 1 mg/ml, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Tissue samples from the frontal cortex of a rat, mouse, and tau knockout mouse (from above) were processed to assess the species cross-reactivity and specificity of TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13. Tissue pieces were homogenized in 375 μl lysis buffer (0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (as above) and phosphatase inhibitors (β-glycerophosphate and sodium orthovanadate at 1 mM) by sonication (power setting = 3, 20 × 5 s pulses on ice). Debris was removed by spinning samples at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was assessed for total protein concentration using the Bradford assay where 1, 2, 4, and 8 μl of sample were diluted to 160 μl of water. Triplicate BSA standards of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μg were generated through serial dilutions from a 2 mg/ml stock. Corresponding control samples were made with lysis buffer at the same volumes as the BSA standards. 160 μl of all samples were incubated with 40 μl of dye solution for 5 min. The absorbances of 160 μl of the sample–reagent mixes were measured at 595 nm in a clear microplate. The absorbances from the buffer-only control samples were subtracted from the BSA standards and samples. Then a linear standard curve was generated from the BSA standard absorbance values (r2 = 0.997). The protein concentrations of the samples were interpolated using the standard curve. Samples were stored at −80 °C until use in western blotting as described below. Recombinant tau monomer and aggregate samples were generated by making a 400 μl reaction with 2 μM hT40 tau containing a C-terminal 6xHis tag in polymerization buffer (5 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 100 μM EDTA, and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.64). The reaction was split in half and 7.5 μl of 2 mM arachidonic acid in ethanol was added to a final concentration of 75 μM in order to induce tau polymerization in the aggregate sample. The monomer sample received 7.5 μl of ethanol as a control. The reactions were allowed to proceed overnight and the extent of aggregation was confirmed using right-angle laser light scattering (<Gamblin et al., 2000>). The aggregated tau sample produced the expected level of light scattering (~150 a.u.). Aliquots of the samples were stored at −80 °C until used in assays outlined below."
PMC4983528_2,"Fresh frozen tissue samples from the frontal cortex of age-matched non-demented (control, n = 6) and severe AD cases (n = 6) were obtained from the Brain Bank of the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Northwestern University (see <Supplemental Table 1> for details on human subjects)  Soluble tau and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions were obtained as described previously (<Kanaan et al., 2015>). The tissue was suspended in 10 volumes of Brain Homgenization Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl with pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin protease inhibitors at 10 μg/ml and PMSF at 1 mM). The tissue was homogenized with a Tissue Tearor Model 985-370 on setting #4 for 3 × 10 s then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was collected (soluble tau) and the pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of 1X Brain Pellet Homogenization Buffer (800 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM PMSF). The pellet was again homogenized at #4 for 3 × 10 s and spun at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Sarkosyl powder (to 1% final amount) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 37 ° C. After the sarkosyl incubation, sample was spun at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Brain Pellet Homogenization buffer as the sarkosyl-insoluble tau fraction. An SDS Lowry protein assay was performed on the soluble tau (4 μl + 96 μl SDS solution) and insoluble tau (using 16 μl + 84 μl SDS solution) fractions, as described above, to determine total protein concentrations. The fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until used in assays outlined below. Indirect ELISAs were used to determine the relative affinities of TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13 antibodies. Recombinant hT40 tau protein monomer was diluted to 2 ng/μl and 50 μl was added to the wells of a 96-well high-binding plate (Corning, Corning, NY, #3590), then incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed 2× with ELISA wash buffer (100 mM boric acid, 25 mM sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 75 mM sodium chloride, 250 μM thimerosal, 0.4% BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BP1600-100), and 0.1% Tween-20). The wells were blocked with 200 μl of 5% non-fat dry milk in wash buffer for 1 h and washed 2×. The primary antibodies were serially diluted in 1:2 intervals from 100 ng/ml to 48.8 pg/ml and 50 μl was added to the wells for 2 h then washed 4× with wash buffer. The wells were then incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, PI-2000) at a dilution of 1:5000, washed 4×, then developed with 50 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma, T0440). The development was stopped after 5 min with 50 μl of 3.6% H2SO4 and absorbance was read at 450 nm. Blank wells without tau protein were used to determine background absorbance. The absorbance values were converted to percent of light absorbed (a linear scale) using the following equation, %A = (1 − 10−x)*100, where x is the absorbance value. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (all r2 > 0.99). Recombinant tau sandwich ELISAs were used to measure the differential reactivity of TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, or Tau13 for monomeric and aggregated tau samples in non-denaturing conditions. Capture antibodies were diluted to 1 ng/μl and 50 μl was added per well in a 96-well plate and allowed to incubate for 1 h. All incubations were carried out at room temperature and on a shaker. The wells were washed 2× in ELISA wash buffer. The wells were blocked with 200 μl of wash buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h and then rinsed 2× with wash buffer. The monomer and aggregated samples were serially diluted in tris buffered saline (TBS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4) from 200 nM to 12.2 pM at 1:4 intervals and 50 μl was added to the wells for 90 min then washed 4× with wash buffer. The detection antibody (R1, a pan-tau polyclonal rabbit antibody (<Berry et al., 2004>)) was diluted at 1:10,000 in milk and 50 μl was added to the plates for 90 min. The wells were washed 4 times and 50 μl of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, PI-2000) detection secondary antibody was added at a 1:5000 dilution in milk for 1 h. Then the wells were washed 4× in wash buffer followed by development with 50 μl of TMB for 5–20 min, stopped with addition of 50 μl of 3.6% H2SO4, and absorbance was read at 450 nm and converted to %A as above. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose–response curve.Sandwich ELISAs were repeated as above, except where noted, with soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from control and AD human brain samples. All capture antibodies (TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, Tau13, and PHF1) were diluted 1:1000 from 1 mg/ml stock solutions. For the soluble tau samples, 50 μl containing 20 μg of total protein (0.4 mg/ml; diluted in borate saline buffer) was added to each well, while 50 μl containing 2.5 μg total protein was used for the sarkosyl-insoluble samples. For 1 control and 2 AD cases, the maximum sample available was 0.03 mg/ml in 50 μl of the control case and 0.016 mg/ml in 50 μl for the AD cases. The R1 tau antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were used as above. The ELISAs were developed for 5–9 min. Since brain lysates contained unknown amounts of tau, independent indirect ELISAs with the R1 detection antibody were performed simultaneously for each capture antibody following the above indirect ELISA method. For these standard curve indirect ELISAs, recombinant hT40 tau monomer samples ranged from 0.98 to 250 ng/well and were detected with the R1 antibody. This provided a standard curve for us to interpolate the amount of tau bound by the capture antibodies in the human sample sandwich ELISAs as described in detail previously (<Kanaan et al., 2015>). The absorbance values from the R1 indirect ELISA standard curve values were fit to a nonlinear one-phase association equation (all r2 > 0.98). The concentrations of tau detected in each of the sandwich ELISAs were interpolated from this standard curve and used for comparisons. For western blots, alanine-scanning mutant recombinant protein samples, hT40 recombinant protein samples and all brain lysate samples were prepared in Laemmli buffer (final 1× composition: 20 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% Bromophenol Blue). All samples were heated at 99 °C for 5 min and separated using Criterion TGX Precast 4–20% gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA, #567-1094 and #567-1095) in SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to BioTrace NT nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Port Washington, NY, #66593) at 400 mA for 50 min. For the scanning alanine mutant protein blots, 400 ng of each protein was loaded for the TNT1, TNT2, and Tau12 blots and 100 ng of protein was loaded for the Tau13 blot. Recombinant samples, containing a C-terminal 6× histidine tag, for each of the tau isoforms (hT40, hT39, hT34, hT37, hT24, and hT23) were diluted to 0.5 μM in TBS and loaded at 20 μl for the isoform blots. The rodent brain lysate tau blots were loaded with 80 μg of total protein for the TNT1 blot and 20 μg of total protein for the TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13 blots. 187 ng of the purified recombinant tau protein monomer and aggregate samples were loaded per lane. The human frontal cortex lysates from controls (n = 3) and AD (n = 3) were loaded at 60 μg/lane of total protein for the TNT1 and TNT2 blots and 20 μg/lane for the Tau12 and Tau13 blots. After a blocking step of 1 h with 2% milk/TBS, the membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. All antibody stocks were 1 mg/ml and diluted in 2% milk/TBS. The scanning alanine mutant blots and tau isoform blots were probed with TNT1 (1:100,000), TNT2 (1:10,000), Tau12 (1:500,000), or Tau13 (1:1,000,000) then reprobed with R1 (1:20,000) to normalize the N-terminal antibody signal for the scanning alanine mutant quantitation."
PMC4983528_3,"The rodent brain lysates were probed with TNT1 (1:100,000), TNT2 (1:25,000), Tau12 (1:500,000), or Tau13 (1:500,000) as well as for GAPDH (1:2000, Cell Signaling D16H11 XP Rb, Danvers, MA) to serve as a loading control  The Tau12 and Tau13 blots were reprobed with R1 (1:100,000) to confirm the presence of tau. The purified recombinant tau monomer and aggregate blots were probed with TNT1 (1:200,000), TNT2 (1:25,000), Tau12 (1:500,000), or Tau13 (1:500,000) and R1 (1:10,000) also was used on all blots. The human frontal cortex lysate blots were incubated with TNT1 (1:100,000), TNT2 (1:10,000), Tau12 (1:500,000), or Tau13 (1:500,000) and also probed for GAPDH (1:2000, Cell Signaling D16H11 XP Rb,) as the loading control to normalize N-terminal tau signals. Blots were rinsed with 0.1% Tween20/TBS and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies diluted 1:20,000 in milk/TBS (IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), #926-68070; and IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), #926-32211; both from Li-Cor Bisciences, Lincoln, NE). Blots were imaged using a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system in the 700 and 800 nm channels at 42 μm resolution. Signal intensity of bands was quantified using Li-Cor ImageStudioLite 5.2 Software. The scanning alanine mutant blot signals were normalized to R1. Three replicates of recombinant monomer and aggregated hT40 were quantified and normalized to R1 signal. The signals from the human frontal cortex control and AD samples were quantified and normalized to GAPDH signals. Hippocampal sections from control (Braak I–II, n = 3), mild AD (Braak III–IV, n = 3), and severe AD (Braak V–VI, n = 3) cases from the Brain Bank of the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Northwestern University (see <Supplemental Table 1> for details on human subjects) were used to evaluate the pattern of IHC staining with TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, Tau13, and PHF1 using established methods (<Kanaan et al., 2012>, <2011>). Wash steps were performed 6× for 10 min in 0.1% Triton-X/TBS between all steps in the procedure. The tissue was washed and then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity for 1 h at RT. The tissue was then blocked in blocking buffer (10% goat serum/2% BSA/0.4% Triton-X in TBS) followed by incubation in the primary antibody (diluted in 2% goat serum/0.1% Triton-X/TBS) overnight at 4 °C. The following dilutions from 1 mg/ml stocks were used: TNT1 1:350,000, TNT2 1:200,000, Tau12 1:450,000, Tau13 1:450,000, PHF1 1:20,000. Initial titering experiments ensured that all antibodies were used at optimal dilutions. The following day, the tissue was incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, BA-9200) diluted 1:500 in 2% goat serum/0.1% Triton-X/TBS for 2 h at RT. Then the tissue was incubated in ABC solution (1 drop of solutions A and B/10 ml, Vector Laboratories, PK-6100) for 1 h at RT followed by development in 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), 0.003% hydrogen peroxide, 0.1% Triton-X/TBS for 8 min. After development, the tissue was mounted and coverslipped with Cytoseal 60 mounting media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #8310-16). Tissue sections from each case were processed simultaneously for each antibody staining to reduce variability between staining runs. Omission of primary antibody was run to ensure that the specificity of the IHC signal was due to tau antibody reactivity, and as expected, no signal was observed with antibody omission (data not shown) as noted previously (<Kanaan et al., 2015>). Tissue sections were imaged at 20× magnification. A reticle (750 × 750 μm) was used to analyze regions in the CA1/CA2 pyramidal neuron layer of each case (total area = 2.8–4.5 mm2). Neurons inside of the region were counted and sorted into groups based on established criteria of the progressive patterns of tau deposition/aggregation in neurons during pathology evolution (<Bancher et al., 1989>, <1991>; <Braak et al., 1994>). Here we used the terminology of Braak and colleagues (<Braak et al., 1994>). Examples of each group are found in <Fig. 5> and <Supplemental Fig. 3>. Neurons staining with a pattern of diffuse, granular cytoplasmic tau pathology, often extending far into the processes, were classified as group 1 cells. Group 2 neurons displayed a combination of granular cytoplasmic pathology and compact inclusions that were rod-like and globular in morphology, along with reduced reactivity in processes. Group 3 neurons were the compact, classic flame-shaped NFTs in the somatodendritic compartment and the cells no longer had reactivity in the distal end of the processes. Neurons beyond this phenotype (e.g. group 4 or ghost tangles, the extracellular remains of neurons that once contained NFTs and that no longer have nuclei) were not readily apparent, which was confirmed with the immunofluorescence studies described below. The total cell density was used as the main comparison across disease stages, and to further determine the relative amount of the different phenotypes (i.e., group 1–3 cells) identified by each antibody, the counts for each phenotype were converted to percent of the total cells labeled for each individual case and the mean values were compared across disease stages. Human hippocampal sections (all of the same cases as in IHC) were co-stained using combinations of markers to confirm whether TNT antibodies colocalize with early and late tau pathology. The first series of sections were triple stained with TNT1, TNT2 or PHF1, ThR, and DAPI. ThR (Sigma–Aldrich, S570435) is a marker for β-pleated sheet protein structure associated with mature tau fibrils (<Mena et al., 1995>), and stored at −20 °C as a 1% stock solution (diluted in dH2O). DAPI, a nuclear marker (<Kapuscinski, 1995>), was stored as a stock solution of 5 mg/ml in DMSO and frozen at −20 °C. The tissue was washed between steps and blocked as above. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% goat serum/0.1% Triton-X/TBS from 1 mg/ml stocks: TNT1 1:15,000, TNT2 1:15,000, or PHF1 1:3000. Initial titering experiments ensured all antibodies were used at optimal dilutions. Then the tissue was incubated in secondary antibody (AlexaFluor goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) 488; 1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, #A-11001) for 2 h at room temperature. The first wash after secondary contained DAPI at a final concentration of 0.5 ng/μl. After the remaining washes, the tissue was rinsed in deionized water for 2 × 3 min then incubated in 0.004% ThR/dH20 for 20 min before 2 × 3 min washes in water. After mounting, autofluorescence was blocked by equilibrating in 70% ethanol for 2 min, incubating in 2% sudan black B, 70% ethanol for 4 min, briefly rinsed 3× in 70% ethanol, and washed in water 2 × 3 min. The slides were coverslipped with Vectashield aqueous mounting media (Vector laboratories, H-1000).A second series of sections was quadruple labeled for TNT1 or TNT2, Alz50, ThR, and DAPI using the same protocol as above with the following primary antibody dilutions from 1 mg/ml stocks: TNT1 1:10,000 and TNT2 1:10,000. The Alz50 antibody, which identifies a discontinuous epitope related to an altered conformation that occurs early during pathological accumulation of tau (<Carmel et al., 1996>; <Hyman et al., 1988>; <Jicha et al., 1997>), was diluted 1:1000 from a 5.7 mg/ml stock. AlexaFluor goat anti-mouse IgM 647 (1:500; Invitrogen, #A-21238) was included with an AlexaFluor goat anti-mouse IgG1 488 (1:500; Invitrogen, #A-21121).All IF-stained tissue was imaged using a Nikon A1+ scanning confocal microscope system equipped with 405, 488, 541, and 640 laser lines and 425–475 nm (DAPI), 500–500 nm (AlexFluor 488), 570–620 nm (ThR), 663–738 (Alz50) emission filter sets. Z-stacks were acquired at 0.5 μm step sizes and images for figures were generated by using the maximum intensity projections. Control sections were performed by omitting a single component (TNT1 antibody, TNT2 antibody, ThR, or Alz50 antibody), and as expected, each signal was specific for the appropriate marker (data not shown) as previously observed (<Kanaan et al., 2015>)."
PMC4983528_4,"All curve fitting and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software  The recombinant hT40 western blot data were compared using a paired t-test (with pairs made from the same reaction mix as described above). The tau concentration values calculated from the human frontal cortex lysate ELISAs (described above) were compared using an unpaired t-test. The human frontal cortex lysate western blot quantitative values were compared using an unpaired t-test. The total cell density data and percentage of cell phenotype data were analyzed for correlations with advancing Braak stage using the Spearman rank correlation test. All tests were two-tailed with significance set at p < 0.05. We used a series of alanine mutant hT40 proteins (between amino acids 2–24) to further refine the epitopes of each antibody (<Fig. 1A>) beyond the previously reported epitopes (all within the first 24 amino acids of tau). Mutation of amino acids 7–12 eliminated TNT1 and TNT2 reactivity, but in general, TNT2 appeared less effective in western blots than TNT1, as indicated by the lower R1 normalized signal values (<Fig. 1A–C>). It is noteworthy that deletion of amino acids 2–18 did not prohibit R1 binding confirming that this polyclonal contains epitopes outside of the extreme amino terminus (<Berry et al., 2004>) and suggests N-terminal antibody labeling will not block R1 binding (<Fig. 1A>). The epitope map for both Tau12 and Tau13 displayed quite different patterns of reactivity compared to TNT1 and TNT2 (<Fig. 1F>). Both antibodies appeared to identify a discontinuous epitope because reactivity was substantially reduced or eliminated in the X8-9A, X13-17A, and X18-21A mutation proteins (<Fig. 1D, E>). Notably, none of the alanine modifications completely eliminated Tau13 reactivity but the antibody did not react with the Δ;2–18 tau protein (deletion of amino acids 2–18) suggesting some reliance on the presence of these amino acids even though the alanine mutations alone were insufficient to completely disrupt binding. Each antibody’s binding affinity was identified using an indirect ELISA with full-length tau protein (<Fig. 1G>). All of the monoclonal N-terminal antibodies tested here are very high-affinity reagents. TNT1 reached half of the binding saturation at 4.86 ng/ml (32.4 pM) and TNT2 at 9.21 ng/ml (61.4 pM). Tau13 demonstrated the strongest affinity for tau, reaching half of its binding saturation at 2.51 ng/ml (16.73 pM) while Tau12 bound half of its maximum at 3.27 ng/ml (21.8 pM). All N-terminal antibodies were specific to tau (i.e., no reactivity with tau knockout lysates) and both TNT antibodies labeled human and rodent tau, while Tau12 and Tau13 were human specific (<Supp. Fig 1>). Next, we measured the abilities of each antibody to detect pathological aggregated forms of tau in a non-denaturing sandwich ELISA. Varying concentrations of monomeric and aggregated full-length recombinant tau protein were incubated with each of the antibodies. The TNT1 and TNT2 antibodies did not capture detectable levels of monomeric tau (TNT1 and TNT2: EC50 = undetermined) except at 200 nM (9.3 ng/μl or 467 ng/well), the highest concentration tested (<Fig. 2A and B>). In contrast, robust reactivity was seen with aggregated tau at much lower concentrations (TNT1: EC50 = 6.0 nM; TNT2: EC50 = 2.6 nM), indicating a clear difference in reactivity between the two states of the tau proteins. Tau12 reacted well with monomeric tau (EC50 = 6.9 nM) and aggregated tau (EC50 = 2.5 nM), but the preference for aggregated over monomeric tau was less robust compared to the TNT antibodies (<Fig. 2C>). Tau13 demonstrated very similar affinities for tau monomers (EC50 = 1.9 nM) and aggregates (EC50 = 1.1 nM) (<Fig. 2D>). The conformation-dependent nature of reactivity with these N-terminal antibodies was confirmed by denaturing the same tau samples used in the ELISAs with SDS, a reducing agent, and heat exposure before immunoblotting. All of the antibodies bound equally well to monomer and aggregated tau samples in a denatured state (<Fig. 2E–F>). Soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from the frontal cortex of age-matched controls and Alzheimer’s disease cases were used in TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, Tau13, and PHF1 non-denaturing sandwich ELISAs to determine the antibodies’ abilities to identify aggregated and soluble pathological forms of tau from the human brain. In the soluble tau fraction, the TNT1 and TNT2 antibodies detected significantly more soluble tau in the Alzheimer’s disease brain lysates compared to the control samples (<Fig. 3A>). In contrast, Tau12 and Tau13 reacted equally as well to tau in the control and Alzheimer’s disease samples. PHF1 was included for its ability to specifically identify pathological forms of tau and, like TNT1 and TNT2, its signal was significantly greater in samples from Alzheimer’s disease cases when compared to age-matched controls. Next, the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were assayed in the sandwich ELISAs with each antibody. All of the tested antibodies detected significantly more insoluble tau from the Alzheimer’s disease cases when compared to control cases (<Fig. 3B>). Finally, the conformation dependence of reactivity for TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13 was confirmed using denaturing western blots of the soluble tau samples from three of the same control and Alzheimer’s disease cases. All of the antibodies displayed similar recognition of tau from the control and Alzheimer’s disease brain lysates in denaturing conditions (<Fig. 3C–D>). The signal intensities were normalized to GAPDH signals to account for any differences in sample loading. This is in direct contrast to the non-denaturing ELISAs where TNT1 and TNT2 had dramatically stronger reactivity to tau in Alzheimer’s disease lysates compared to control lysates (<Fig. 3A–B>). The pan-tau antibody, R1, was used to confirm similar levels of tau that were present in control and Alzheimer’s disease samples. The normalized intensities associated with Tau12 and Tau13 were much higher than those of TNT1 and TNT2 even though less total lysate was loaded indicating better performance in denaturing western blots. The relatively weak labeling by TNT1 and TNT2 in human sample western blotting may appear to suggest they do not recognize all tau isoforms. We used western blotting to probe recombinant tau isoform proteins (hT40, hT39, hT34, hT37, hT24, and hT23) with TNT1, TNT2, Tau12. and Tau13 to address this concern. Each of these N-terminal antibodies labeled all six human isoforms (<Supp. Fig. 2>). Next, we aimed to establish the pattern of tau pathology labeled by each N-terminal antibody and PHF1 in human hippocampal brain slices from Braak stages I–II, II–IV, and V–VI cases. TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, Tau13, and PHF1 labeled the typical forms of Alzheimer’s disease tau pathology, including NFTs, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques (<Fig. 4A–O>). As expected, the total number of cells containing TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, Tau13, and PHF1 showed strong positive correlations with advancing Braak stage (<Fig. 4P>, see figure legend for statistics). One distinct difference between the TNT antibodies and Tau12 or Tau13 was the extent of parenchymal tau labeled. TNT1 (<Fig. 4A, F, K>) and TNT2 (<Fig. 4B, G, L>) label little to no parenchymal tau, while both Tau12 (<Fig. 4C, H, M>) and Tau13 (<Fig. 4D, I, N>) robustly label parenchymal tau, which is presumably non-pathological or normal tau within the tissue. Similar to the TNT antibodies, PHF1 did not readily label parenchymal tau (<Fig. 4E, J, O>).We quantified neurons of specific tau pathology phenotypes based on established criteria describing neurons as group 1 (early pre-tangles, <Fig. 5A>), group 2 (intermediate tangles, <Fig. 5B>), and group 3 (classic mature tangles, <Fig. 5C>) (<Braak et al., 1994>). Additional representative high-magnification images of neurons from groups 1–3 (taken from a Braak stage III–IV case) are displayed in <Supplemental Fig. 3>. The data are presented as a percentage of the total cells to compare changes in the proportion of each phenotype across the Braak stages (<Fig. 5D–H>)."
PMC4983528_5,"The percentage of TNT1-, TNT2-, Tau12-, Tau13-, and PHF1-positive group 1 neurons showed strong, significant negative correlations with Braak stages, while group 3 cells showed a strong, significant positive correlation with increasing Braak stage (<Table 1>)  None of the group 2 cells were significantly correlated with Braak stage, except PHF1 group 2 neurons, which showed a strong, significant negative correlation (<Table 1>).The majority of TNT1-positive cells were group 1 (59%) and 2 (41%) cells compared to group 3 (0.5%) cells in Braak stage I–II cases (<Fig. 5D>). In Braak III–IV cases, TNT1 labeled similar but decreasing proportions of each phenotype (group 1: 42%, group 2: 33%, group 3: 25%), while the majority were group 3 cells (55%) when compared to group 1 (21%) and 2 (24%) cells in Braak V–VI cases. Similarly, TNT2 primarily labeled group 1 (57%) and group 2 (29%) cells compared to group 3 (15%) cells in Braak I–II cases, while similar amounts of each phenotype were labeled (group 1: 42%, group 2: 27%, group 3: 31%) in Braak III–IV cases (<Fig. 5E>). In Braak V–VI cases, the majority were group 3 cells (group 1: 32%, group 2: 29%, group 3: 39%). Tau12 labeled more group 1 cells (58%) compared to group 2 (33%) and group 3 cells (10%) in Braak I–II cases (<Fig. 5F>). The antibody labeled more group 3 cells (51%) compared to groups 1 (21%) and 2 (28%) cells in Braak III–IV and more group 3 cells (52%) compared to group 1 (19%) and 2 (30%) cells in Braak V–VI cases as well. Tau13 labeled more group 1 cells (72%) compared to group 2 (28%) and 3 cells (0.6%) in Braak I–II cases (<Fig. 5G>). Similar proportions of each phenotype (group 1: 29%, group 2: 40%, group 3: 31%) were identified with Tau13 in Braak III–IV cases, while in Braak V–VI cases, more group 3 cells (55%) were labeled when compared to group 1 (15%) and 2 (30%) cells. PHF1 stained similar amounts of all three cell phenotypes in Braak I–II (group 1: 28%, group 2: 45%, group 3: 26%) and mostly group 3 cells (48%) in Braak stages III–IV cases (group 1: 22%, group 2: 31%, <Fig. 5H>). There was a robust shift in the proportion of PHF1-labeled group 3 cells (89%) when compared to group 1 (2%) and 2 (9%) cells in Braak stage V–VI cases. We performed a series of immunofluorescence co-labeling experiments with TNT1 or TNT2 and ThR, and qualitative evaluations of sections (using the same cases as in IHC) were performed to identify the different cell phenotypes and to confirm whether TNT1 and TNT2 recognize PAD exposure in early pre-tangle pathology (representative images are displayed in <Figs. 6> and <7>). TNT1 and TNT2 both labeled early tau pathology in all disease stages, but the TNT1 and TNT2 reactivity was lost in several late-stage NFTs, many of which lacked nuclei suggesting they were ghost tangles (<Figs. 6> and <7>). In the Braak I–II cases, TNT1 and TNT2 presented a diffuse, granular staining pattern that is characteristic of group 1 neurons (<Figs. 6A> and <7A>). These inclusions were ThR negative, indicating a lack of mature fibrillary tau aggregates containing β-sheet structures. Neurons presenting the granular tau staining pattern were still present in Braak III–IV cases but more compact pathology also appeared (<Figs. 6B> and <7B>) that was positive for ThR (i.e., group 2 and 3 cells). In Braak V–VI cases, a third distinct population of cells appeared that were ThR positive but negative for TNT1 or TNT2 (likely late group 3 cells or ghost tangles; <Figs. 6C> and <7C>). We also performed IF staining in hippocampal sections with PHF1 and ThR (<Supp. Fig. 4>). Like the TNT antibodies, the PHF1 phosphoepitope was present in early pre-tangle group 1 cells that were ThR negative in all Braak stages and also present in ThR-positive group 2 and 3 cells in later Braak stages (<Supp. Fig. 4>). However, ThR-positive cells that were PHF1 negative were infrequent and several apparent ghost tangles remained PHF1-reactive (<Supp. Fig. 4I–L>).Next, we performed multi-label IF with TNT1 or TNT2, ThR, DAPI, and the Alz50 antibody, an established tau conformation-specific antibody that appears in early pre-tangle neurons, to further confirm that TNT1 and TNT2 labeled early tau pathology (<Carmel et al., 1996>; <Hyman et al., 1988>; <Jicha et al., 1997>). Both TNT1 and TNT2 showed extensive colocalization with Alz50 in all stages of the disease (<Supp. Figs. 5 and 6>). As above, there were three distinct populations of cells found through the Braak stages: TNT1+/TNT2+, Alz50+ and ThR−(group 1 cells), TNT1+/TNT2+, Alz50+, and ThR+ (group 2 and 3 cells), or TNT1−/TNT2−, Alz50−, and ThR+ (late group 3 or ghost tangles). Tau dysfunction is likely a key mediator of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies; however, the mechanisms of tau toxicity are not entirely clear. Historically, the amino terminus of tau has largely been ignored, with most of the focus placed on the microtubule-binding domains due to their involvement in microtubule binding and β-sheet formation in tau aggregates. Previous work established that the N-terminus is important for other biological functions of tau and tau’s role in disease pathogenesis (<Brandt et al., 1995>; <Horowitz et al., 2006>). More recently, our group established that the first 18 amino acids of tau comprise a biologically active motif, called the phosphatase-activating domain or PAD, and exposure of this motif is both necessary and sufficient to disrupt anterograde fast axonal transport in squid axoplasm (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). PAD exposure initiated a PP1-GSK3β signaling cascade that resulted in phosphorylation of kinesin light chain and dissociation of bound cargoes (<Kanaan et al., 2011>). These studies highlight important characteristics of the amino terminus and suggest that this region of the molecule is critical in understanding tau-mediated toxicity. Thus, we have recently shifted our focus to the PAD motif and here we utilized several N-terminal tau antibodies to examine details about PAD exposure in the context of human disease. Performing a detailed characterization of the epitopes of TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13 was the first step in establishing the differences between these antibodies and determining their abilities to identify PAD exposure. A peptide of amino acids 2–18 in tau was used to raise TNT1 and TNT2, but through the use of a scanning alanine mutation approach, we refined the epitope of both TNT antibodies to amino acids 7–12. Mutations at the edges of the TNT1 and TNT2 epitopes partially disrupted antibody binding, and overall, these antibodies were not as effective in denaturing western blots compared to Tau12 and Tau13, further supporting that optimal TNT1 and TNT2 reactivity is dependent on native conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that all of these N-terminal antibodies were specific for tau (no reactivity in tau knockout mouse samples) and both TNT antibodies cross-react with mouse and rat tau, despite two amino acid differences (i.e., E9D and V10T) between human and rodent tau.Using larger deletion constructs, the Tau12 epitope was previously mapped to amino acids 2–23 (<Horowitz et al., 2004>) and the Tau13 epitope to within amino acids 9–18 (<Garcia-Sierra et al., 2003>; <Ghoshal et al., 2002>). The alanine mutation approach showed that Tau12 and Tau13 have discontinuous epitopes composed of amino acids 8–9 and 13–21, but some differences were noted. For example, changing amino acids 8 and 9 completely disrupted reactivity of Tau12 but not Tau13. In fact, the reactivity of the Tau13 antibody was not completely abolished with any of these discrete modifications, likely due to the very high affinity of this antibody (highest of those tested here). However, coupling these data with previous deletion construct data (<Garcia-Sierra et al., 2003>; <Ghoshal et al., 2002>), as well as a lack of reactivity to the Δ2–18 tau deletion construct shown here, suggests that the important amino acids in the Tau13 epitope are 8–9 and 13–21. Both Tau12 and Tau13 are sensitive and, as previously reported (<Petry et al., 2014>), human-specific antibodies (i.e."
PMC4983528_6,", lack reactivity with all rodent tau), which is consistent with the absence of human amino acids 19–28 in rodent tau and further supports a distinction between the epitope of these and the TNT antibodies  Previously, we have shown that TNT1 is a marker of PAD exposure and that this event occurs early in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Establishing whether this was true for all N-terminal antibodies was important for understanding more about PAD exposure in Alzheimer’s disease. We significantly extend these findings with TNT1 and show that TNT2 behaves similarly as a marker of PAD exposure. In contrast, other N-terminal antibodies, with slightly different epitopes, do not function as pathological, PAD exposure-specific markers and recognize all forms of tau similarly. Despite its reputation as an “intrinsically disordered” protein, tau is known to exist in a global conformation and contains regions of important secondary structure (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>; <Mukrasch et al., 2009>). PAD exposure is heavily dependent upon tau conformation (<Jeganathan et al., 2008>; <Kanaan et al., 2011>). In native-state biochemical assays, both TNT1 and TNT2 show remarkable selectivity and strong reactivity with pathological tau (e.g., aggregated recombinant protein and tau from Alzheimer’s disease brains), but not normal tau (e.g., recombinant monomers or tau from control brains). Importantly, the R1 antibody used for detection in these assays is a polyclonal antibody with epitopes throughout the entire tau protein (<Berry et al., 2004>) suggesting that these N-terminal antibodies will not negatively affect R1 binding. Indeed, deletion of amino acids 2–18 did not eliminate R1 reactivity in western blots, and pre-labeling tau with N-terminal antibodies does not appreciably affect R1 binding in indirect ELISAs (unpublished observation). The dependence of conformation was apparent as TNT1 and TNT2 lose their selectivity for pathological tau in denaturing SDS-PAGE western blots. Additionally, these antibodies demonstrated very high affinity for monomeric recombinant tau in indirect ELISAs suggesting the protein undergoes denaturation upon binding to the polystyrene plate, which has been noted with other proteins (<Hollander and Katchalski-Katzir, 1986>; <Shields et al., 1991>). TNT2 appears to be more sensitive to these conformational changes as evidenced by its greater reactivity in the non-denaturing assays as well as its stronger labeling of tau pathology in human tissue.The uniqueness of the TNT1 and TNT2 reactivity profile is further highlighted by the lack of such selectivity for pathological tau with Tau12 and Tau13. These differences in antibody reactivity are directly related to slight differences in their respective epitopes within the extreme N-terminus of tau. This suggests that reactivity could depend on a secondary structure within this region that is typically obscured or not present in monomeric tau but is exposed or stabilized in pathological tau. Secondary structure in this region has not been experimentally demonstrated but an α-helix is predicted to exist from amino acids 7–12 (<Gamblin, 2005>). Larger conformational changes could leave this epitope exposed or affect stability of the α-helix, thereby greatly enhancing antibody reactivity. Interestingly, TNT1 and TNT2, in particular, are less effective in the denaturing conditions of a western blot, indicating that some protein structure may enhance reactivity. In contrast, inclusion of amino acids 13–21 in the epitope of Tau12 and Tau13 appears to drive the lack of distinction between normal and pathological tau, suggesting that these downstream amino acids are accessible in all forms of tau. The N-terminal antibodies in this study were also used to characterize PAD exposure and tau deposition in human post-mortem brain sections. Reactive neurons were categorized into previously established phenotypes based on the stage of tau inclusion formation within the cells (<Bancher et al., 1989>, <1991>; <Braak et al., 1994>). Previous observations showing that TNT1 appeared to precede AT8 (<Kanaan et al., 2011>), a phosphoepitope that appears early in pathology formation, suggested that PAD exposure occurred very early in pre-tangle neurons (<Braak et al., 1994>; <Garcia-Sierra et al., 2000>; <Kanaan et al., 2012>; <Luna-Munoz et al., 2007>). Here, we found that TNT1 and TNT2 appear in Braak I–II stages and do not colocalize with ThR in the diffuse, granular pre-tangle pathology conclusively demonstrating that PAD exposure is an early event. As noted previously, ThR fluorescence was largely absent until the Braak III–IV cases when more compact NFT tau inclusions form (<Mena et al., 1995>). Importantly, we show that group 1 and 2 neurons, primarily labeled by TNT1 and TNT2 in the early Braak stages, are present through the latest Braak stages in roughly the same numbers. This finding highlights the asynchronous and continual nature of PAD exposure and tau inclusion formation during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, our data suggest that early PAD exposure is one of the mechanisms behind soluble and oligomeric tau toxicity (<Kanaan et al., 2011>, <2012>; <Patterson et al., 2011a>, <2011b>).The TNT antibodies also label classic NFT-containing group 3 neurons in later Braak stages, which colocalize with ThR. Apparent ThR-positive ghost tangles (i.e., without nuclei (<Braak et al., 1994>)) are no longer labeled by TNT1 or TNT2, which confirms that PAD exposure is lost in the latest stages of NFT evolution. The disappearance of TNT labeling is not unexpected as the loss of the extreme N-terminus in compact NFTs and ghost tangles were previously reported in several studies (<Bondareff et al., 1994>; <Dickson et al., 1992>; <Endoh et al., 1993>; <Horowitz et al., 2004>). Proteolysis with caspase-6, a known mediator of tau degradation, particularly at the D13 site, may cause the loss of TNT antibody reactivity as it does Tau12 reactivity (<Guo et al., 2004>; <Horowitz et al., 2004>). N-terminal cleavage in mature NFTs could have important implications for tau toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease as degradation would include a loss of PAD. This could reduce aberrant PAD-induced PP1-GSK3β signaling and axonal transport defects, potentially leading to NFTs that are less toxic than oligomers and other pre-tangle forms of tau pathology. Loss of TNT reactivity also explains the differences when compared to PHF1, a well-known phosphoepitope in tau (pS396/pS404) (<Greenberg et al., 1992>; <Otvos et al., 1994>), known to persist in late-stage NFTs (<Augustinack et al., 2002>). The staining patterns were similar until Braak stages V–VI when PHF1 labeled many more group 3 and 4 cells (e.g. ghost tangles). These differences support the notion that modifications and epitopes are differentially changed during the evolution of tau pathology.Tau12 and Tau13 showed similar patterns of reactivity throughout the different Braak stages, but these antibodies also robustly labeled parenchymal tau. This staining pattern is consistent with labeling normal endogenous tau proteins (<Papasozomenos and Binder, 1987>) and is not surprising considering their inability to differentiate between normal and misfolded tau in biochemical assays. In contrast, TNT1 and, to an even greater degree, TNT2 displayed a very strong preference for pathological tau and little to no parenchymal tau staining. This is one of the most important distinctions between the TNT antibodies and the other N-terminal antibodies studied here. Again, this demonstrates that the PAD exposure phenotype is specific to pathological forms of tau and is dependent on effects within the TNT1 and TNT2 epitopes (i.e. amino acids 7–12) but not the Tau12 and Tau13 epitopes that are just slightly downstream.Finally, we performed co-immunofluorescence stains of TNT1 or TNT2 with Alz50 to determine how these N-terminal antibodies compare to an established marker of early pathological conformational changes (<Carmel et al., 1996>; <Hyman et al., 1988>)."
PMC4983528_7,"Extensive colocalization existed between the TNT antibodies and Alz50 in all Braak stages and all cellular phenotypes (i e., groups 1–3 cells). It is noteworthy that the epitopes of the TNT and Alz50 antibodies overlap and that the EC50 value of Alz50 in an indirect ELISA with recombinant tau (24.50 ng/ml, data not shown) is quite close to that of TNT1 and TNT2 in molarity (Alz50 has a higher molecular weight as an IgM while TNT1 and TNT2 are IgG1 antibodies). These data suggest that there is direct competition for binding sites and this could lead to underestimations of each form of tau with these dual label stains. Despite this limitation, the high level of colocalization suggests the conformations that give rise to PAD exposure and the discontinuous epitope of Alz50 occur simultaneously in tau pathology. Importantly, the involvement of additional regions of tau protein for reactivity of Alz50 (<Carmel et al., 1996>) and MC1 (<Jicha et al., 1997>) mitigate their usefulness as direct markers of PAD exposure. There has long been a link between tau misfolding and tau pathology. Recent evidence shows that disease-related modifications of tau cause abnormal exposure of PAD leading to axonal dysfunction and highlighting the importance of tau’s amino terminus. Here, through the use of N-terminal tau antibodies, we examine these changes as tau progresses from normal to a pathological form. We demonstrate that TNT1 and TNT2 are strong markers for PAD exposure in pathological forms of tau while other N-terminal antibodies like Tau12 and Tau13 are unable to differentiate between the two forms. The uniqueness of the TNT antibodies and their interaction with the pathological changes associated with these conformational changes are due to their specific epitopes (i.e. amino acids 7–12), as it is not replicated with N-terminal antibodies that bind to locations slightly downstream. Due to the conformation-dependent specificity of TNT1 and TNT2, we provide strong evidence that PAD exposure occurs early during pathological tau deposition in human brains but the epitope is lost in late neurofibrillary tangles or ghost tangles. Given the previously demonstrated link between PAD exposure and toxic disruptions in anterograde fast axonal transport, this provides a potential explanation for toxicity associated with earlier forms of pathological tau but not mature neurofibrillary tangles. The data support changes in the N-terminus as a key identifier of dysfunctional tau, a finding that may have important implications for tau toxicity and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. rhetorical Fig. 1 (A–E) The epitopes were mapped using scanning alanine mutant tau proteins in western blots. (A) TNT1 reactivity was eliminated upon mutating amino acids 7–12. Similarly, TNT2 reactivity was disrupted with mutation of amino acids 7–12, and TNT2 displayed less reactivity in general compared to the other antibodies in western blotting. The Tau12 epitope (previously mapped to 2–23 (<Horowitz et al., 2004>)) was discontinuous as mutating amino acids 8–9 and 13–21 had a strong impact on reactivity. Tau13 is a very high-affinity antibody (previously mapped to 9–18 (<Garcia-Sierra et al., 2003>)), and similar to Tau12, reactivity for Tau13 was affected by mutating amino acids 8–9, and 13–21. Notably, none of the alanine mutant constructs completely eliminated reactivity, but deletion of amino acids 2–18 completely eliminated reactivity as before (<Garcia-Sierra et al., 2003>). The R1 tau antibody, a rabbit polyclonal total tau antibody with epitopes throughout the protein (i.e., unaffected by mutant protein changes), was used to identify total levels of all protein constructs. (B–E) Signal intensity was quantified for (B) TNT1, (C) TNT2, (D) Tau12, and (E) Tau13 and normalized to R1 signal to confirm elimination/reduction in reactivity with each recombinant tau protein. (F) A schematic representing the specific epitopes for each antibody (TNT1 and TNT2: 7–12; Tau12 and Tau13: 8–9, 13–21) and showing sequence alignments between the first 24 amino acids of human tau. (G) N-terminal antibody-binding affinities for full-length recombinant tau in indirect ELISAs. The antibodies (ranging from 48.8 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml) were incubated with recombinant tau (100 ng/well) bound to a titer ELISA plate. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose–response curve and EC50 values were determined (vertical lines), indicating the antibody concentration at which half of the maximum signal is obtained. TNT1 (black circles) EC50 = 4.86 ng/ml, TNT2 (blue squares) EC50 = 9.21 ng/ml, Tau12 (red diamonds) EC50 = 3.27 ng/ml, Tau13 (green triangles) EC50 = 2.51 ng/ml. rhetorical Fig. 2 (A–D). The binding affinity of (A) TNT1, (B) TNT2, (C) Tau12, and (D) Tau13 for monomeric and aggregated recombinant tau samples (ranging from 12.2 pM to 200 nM) were measured using sandwich ELISAs (n = 3; mean ± SEM). (A) TNT1 showed reactivity with aggregated tau (black circles) starting at 3.125 nM (EC50 = 6.0 nM) but did not detect monomeric tau (red squares) until it reached 200 nM (EC50 = undetermined). (B) Similarly, TNT2 robustly reacted with aggregated tau starting at 0.781 nM (TNT2: EC50 = 2.6 nM) but did not detect monomeric tau until it reached 200 nM (EC50 = undetermined). (C) Tau12 displayed a slight preference for aggregated tau (EC50 = 6.9 nM) over monomeric tau (EC50 = 2.5 nM). (D) Tau13 recognized monomeric (EC50 = 1.9 nM) and aggregated (EC50 = 1.1 nM) tau similarly at all concentrations. (E) The same monomer and aggregated tau samples were denatured and run on SDS-PAGE/western blots to determine whether the aggregated tau-selective reactivity was conformation-dependent. Representative blots with TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, and Tau13 demonstrating equal reactivity to the denatured monomeric and aggregated samples (top). Equivalent amounts of tau were confirmed with R1, a pan-tau antibody (bottom). (F) The signal intensities associated with each antibody’s reactivity to monomeric (red squares) and aggregated (black circles) tau samples were quantified and normalized to the R1 values. This quantitation showed equal reactivity in western blots with TNT1: p = 0.593, t(2) = 0.630; TNT2: p = 0.550, t(2) = 0.713; Tau12: p = 0.368, t(2) = 1.153; Tau13: p = 0.742, t(2) = 0.378 (compared with paired t-tests). rhetorical Fig. 3 TNT1 and TNT2 display conformation-dependent recognition of PAD-exposed tau in Alzheimer’s disease, which is not present in non-demented controls. (A) Soluble protein fractions from human frontal cortex lysates of control and AD brains were used in sandwich ELISAs using TNT1, TNT2, Tau12, Tau13, or PHF1 as the capture antibody. TNT1, TNT2, and PHF1 all detected significantly more tau in AD lysates (black squares) than in control lysates (red circles) (n = 6; mean ± SEM; *p < 0.05, unpaired t-test, TNT1: t(10) = 4.843, p = 0.0007; TNT2: t(10) = 7.303; p < 0.0001; Tau12: t(10) = 1.228; p = 0.2475; Tau13: t(10) = 0.9758; p = 0.3522; PHF1: (t(10) = 2.504; p = 0.0312)). (B) Sandwich ELISAs were also carried out with sarkosyl-insoluble protein fractions from human frontal cortex lysates of control and AD brains. Significantly more tau was detected in the sarkosyl-insoluble protein fractions from AD lysates than the control lysates with all antibodies (n = 5 for control and n = 6 AD; mean ± SEM; *p < 0.05, unpaired t-test, TNT1: (t(9) = 2.923; p = 0.0169), TNT2: (t(9) = 4.301; p = 0.002), Tau12: (t(9) = 3.228; p = 0.0103), Tau13: (t(9) = 2.398; p = 0.04) and PHF1: (t(9) = 2.264; p = 0.0499)). (C) The soluble fractions for control and AD brains were run under denaturing conditions in western blots. Samples were loaded at 60 μg total protein/lane for TNT1 and TNT2 and 20 μg total protein/lane for Tau12 and Tau13. GAPDH was used as a loading control to confirm equal loading and R1, a pan-tau antibody, was used to determine the total amounts of tau in the samples. Notably, TNT1 and TNT2 did not work as well as Tau12 or Tau13 in western blot assays. (D) Tau signal intensities from the control and AD western blots were quantified and normalized to the GAPDH signal."

Conformational changes involving the amino terminus of the tau protein are among the earliest alterations associated with tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. This region of tau contains a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) that is aberrantly exposed in pathological forms of the protein, an event that is associated with disruptions in anterograde fast axonal transport. We utilized four antibodies that recognize the amino terminus of tau, TNT1, TNT2 (a novel antibody), Tau12, and Tau13, to further study this important region."
PMC4983528_9,"Using scanning alanine mutations in recombinant tau proteins, we refined the epitopes of each antibody  We examined the antibodies’ relative abilities to specifically label pathological tau in non-denaturing and denaturing assays to gain insight into some of the mechanistic details of PAD exposure. We then determined the pattern of tau pathology labeled by each antibody in human hippocampal sections at various disease stages in order to characterize PAD exposure in the context of disease progression. The characteristics of reactivity for the antibodies fell into two groups. TNT1 and TNT2 recognized epitopes within amino acids 7–12 and specifically identified recombinant tau aggregates and pathological tau from Alzheimer’s disease brains in a conformation-dependent manner. These antibodies labeled early pre-tangle pathology from neurons in early Braak stages and colocalized with thiazine red, a marker of fibrillar pathology, in classic neurofibrillary tangles. However, late tangles were negative for TNT1 and TNT2 indicating a loss of the epitope in later stages of tangle evolution. In contrast, Tau12 and Tau13 both identified discontinuous epitopes in the amino terminus and were unable to differentiate between normal and pathological tau in biochemical and tissue immunohistological assays. Despite the close proximity of these epitopes, the antibodies demonstrated remarkably different abilities to identify pathological changes in tau indicating that detection of conformational alterations involving PAD exposure is not achieved by all N-terminal tau antibodies and that a relatively discrete region of the N-terminus (i.e., amino acids 7–12, the TNT1 and TNT2 epitope) is central to the differences between normal and pathological tau. The appearance of PAD in early tau pathology and its disappearance in late-stage tangles suggest that toxic forms of tau are associated with the earliest forms of tau deposits. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the TNT antibodies are useful markers for early conformational display of PAD and provide information regarding conformational changes that have potential implications in the toxic mechanisms of tau pathology. ."
PMC2596940_0,"The proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce Aβ peptides is thought to play an important role in the mechanism of Alzheimer’s Disease. Here we show that lysines 587 and 595 of APP, which are immediately adjacent to the site of β-secretase cleavage, are covalently modified by SUMO proteins in vivo. Sumoylation of these lysine residues is associated with decreased levels of Aβ aggregates. Further, overexpression of the SUMO E2 enzyme ubc9 along with SUMO-1 results in decreased levels of Aβ aggregates in cells transfected with the familial Alzheimer’s disease-associated V642F mutant APP, indicating the potential of up-regulating activity of the cellular sumoylation machinery as an approach against Alzheimer’s Disease.

Alzheimer’s Disease is a debilitating condition that impairs cognitive function and is the most common aging-related human neurodegenerative disease [<1>–<3>]. It is widely believed that amyloid-β (Aβ) protein produced by processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the amyloidogenic proteolytic pathway is a primary causative factor in this disease.Covalent attachment of Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) proteins to lysine residues in target proteins, or sumoylation, is an important regulator of protein functional properties [<4>–<6>]. SUMO proteins are covalently attached to target lysine residues by the SUMO E2 enzyme, ubc9, and these modified lysines are typically found within the consensus sequence ΨKXE/D (Ψ represents hydrophobic amino acids) [<7>–<10>]. Cells express three major SUMO paralogs, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, with SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 being much more similar to each other than to SUMO-1 [<4>–<6>].Using an in vitro translation expression cloning strategy, in which candidate sumoylation substrate proteins were identified by assaying successive subdivisions of cDNA pools with in vitro sumoylation reactions, a previous study identified APP as a potential sumoylation substrate [<11>]. The goals of the experiments in this present study were to determine whether any lysine residue(s) within APP are sumoylated in the protein as expressed in cells, and if so, what role this modification plays in modulating the functional properties of this protein, including its proteolytic processing. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Cellgro) with 10% FBS and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, 100x) in 5% CO2. Transfection was performed using Effectene reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The 6xHis-APP plasmid was constructed from pCITE-4a (+)-APP695 (Dr. Iliya Lefterov). Mutagenesis PCR was performed to generate pCITE-APP K587R, K595R, K587/595R, and V642F mutants (QuikChange method, Stratagene). The pCITE-APP wildtype and mutants were then digested with BamHI and NotI, and the APP fragments ligated into pAG3-His-APPΔNL plasmid [<12>] which was also digested with BamHI and NotI, thereby swapping the Aβ-containing and flanking regions of the plasmids (thus, Swedish mutation is not present in final 6xHis-APP constructs). HA-SUMO-1 and HA-SUMO-2 were expressed using pcDNA3-HA-SUMO-1 and pcDNA3-HA-SUMO-2 plasmids (Dr. Kim Orth), and ubc9 expressed using a pcDNA3-ubc9 construct (Dr. Moshe Sadofsky). HeLa cells were transfected with 6xHis-APP wildtype or mutant APP (V642F, K587R, K595R, or K587,595R) constructs along with HA-SUMO-1 or HA-SUMO-2 expression plasmids. At 48 hours after transfection, the cells were collected and re-suspended in 500µl pQE buffer (20mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 300mM NaCl, 2mM β-mercaptoethanol), with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1mM PMSF, and 20mM N-ethylmaleimide added fresh. Cell lysis was performed by sonication 3 times at 20 kHz, followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 10 minutes, 80µl of the cell lysate was taken for analysis of Aβ and APP protein levels (20µl for each). 150µl of 50% Ni-NTA agarose slurry (Qiagen) was washed 3 times with PBS and then added to the cell lysate. After incubation at 4°C for 1hr, beads were washed sequentially with pQE buffers containing 5mM, 25mM, and 50mM imidazole (each wash twice)."
PMC2596940_1,"Then, 50µl pQE buffer with 250mM imidazole was added to the beads and protein eluted by shaking at RT for 30 min  The eluate was analyzed by anti-HA Western blot as described below. Antibodies used were: anti-Aβ(<1>–<17>) mouse antibody (Signet Labs), anti-APP C-terminal rabbit antibody (Calbiochem), anti-HA mouse antibody (gift of Dr. Doug Andres), anti-ubc9 and anti-lamin A mouse antibodies (both from BD Transduction Labs), and anti-calnexin rabbit antibody (Calbiochem). This was performed as previously described [<13>] using 1:100 dilutions of the anti-calnexin and anti-ubc9 antibodies. HeLa cells were collected, and the cell pellets re-suspended in 500 µl Buffer A (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 250 mM sucrose) with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) added fresh. The cells were disrupted by dounce homogenization (30 strokes), followed by incubation on ice for 20 minutes. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 1,000g, 4°C for 10 minutes to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000×g, 4°C for 10 minutes to pellet mitochondria and intact Golgi. After this centrifugation, the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000×g, 4°C for 10 minutes to pellet large dense ER vesicles. The nuclei fraction and membrane fraction containing large dense vesicles were washed with Buffer A, and re-suspended in 10 pellet volumes of RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP-40, 0.2% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail). The suspension was then passed through a 23 gauge needle 20 times, and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 10 min., the supernatant was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies that detect ubc9, lamin A, and calnexin. Sealed, ER-enriched, myelin-depleted calf brain microsomes were isolated as previously described [<14>], except that 10mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) was used instead of 0.1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The intactness of these calf-brain microsomal vesicles was determined by measuring the latency of the processing, deoxynojirimycin-sensitive glucosidase I/II activities using [3H]Glc1–3 Man9GlcNAc2 as substrate in the presence and absence of Triton X-100 (2mg/ml) as previously described [<15>]. The calf-brain microsomal vesicles were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with trypsin (trypsin:total protein (w/w) = 1:20) in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 (adapted from [<15>]), and then subjected to Western blot assay using anti-ubc9 antibodies. As shown in <Fig. 1A>, analysis of the amino acid sequence of APP revealed two matches to the sumoylation consensus sequence ΨKXE/D surrounding lysines 587 and 595 of this protein (numbered according to the APP695 isoform). These two lysine residues are immediately N-terminal to the β–secretase cleavage site. To test whether APP is modified by SUMO-1 or SUMO-2, and if so, whether the modification occurs at lysines 587 and/or 595, HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding 6xHis-fusion constructs of wildtype APP and APP in which lysines 587 or 595, or both, were changed to non-sumoylatable arginines (K587R, K595R, and K587R/K595R), along with constructs encoding HA-SUMO-1 or HA-SUMO-2. The 6xHis tag in these APP constructs is located immediately C-terminal to the signal peptide, thereby allowing this 6xHis motif to remain after signal peptide cleavage and be used to affinity purify the transfected APP proteins using Ni-NTA beads [<12>]. Thus, extracts of the transfected cells were subjected to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography to pull down the transfected 6xHis-tagged wildtype and lysine mutant APP proteins, followed by anti-HA Western blot assay to detect potential sumoylated forms of the proteins. The results suggest that the wildtype APP protein is sumoylated by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 as evidenced by the detection of a number of distinct bands by the anti-HA antibody (<Fig. 1B, top panels>) that are significantly larger than the APP protein detected by an antibody that detects full-length APP (<Figure 1B, bottom panels>). The relatively large sizes of some of the sumoylated APP forms may reflect the presence of SUMO chains on the proteins [<16>], while the most rapidly migrating bands could possibly represent SUMO-modified proteolytic fragments of APP. The results also indicate that the intensity of sumoylated bands is slightly decreased for both the K587R and K595R APP mutants compared to wildtype APP, and completely abolished in the K587R/K595R double mutant APP protein. These results suggest that lysines 587 and 595 of APP are sites of sumoylation.As shown above in <Fig. 1A>, the lysine 587 and 595 sumoylation sites in APP are only 1 and 9 residues, respectively, away from the β–secretase cleavage site. Based on this proximity, we hypothesized that sumoylation at these lysine residues could regulate cleavage at this site, thereby potentially modulating levels of Aβ. To test this hypothesis, we used an antibody against the Aβ peptide to perform Western blot assays of extracts of cells transfected with the wildtype or lysine mutant (both single and double mutants) APP constructs and HA-SUMO-1/HA-SUMO-2 constructs in order to examine levels of Aβ aggregates in the extracts [<17>–<19>]. The results indicate that, compared to the extracts of cells transfected with the wildtype APP protein, extracts of cells expressing the K587R and K595R single sumoylation site mutant APP constructs both exhibit higher levels of Aβ aggregates, which are further increased in those of cells expressing the K587R/K595R double mutant APP construct (<Fig. 1B, middle panels>). These results suggest that sumoylation of APP at lysines 587 and 595 acts to negatively regulate levels of Aβ aggregates.Next, to test whether endogenous APP in brain is sumoylated, we subjected extracts of mouse brain to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the C-terminal region of APP, followed by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates using anti-SUMO-1 or anti-SUMO-2 antibodies. The results, shown in <Fig. 2>, indicate that brain APP is modified by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2.Based on the results in <Fig. 1> above indicating that blocking sumoylation of APP results in elevated levels of Aβ peptide aggregates, we hypothesized that up-regulating cellular sumoylation could represent a means for reducing Aβ levels. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of up-regulating expression of ubc9, the SUMO E2 enzyme, on levels of Aβ aggregates in cells transfected with an APP construct containing the familial Alzheimer’s disease-associated V642F mutation that results in elevated levels of Aβ aggregates [<20>,<21>]. Thus, in this experiment cells were transfected with a 6xHis-APP (V642F) construct and the HA-SUMO-1 construct, and either empty pcDNA3 plasmid or a pcDNA3 construct that expresses ubc9, the SUMO E2 enzyme. As in the experiments described in <Fig. 1> above, the 6-His-APP (V642F) protein was isolated from extracts of the transfected cells using Ni-NTA affinity beads and then analyzed by anti-HA Western blot to detect sumoylated forms of this protein. The results indicate that the amount of sumoylation of this APP protein is higher in the ubc9-overexpressing cells (<Fig. 3A>), and that this is associated with decreased amounts of Aβ aggregates in extracts of these cells (<Fig. 3C>).Sumoylation of protein domains that are exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other compartments of the secretory pathway has not been previously reported. However, the results described above indicating the SUMO modification of APP suggested that sumoylation may be occurring within one or more of these membrane-bound compartments. To test the feasibility of this hypothesis, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of cells using antibodies against the SUMO E2 enzyme, ubc9, as well as the ER protein calnexin. The results indicate that a portion of the ubc9 staining in cells overlaps that of calnexin (<Fig. 4A and 4B>), suggesting that this sub-population of the SUMO E2 enzyme colocalizes with the ER."
PMC2596940_2,"The ubc9 staining pattern we observed is consistent with the results of previous studies that examined the subcellular localization of ubc9, which showed that, in addition to a nuclear-localized population, some of the ubc9 staining is found outside the nucleus in a pattern reminiscent of ER localization [<9>,<22>,<23>] As an independent approach for testing the apparent co-localization of the SUMO E2 enzyme with the ER, Western blot analysis was performed on nuclear vs. ER-enriched vesicle fractions using antibodies against ubc9 as well as antibodies against lamin A and calnexin as positive controls for the nuclear and ER fractions, respectively. The results indicate that a portion of the cellular ubc9 is detected in the ER vesicle fraction, both uncharged ubc9 and ubc9 that is covalently charged with SUMO, the form of the protein ready to transfer the SUMO group to other proteins (<Fig. 4C>). The appearance of less ubc9 protein in the ER vesicle fraction vs. the nuclear fraction may be due to the several subsequent differential centrifugation steps required to obtain the ER vesicles, resulting in lower relative yields. The results in <Figure 4C> support the hypothesis that the SUMO E2 enzyme is associated with the ER.For ubc9 to be able to sumoylate APP, it would presumably have to be present within the lumenal compartment of the secretory pathway. To test this hypothesis we subjected sealed calf brain microsomes enriched in rough endoplasmic reticulum to trypsin digestion in the absence or presence of Triton X-100, with the detergent functioning to unseal the vesicles to expose their contents to the protease. The results reveal that in the absence of Triton X-100 no degradation of ubc9 is observed, but that treatment of the vesicles with this detergent is associated with digestion of the ubc9 protein (<Fig. 4D>). These results suggest that the SUMO E2 enzyme is found within the lumen of these vesicles. The results also indicate that both uncharged ubc9, as well as a substantial amount of active SUMO-charged ubc9, are found within this compartment. The results in this paper indicate that lysines 587 and 595 of the APP protein are covalently modified by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2, and that this modification negatively regulates levels of Aβ aggregates. The mechanism by which sumoylation at lysines 587 and 595 leads to decreased Aβ aggregate levels is unknown, but the close proximity of the sumoylation sites to the site of β-secretase cleavage suggests the possibility that the presence of the 97 amino acid SUMO protein attached at these sites might sterically block binding of this protease to APP.One of the lysine residues identified as a sumoylation site by this study, lysine 595, is the same lysine that is mutated to asparagine in the previously characterized Swedish (KM-to-NL) APP mutant [<24>]. This suggests the possibility that inability to be sumoylated at this lysine could contribute, at least to some extent, to the increased Aβ production exhibited by the Swedish APP mutant.Two previous studies obtained data indicating that overexpression of SUMO proteins affects the levels of Aβ [<25>,<26>]. However, these studies did not examine whether APP was sumoylated, and in addition the meaning of these results is not clear as the two studies observed opposite effects of SUMO protein overexpression on Aβ levels. In any event, it appears these effects of SUMO overexpression on Aβ are likely mediated by a mechanism different from that of direct APP sumoylation examined in our study as they were observed even when non-conjugatable SUMO proteins were expressed [<26>].The data presented in this paper also indicate that the SUMO E2 enzyme ubc9 is present within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, providing an explanation for how lysines 587 and 595 of APP can be sumoylated, and suggesting that other proteins entering the endoplasmic reticulum may also be targets of sumoylation. This result extends the sub-cellular reach of sumoylation to include the regulation of proteins in the secretory pathway. The mechanism by which ubc9 enters this compartment is unclear, as it does not appear to contain any obvious signal sequence. However, ubc9 is identified as a candidate non-classical secretory pathway protein by the prediction program SecretomeP [<27>]. Thus, one possibility is that ubc9 enters some membrane-bound compartment in the cell which then subsequently merges with the ER.Finally, the results indicating that elevation of ubc9 expression reduces levels of Aβ aggregates in cells expressing APP V642F suggest that approaches that up-regulate cellular sumoylation have potential as new therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer’s disease. Future studies exploring this and other questions should reveal new information about APP sumoylation and its potential medical applications. The proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce Aβ peptides is thought to play an important role in the mechanism of Alzheimer’s Disease. Here we show that lysines 587 and 595 of APP, which are immediately adjacent to the site of β-secretase cleavage, are covalently modified by SUMO proteins in vivo. Sumoylation of these lysine residues is associated with decreased levels of Aβ aggregates. Further, overexpression of the SUMO E2 enzyme ubc9 along with SUMO-1 results in decreased levels of Aβ aggregates in cells transfected with the familial Alzheimer’s disease-associated V642F mutant APP, indicating the potential of up-regulating activity of the cellular sumoylation machinery as an approach against Alzheimer’s Disease. The results also provide the first demonstration that the SUMO E2 enzyme (ubc9) is present within the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating how APP, and perhaps other proteins that enter this compartment, can be sumoylated. ."
