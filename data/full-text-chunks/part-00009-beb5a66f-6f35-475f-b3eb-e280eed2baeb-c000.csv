PMC5715613_0,"The microtubule-associated protein Tau plays a role in neurodegeneration as well as neurogenesis. Previous work has shown that the expression of the pro-aggregant mutant Tau repeat domain causes strong aggregation and pronounced neuronal loss in the hippocampus whereas the anti-aggregant form has no deleterious effects. These two proteins differ mainly in their propensity to form ß structure and hence to aggregate. To elucidate the basis of these contrasting effects, we analyzed organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) from transgenic mice expressing the repeat domain (RD) of Tau with the anti-aggregant mutation (TauRDΔKPP) and compared them with slices containing pro-aggregant TauRDΔK. Transgene expression in the hippocampus was monitored via a sensitive bioluminescence reporter gene assay (luciferase). The expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP leads to a larger volume of the hippocampus at a young age due to enhanced neurogenesis, resulting in an increase in neuronal number. There were no signs of activation of microglia and astrocytes, indicating the absence of an inflammatory reaction. Investigation of signaling pathways showed that Wnt-5a was strongly decreased whereas Wnt3 was increased. A pronounced increase in hippocampal stem cell proliferation (seen by BrdU) was observed as early as P8, in the CA regions where neurogenesis is normally not observed. The increase in neurons persisted up to 16 months of age. The data suggest that the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP enhances hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, without an inflammatory reaction. This study points to a role of tau in brain development and neurogenesis, in contrast to its detrimental role in neurodegeneration at later age.

DZNE, MPG, Tau Consortium Not applicable Tau plays an important role in brain development and neurogenesis. The 3-repeat fetal isoform of Tau is expressed in newborn granule cells [<26>], whereas 4-repeat adult Tau isoforms are involved in promoting neuronal differentiation, neurite and axonal outgrowth [<14>, <67>]. The phosphorylation of Tau is developmentally regulated, as it is higher in the fetal neurons and decreases with their maturation [<10>]. In many neurodegenerative diseases Tau forms neurofibrillary tangles, even though it is a highly soluble natively unfolded protein [<81>]. The aggregation of Tau is based on its repeat domain that harbors two hexapeptide motifs with a propensity for β-structure which is responsible for Tau aggregation and pathology [<80>]. Based on the structural analysis and cell models, our laboratory generated transgenic mouse models to study the influence of Tau aggregation on pathology. One of the models expresses the 4R-repeat domain, combined with the aggregation-promoting gene mutation ∆K280 observed in cases of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer Disease (AD) [<57>, <65>]. These mice showed extensive Tau missorting, aggregation, astrogliosis, loss of synapses, and neurodegeneration [<56>, <72>]. By contrast, an \anti-aggregant\"" mouse line was generated", expressing the 4R tau repeat domain with the same ∆K280 mutation but with two additional proline mutations to neutralize the ß-sheet formation. In this line the aggregation is suppressed, and the mice do not show cognitive deficits even at advanced age. These findings supported the view that pathological effects of Tau depend on its ability to aggregate.Another initial assumption was that the anti-aggregant Tau did not perturb the normal functions of Tau, particularly since the expression of the Tau repeat domain was low and therefore had only minimal effects on microtubule stability. However, in order to test this, we investigated this mouse line in more detail using organotypic hippocampal slices. This revealed the surprising result that anti-aggregant Tau is not simply a passive bystander, but actively promotes neurogenesis. This is reminiscent of other reports showing that neurogenesis plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative Tauopathies like AD, PD, or FTD [<48>, <73>, <82>, <83>]. Pathological forms of Tau cause defects in neurogenesis and neural plasticity that precede the aggregation of Tau and Aß [<22>, <29>, <44>]. A decline in neurogenesis correlates with an increased release of CSF tau [<41>], an early marker for neurodegeneration. Regenerative strategies to enhance the endogenous production of the neuronal progenitor cells from the NSCs [<15>], induced by drugs [<8>, <52>], physical exercise [<16>, <76>, <77>] or environmental enrichment [<39>, <40>] have been proposed as therapeutic approaches. Conversely, this implies that anti-aggregant forms of Tau could protect against neurodegeneration by boosting neurogenesis, as reported here. Transgenic mice expressing the human Tau four-repeat domain with the aggregation-promoting FDTP-17 mutation ∆K280 (TauRD∆K, 129 residues, M-Q244-E372 without K280) or with the additional anti-aggregant Ile277Pro and Ile208Pro mutations (TauRD∆KPP) and reporter gene firefly luciferase under control of a Tet-operon response element (tetO) [<56>], were crossed with CaMKIIα-tTA mice (Mayford et al, 1996) to generate a regulatable Tet-off system. Animals were housed and tested according to standards of the German Animal Welfare Act. Since the mouse lines were generated using a bidirectional promoter to express both the Tau construct (pro-aggregant TauRD∆K or anti-aggregant TauRD∆KPP) and the reporter protein firefly luciferase, its enzymatic activity can be used to quantify the expression levels and regional distribution (Contag, 2007). Photon emission was detected with a luminometer (IVIS Spectrum) at 560-660 nm (Caliper Life Sciences, Germany) after incubation of cultures with 470 μM of the luciferase substrate D-luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences, Germany) and measured after 10,15,20, 25 and 30 days in culture.Hippocampal organotypic slice cultures were prepared following Stoppini et al. [<69>], with modifications. Briefly, 8-10 days old mice were decapitated, brains were rapidly removed and hippocampi dissected at 4°C. A McIIwain tissue chopper (Gabler, Bad Schwabach; Germany) was used to prepare 400 μm thick transverse slices which were transferred to semi-porous cell culture inserts (Millipore, Bedford, MA, 0.4 μm). Inserts containing 6-8 slices were placed in six well culture trays containing 1 ml of culture media (50% MEM, 25% HBSS, penicillin/streptomycin (all from PAA, Austria), 25% horse serum, 4.5 mg/ml glucose (Sigma, Germany), pH 7.4). The culture medium was changed on the first day after preparation and afterwards every 3rd day. Slices were kept in culture for 3 - 4 weeks. Suppression of the human Tau transgene was achieved by adding doxycycline (Sigma, Germany) to the culture media (final concentration 2 μg/ml). During treatment, doxycycline was refreshed every 3rd day together with full medium change. Slices were cultured under the normal culturing conditions until DIV15. From DIV15 onwards, 50μM of BrdU was dissolved in the normal slice culture media and the slices were cultured until DIV30. BrdU containing culture media was refreshed during every culture media change. At DIV30, the slices were fixed and used for further immunohistochemical analysis. To estimate protein expression, cultured hippocampal slices (6–8, prepared and pooled from the same animal) were homogenized in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl," pH 7."""

The membrane was incubated in 5% non-fat milk in TBS-Tween for 1 h at RT, washed with TBS-Tween the next day and incubated overnight in primary antibody solution at 4°C. The membrane was washed with TBS-Tween and incubated with the secondary antibody (Dako, Germany) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 h at RT. The membrane was developed by ECL Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE Healthcare, USA) and analyzed by densitometry (LAS 3000; AIDA software; Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The following antibodies were used: pan Tau antibody (K9JA) (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) (1:5000); anti-GFAP antibody (Cell signaling technology) (1:1000), anti-Wnt3 antibody (GenTex) (1:500); anti-Wnt5a antibody (Abcam) (1:500), total-GSK3ß (Sigma, Germany) (1:1000), pGSK3ß(Y216) (Sigma, Germany) (1:1000) anti-ß actin (Sigma, Germany) (1:10.000) and secondary antibodies, HRP-anti-rabbit and HRP-anti-mouse (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Slice cultures were left attached on the Millicell membrane and stained as free-floating sections in 6-well plates. Cultures were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (PAA, Austria) for 2 h at 4°C. After washing with cold PBS, slices were permeabilized by 0.4% TritonX-100/PBS for 90 min at RT. Slices were then blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h and afterwards incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS for 2-3 days at 4°C. After washing with PBS, slices were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 days at 4°C. After washing, slices were mounted with Permafluor mounting solution (Beckman Coulter, Paris, France), cover-slipped and dried before imaging. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) (1:1000), pan-Tau antibody K9JA (Dako, Hamburg, Germany, Nr. A0024 (1:1000)); anti-Iba1 antibody (Wako Chemicals, Germany) (1:1000); anti-GFAP antibody (Cell signaling technology) (1:1000), anti-BrdU (GenTex) (1:1000), DCX (Cell Signalling) (1:500) and Ki67 (Abcam) (1:500). All fluorescent (goat anti-rabbit/mouse cyanine 2, 3 and 5)-labeled secondary antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany) (1:1000). Pups at post-natal day 8, from both the control and the anti-aggregant groups were taken. Their body weight and gender was noted. BrdU (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and 50mg/kg body weight was injected into each animal carefully. The pups were kept alive for 2 hours after the BrdU injection then killed by cervical decapitation and their brains removed for further immunohistochemical analysis. Post-natal brain from P8 animals and brain of the 2 month old animals were removed by cervical decapitation and immediately fixed in 4%PFA solution for over 2 days at 4°C. The brain was then cut into 40μm thick coronal free floating sections with the help of a vibratome at RT. For immunofluorescence staining the sections were then collected in the preservation solution (0.1M PBS+ 30% Sucrose) until further use. The sections were first permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 followed by the antigen retrieval step, where the free floating sections were heated in pre-heated sodium citrate buffer at 80°C for 30 min. The sections were then kept in the same sodium citrate buffer until the temperature of the buffer cools down to RT, washed with PBS and blocked with 5% horse serum for a minimum of 2 hours. Primary antibodies were then diluted in PBS and the free floating sections were incubated overnight at 4°C followed by the secondary antibody either overnight or for a minimum of 2 hours. Images were acquired with an Olympus laser scanning microscope FV1000 (Olympus, Tokyo), equipped with confocal laser scanning unit, argon (Ar; 488 nm) and helium/neon (He/Ne 543 nm and 633 nm). For 2 or 3 channel imaging, images were acquired via sequential scanning. Image stacks were collected for the whole hippocampus at lower magnification and for all hippocampal subfields at higher magnifications. Digital zoom was used for fluorescent dye tracing of single neurons and spines. Maximum projection images were generated from resulting Z stacks using ImageJ software (NIH). Volume estimation using the Cavalieri principle on transgenic and control mice was performed with stereo investigator software (MBF Biosciences) driving a motorized stage. Cavalieri analysis was performed with the investigator blind to genotype. To determine the number of neurons in the different areas of the hippocampus, unbiased counting was performed with stereo investigator software. The brains were dissected and fixed immediately with 4%PFA for 72 hours, then changes to 30% sucrose in PBS. Then the brains were cut into 40μm thick free-floating sections. Every 8th section of the hippocampus was immunostained with NeuN and then volume analysis was done on these sections. The volume of the hippocampus thus obtained is quoted as the apparent volume, without correction for shrinkage during brain slice preparation process. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. All graphs were created with GraphPad Prism 7. Different statistical analyses were performed as appropriate, and indicated in the figure legends. Briefly, experimental data were analyzed either by Student's t-test (when only one parameter was analyzed). Data are shown as mean ± SEM. p values are as follows: *p < 0.05, **< 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 ***p<0.001. Figure <1a> depicts the human Tau variants used in generating the transgenic mouse lines. They are expressed together with a luciferase reporter on the same plasmid under control of a bidirectional transactivator (tTA)-responsive promoter, combined with forebrain-specific expression of tTA under the CaMKIIα promoter. In this tet-off system, gene expression in the forebrain can be switched off or on, respectively, by addition or removal of doxycycline, both in mice and organotypic slices [<33>, <55>]. This allows one to monitor the expression of Tau via the bioluminescence of luciferin in living mice and in slices, using the IVIS in-vivo imaging system. rhetorical Fig. 1 Expression level of the exogenous human anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRD∆K. a The anti-aggregant and pro-aggregant construct is based on the human Tau 4-repeat domain carrying the FTDP-17 mutation ΔK280 near the beginning of R2. The four repeats in the C-terminal half of Tau are highlighted in green (R1-R4). The two hexapeptide motifs at the beginning of R2 and R3 are capable of promoting aggregation by inducing ß-structure. The ΔK280 mutation promotes aggregation, and the two proline mutations inhibit it. b Luciferase activity within the brains of pups: Control (top row), expressing anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP (middle row) or pro-aggregant TauRDΔK (bottom row) at post-natal day 8 (P8), as determined by bioluminescence (photons/sec). The control brain does not show any luciferase signal, the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP brain shows an intense luciferase signal (middle and right panel), ranging from 2 - 6x 107 photons per second (blue to red, see heat scale on right), predominantly in the frontal part of the brain. A similar expression pattern is seen in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK brain at P8. c Luciferase activity monitored in slices of anti-aggregant mice from DIV10 to DIV30. The signal remains roughly constant from DIV10 to DIV20 and then declines down to ~40% at DIV25-30 (because of the aging process in the slice cultures).

This allows one to monitor the expression of Tau via the bioluminescence of luciferin in living mice and in slices, using the IVIS in-vivo imaging system. P8 animals were used for the preparation of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs), and the expression level of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK pups at P8 was measured by bioluminescence (Fig. <1b>). The brains from the transgenic pups showed enhanced bioluminescence in the range of 2.0-6.0x 107 photons/second (after application of 5μl of 2μM luciferin on the dissected brain). The expression was high in the forebrain region (as expected for the CaMKIIα promoter, Fig. <1b>, red color). OHSCs were cultured under optimal conditions up to 30 days in vitro (DIV30).For analyzing the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK in slice cultures, we directly applied luciferin into the culture media and the bioluminescence was measured by IVIS over the whole culturing period. In the anti-aggregant slices the bioluminescence signal remains roughly constant from DIV10 until DIV20, then decreases down to ~40% of the value at DIV25 (Fig. <1c>). In the pro-aggregant slices the expression was similar to the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP at DIV10-15, but then declines rapidly (Fig. <1d>). This may be due to the strong Tau pathology of the toxic pro-aggregant TauRDΔK leading to Tau aggregation, loss of synapses and loss of neurons. A similar decrease of the bioluminescence signal is observed in live animals (both anti-aggregant and pro-aggregant mice), except that it takes place on a ~5-fold longer time scale, i.e. high expression during the first two post-natal months [<32>]. OHSCs at DIV30 were fixed and immunostained for NeuN, a marker for mature neurons. Microscopic analysis revealed a remarkable overall increase (30%) in the size of the hippocampus of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs, compared to controls and the age-matched pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices (Fig. <2a>). To verify whether this was due to an increase in neuronal number, individual regions of the hippocampus were imaged (Fig. <2b>) and neuronal numbers counted manually using ImageJ software. This revealed an impressive increase in mature neurons in all regions of the hippocampus (47% in CA1; 69% in CA3 and 81% in DG) in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices compared to age-matched controls (Fig. <2c>, bars 2, 5 and 8). By contrast, the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed a pronounced reduction in neuronal numbers, particularly in the CA1 (-44%), CA3 (-33%) and DG (-22%) regions compared to controls (Fig. <2c>, bars 3, 6 and 9). Thus, pro-aggregant TauRDΔK causes neurodegeneration, whereas anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP leads to neurogenesis, even in regions outside the DG. rhetorical Fig. 2 Increased number of neurons in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP organotypic hippocampal slice culture. a OHSCs were prepared from control, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK pups aged P8.

By contrast, the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed a pronounced reduction in neuronal numbers, particularly in the CA1 (-44%), CA3 (-33%) and DG (-22%) regions compared to controls (Fig. <2c>, bars 3, 6 and 9). Thus, pro-aggregant TauRDΔK causes neurodegeneration, whereas anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP leads to neurogenesis, even in regions outside the DG. To study the effect of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK on glial cells, we investigated the status of microglial morphology and number in the slice cultures. OHSCs at DIV30 were immunostained for neurons (marker NeuN, Fig. <3a>; red) and for microglia (marker Iba1; Fig. <3a>; green). The ramified/active microglia (with many (6-7) and longer processes, typically 5-10 μm) and rounded/reactive microglia (fewer (2-3) and shorter processes ≤ 5μm) are clearly distinguishable in the slice cultures. In controls and anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices, the microglia were mainly in the ramified form, in contrast to the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices where microglia were more of the reactive form (Fig <3b>). Total numbers of Iba1 positive microglial cells were reduced to 50% in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices when compared to controls (Fig. <3c>, bar 2). The opposite result was observed in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices where the microglial number was increased by 100% compared to controls (Fig. <3c>, bar 3). Since the number of microglia is inversely correlated with the number of stem/progenitor cells in the granular cell layer [<28>] this data argues that neurogenesis is enhanced in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices. rhetorical Fig. 3 Decrease in microglial number in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices and increased microgliosis in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices.

Since the number of microglia is inversely correlated with the number of stem/progenitor cells in the granular cell layer [<28>] this data argues that neurogenesis is enhanced in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices. We further investigated the number of branches in microglia, aiming to address the activation status of microglial cells in slice cultures. The branch number was counted manually with ImageJ software. The anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices had ramified form of microglia with 6-7 branches on an average indicating that the microglial cells were in their normal physiologically active form and there is no sign of inflammation (Fig <3d>, bars 1 and 2). On the contrary, microglia in pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices, were increased in number and were also observed with 2-3 branches on an average compared to age-matched controls and also the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices (Fig. <3d>, bar 3). This indicates that in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices the microglia are in a reactive form, indicating that there is also enhanced inflammation. Astrocytes are needed for normal neurotransmission, to take up glutamate, reduce excitotoxicity [<2>] and to regulate the ionic microenvironment in the brain. Morphological changes in astrocytes are related to brain plasticity, synaptogenesis and aging. In particular, hypertrophic astrocytes (with more thickened processes) are increased in the aging brain [<79>]. OHSCs from control, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices were fixed at DIV30 and immunostained for astrocytes with GFAP antibody (Fig. <4a>). The control slices had star-shaped astrocytes typical of the normal physiological forms having prominent cell bodies with 8-10 processes ranging from 6-10μm in length (Fig. 4a1). The anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices had smaller cell bodies with thin, long and slender branches (Fig. 4a2). Such astrocytes are thought to be related to maturation of synapses between hippocampal neurons [<11>]. On the contrary the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed hypertrophic astrocytes with prominent cell bodies with 1-3 processes ranging from 3-5μm in length, which can be compared to the degrading forms of astrocytes (Fig. 4a3). Because of these morphological differences in the GFAP immunostaining and the ambiguities in counting astrocyte cell numbers we further checked for GFAP protein levels by western blotting. The OHSCs at DIV30 were collected and homogenized for biochemical protein analysis by a GFAP antibody, revealing that the GFAP protein content was roughly comparable in the controls, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices (Fig <4b> and <c>). rhetorical Fig. 4 Decrease of hypertrophic astrocytes in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices but no changes in the global GFAP content. a OHSCs from controls, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK P8 pups were prepared and cultured until DIV30. Slices were stained with GFAP antibody (green) to label astrocytes. The control slices at DIV30 showed star-shaped astrocytes (left). In anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices the astrocytes have smaller cell bodies and long, thin processes (middle). By contrast, pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed hypertrophic astrocytes (right) with fewer processes which are typical of neurodegeneration. b Biochemical analysis of GFAP protein levels. Protein extracts from OHSCs of control, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices at DIV30 were subjected to western blot (loading 3μg/lane) to analyze for GFAP protein levels. c Quantification of the western blots showing that the GFAP protein contents of the three samples are similar. Results are given as mean ±SEM of 4-6 slices per mice and 5-6 mice and represent the ratio between GFAP and actin levels. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test Astrocytes are needed for normal neurotransmission, to take up glutamate, reduce excitotoxicity [<2>] and to regulate the ionic microenvironment in the brain. Morphological changes in astrocytes are related to brain plasticity, synaptogenesis and aging. In particular, hypertrophic astrocytes (with more thickened processes) are increased in the aging brain [<79>]. OHSCs from control, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices were fixed at DIV30 and immunostained for astrocytes with GFAP antibody (Fig. <4a>). The control slices had star-shaped astrocytes typical of the normal physiological forms having prominent cell bodies with 8-10 processes ranging from 6-10μm in length (Fig. 4a1). The anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices had smaller cell bodies with thin, long and slender branches (Fig. 4a2). Such astrocytes are thought to be related to maturation of synapses between hippocampal neurons [<11>]. On the contrary the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed hypertrophic astrocytes with prominent cell bodies with 1-3 processes ranging from 3-5μm in length, which can be compared to the degrading forms of astrocytes (Fig. 4a3). Because of these morphological differences in the GFAP immunostaining and the ambiguities in counting astrocyte cell numbers we further checked for GFAP protein levels by western blotting. The OHSCs at DIV30 were collected and homogenized for biochemical protein analysis by a GFAP antibody, revealing that the GFAP protein content was roughly comparable in the controls, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices (Fig <4b> and <c>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the controls and the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices there was a uniform axonal distribution of Tau in the hippocampus (Fig. <5>, A1 and 2). The pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed intense mislocalization of Tau in the somato-dendritic compartment, the most affected being the CA3 pyramidal neurons (Fig. <5>, A3). We further checked for the total Tau levels in all the groups. Endogenous mouse Tau (comprising mainly the 4R isoforms) runs at a molecular weight of ~50-60 kDa, whereas the exogenous human anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK run at 13 kD. Surprisingly, there was an ~80% increase in the endogenous mouse Tau level in slices obtained from pups expressing anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP (Fig. <5b> lane 2 and <5c> bar 2), compared with age matched non-transgenic controls and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK (Fig. <5b> lane 1 and 3; and <5c> lane 1 and 3). In spite of this increase, there was little mislocalization of Tau (endogenous or exogenous) into the somato-dendritic compartment in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP (Fig. <5>, A2). By contrast, pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed no overall increase in endogenous mouse Tau (rather a 20% decrease), yet pronounced mislocalization (Fig. <5>, A3). rhetorical Fig. 5 Increased endogenous Tau in anti-aggregant TauRD∆KPP slices at DIV30. a OHSCs from control, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK P8 pups were cultured until DIV30. Slices were stained with K9JA (pan Tau antibody) for the distribution of Tau. The control and the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices show uniform axonal distribution of Tau as detected by K9JA. By contrast the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slice shows mislocalization of Tau into the somato-dendritic compartment, most prominently in the CA3 region (arrows). b Tau levels at DIV30: Protein extracts from OHSCs of controls, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP and pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices were analyzed by western blotting using Tau antibody K9JA (loading 3μg/lane). c Quantification of the western blot showed a 80%increase in the amount of mouse Tau (by K9JA staining) in the anti-aggregant Tau RD∆KPP slice cultures when compared to the controls. There was a 20% reduction in the amount of Tau observed between the pro-aggregant Tau RD∆K and the control slices.

In spite of this increase, there was little mislocalization of Tau (endogenous or exogenous) into the somato-dendritic compartment in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP (Fig. <5>, A2). By contrast, pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices showed no overall increase in endogenous mouse Tau (rather a 20% decrease), yet pronounced mislocalization (Fig. <5>, A3). To confirm that the increase in endogenous mouse Tau was due to the expression of the anti-aggregant Tau, we further performed the switch-off experiments in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices. From DIV15 until DIV30 the anti-aggregant slices were treated with DOX to switch off the expression of the anti-aggregant Tau. This lead to a strong reduction (~70%) of the endogenous mouse Tau (Fig. <10c>, lane3). Since GSK3ß is a major Tau kinase involved in Tau phosphorylation and neurogenesis [<34>] we checked for the total levels of GSK3ß and its active form in brain lysates. However, there was no significant difference between controls and anti-aggregant mice (Additional file <1>: Figure S2B). Because of the overall increase in hippocampal neuronal number in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices (Fig. <2a>) we suspected an enhanced proliferation of hippocampal stem cells. Neurogenesis within the brain is demonstrated using an exogenous cell tracer, Bromodeoxy uridine (BrdU) which incorporates into the dividing cells during DNA synthesis. OHSCs are a suitable model to study postnatal neurogenesis [<59>]. BrdU labeling in OHSCs was done by adding freshly prepared 50μM BrdU in 1 ml of slice culture media. Since BrdU is incorporated into DNA during mitosis, its density decreases during successive cell divisions [<20>]. We therefore added 50μM BrdU into the slice culture media every second day after media exchange, thereby preventing the disappearance of highly proliferating cells as seen by BrdU immune-reactivity. The application of BrdU in the slice cultures began at DIV15 until DIV30. The OHSCs were immunostained for BrdU for proliferating cells at DIV30, revealing BrdU positive cells in the CA1, CA3, and DG (Fig. <6b>). Such cells were found in controls, anti-aggregant and pro-aggregant slices and in all the regions of the hippocampus, consistent with reports showing that there could be a reorganization of the neurogenic niche in the OHSCs during the culturing period [<37>]. However, in case of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices there was a remarkable 30% increase in the number of BrdU positive cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions and almost 100% increase in DG (Fig. <6b>, bar 2, 5, and 8). This was in striking contrast to the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices where there was no significant difference in the number of BrdU positive cells compared to the age matched controls (Fig. <6b>, bar 3, 6, and 9). Having confirmed the increase in proliferation in the anti-aggregant slices, we wanted to check whether the proliferating cells mature into neurons. BrdU was applied to the culture media from DIV15 until DIV 30, followed by double immunostaining with BrdU for the proliferating cells and NeuN for mature neurons. This showed that most of the cells were double-positive for BrdU and NeuN. The number of cells positive for BrdU increased by 90% in the CA1, 70% in CA3 and 100% in DG region of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices (Additional file <2>: Figure S1A, bars 3, 7 and 11). Out of these BrdU positive cells certain numbers of cells were co-labeled for NeuN. In particular in the CA3 and DG regions almost 70% and in CA1 almost 50% of the new born cells got differentiated into NeuN positive neurons in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices (Additional file <2>: Figure S1A, bars 4, 8, 12). This reveals an increase in proliferation followed by an increase in neuronal differentiation in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices. By contrast, in the pro-aggregant TauRD∆K slices, the rate of proliferation in the CA3 and DG regions remained the same as seen in the controls (Additional file <2>: Figure S1B, bars 5, 7, 9, 11). This also resulted in a 30% increase in the rate of differentiation in the CA1 region of the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices (Additional file <2>: Fig. S1B, bars 2 and 4). This indicated that the expression of the pro-aggregant TauRD∆K does not have much influence on the proliferation and differentiation of the hippocampal stem cells. rhetorical Fig.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PMC5715613_6,"<7b>, bars 4, 8 and 12)  The expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP begins at an early embryonic stage of the mice. Since P8 animals were used for the preparation of OHSCs and since we observed drastic changes in hippocampal volume and neuronal number upon further ex-vivo cultivation, we analyzed these parameters in live animals at the post-natal age (P8).

During pathological conditions like Parkinson Disease (PD) and AD there is deregulation of glial-neuron interactions which can be linked to the deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Thus, the restoration of the Wnt signaling pathway is a promising approach in the field of neurodegeneration and aging [<47>]. Because of the relationships of Wnt5a signaling and neurogenesis we checked the level of Wnt5a in control and anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices (Fig. <10a>). OHSCs were cultured until DIV30 and doxycycline was added from DIV15 to DIV30 to some of the slices in order to switch-off the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP. The OHSCs were then collected for biochemical analysis. Surprisingly there was a 50% reduction in the amount of Wnt5a protein in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices compared to controls (Fig. <10a>, lane 2, bar 2). However, when the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP was switched off by DOX, there was an even more pronounced reduction in Wnt5a level (Fig. <10a>, lane 3, bar 3).

There was a pronounced reduction (40% below the control levels) when the expression of anti-aggregant TauRD∆KPP was switched off from DIV15 to DIV30 (bar 3). c There was 80% increase in the Tau levels as detected by the pan Tau antibody K9JA in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slice cultures (bar 2). When the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP was switched off from DIV15 to DIV30 the Tau level was reduced by 40% to that in the controls (bar 3) The Wnt signaling pathway is known to be involved in neurogenesis and neuroinflammation [<35>]. During pathological conditions like Parkinson Disease (PD) and AD there is deregulation of glial-neuron interactions which can be linked to the deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Thus, the restoration of the Wnt signaling pathway is a promising approach in the field of neurodegeneration and aging [<47>]. Because of the relationships of Wnt5a signaling and neurogenesis we checked the level of Wnt5a in control and anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices (Fig. <10a>). OHSCs were cultured until DIV30 and doxycycline was added from DIV15 to DIV30 to some of the slices in order to switch-off the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP. The OHSCs were then collected for biochemical analysis. Surprisingly there was a 50% reduction in the amount of Wnt5a protein in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices compared to controls (Fig. <10a>, lane 2, bar 2). However, when the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP was switched off by DOX, there was an even more pronounced reduction in Wnt5a level (Fig. <10a>, lane 3, bar 3). This indicates that the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP reduces the expression of Wnt5a irreversibly. In aged hematopoietic stem cells the increase in Wnt5a levels acts as a molecular switch from canonical to non-canonical pathway, which thereby results in stem cell aging [<25>]. Wnt-β-catenin canonical signaling plays an important role in brain development and can modulate synaptic function [<78>]. Astrocytes play a major role in maintaining the subgranular zone (SGZ) and astrocyte-derived factors promote neurogenesis [<5>, <68>], one of them being the canonical Wnt3 [<51>].This prompted us to check whether such a molecular switch also exists in the mouse hippocampus. Hippocampal tissue lysates from DIV30 OHSCs were subjected to western blot analysis against Wnt3. Unexpectedly the Wnt3 levels in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices were increased substantially (up to 85%) compared to the age-matched control slices (Fig. <10b>, lane 2, bar 2). To confirm that this is due to the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP, we applied DOX to the slice cultures from DIV15 until DIV30 to switch off the expression. Remarkably, this caused a 40% reduction of the Wnt3 level compared to control slices (Fig. <10b>, lane 3, bar 3). This underscores the fact that the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP causes a strong enhancement of Wnt3 levels. As mentioned above, anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP slices had 80% more endogenous mouse Tau compared to the age matched control slices (Fig. <10c>, lane 2, bar2). When the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP was switched off by DOX, the endogenous mouse Tau was reduced to 20% below the control level (Fig. <10c>, lane 3, bar 3). This suggests that the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP is needed for the increased proliferation of newborn neurons, and since these new born neurons need endogenous mouse Tau for their migration, differentiation, and maturation, there is enhanced expression of endogenous mouse Tau. It has also been shown in previous studies that neuronal migration and maturation is inhibited in mouse brain after Tau reduction [<66>]. This data revealed that anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP has an effect on proliferation, differentiation, and higher expression of endogenous mouse Tau. The Fig. <11> illustrates the time course of changes in hippocampal volumes in the mice, normalized to the values of the controls at each age (=100%, grey bars). The values of the anti-aggregant mice lie consistently above those of the controls (pink bars), whereas pro-aggregant mice show smaller values (blue bars). The relative increase for the anti-aggregant mice are more pronounced at the earlier time points (P8 and 3 mo), in agreement with the enhanced neurogenesis. In case of the pro-aggregant mice the hippocampal volume decreases at advanced age due to the loss of neurons caused by the toxic Tau. rhetorical Fig. 11 Hippocampal volume vs. age.

PMC5715613_8,"The values of the anti-aggregant mice lie consistently above those of the controls (pink bars), whereas pro-aggregant mice show smaller values (blue bars)  The relative increase for the anti-aggregant mice are more pronounced at the earlier time points (P8 and 3 mo), in agreement with the enhanced neurogenesis. In case of the pro-aggregant mice the hippocampal volume decreases at advanced age due to the loss of neurons caused by the toxic Tau. The background of this work is the earlier observation that expression of pro-aggregant forms of Tau cause the typical signs of tau pathology (e.g. hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, loss of synapses and neurons, cognitive deficits), whereas anti-aggregant forms do not [<56>, <71>, <72>]. These results strongly supported the notion that the aggregation of Tau (or at least its propensity for β-structure) is intimately linked to the disease process, and appeared to suggest that anti-aggregant Tau is only a neutral bystander in the functioning of neurons. However, the mechanisms of Tau-induced toxicity are still uncertain, and therefore we wanted to characterize mice expressing anti-aggregant Tau in more detail in order to understand the principal differences between the two forms of Tau. To this end we analyzed regulatable mice expressing anti-aggregant repeat domain (TauRDΔKPP) and organotypic hippocampal slices (OHSCs) derived from them, and compared them with mice expressing the pro-aggregant repeat domain TauRDΔK.The OHSCs of mice expressing anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP developed pronounced changes in brain structure (as observed at DIV30), starting with a massive increase in the overall hippocampal volume and number of neurons (by 50 to 80% in the CA1, CA3 and DG regions). By contrast, the OHSCs expressing the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK showed a pronounced loss of neurons (20 to 40 % in CA1, CA3 and DG). The increase in neuronal number in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs was the first indication that hippocampal neurogenesis could be enhanced even beyond the standard regions (subgranular zone).It is known that adult hippocampal neurogenesis decreases with age in rodents and humans [<45>]. Contrary to expectations, the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs revealed a ~100% increase in hippocampal stem cell proliferation in DG and ~30% increase in CA1 and CA3 as assessed by the BrdU incorporation assay. However, there was no change in BrdU positive proliferating cells in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK OHSCs, compared to controls. This clearly shows that only the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP influences hippocampal stem cell proliferation whereas the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK does not. The enhanced proliferation in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs was followed by enhanced neuronal differentiation as assessed by DCX (Additional file <3>: Figure S3) and Ki67 (Additional file <4>: Figure S4) positive cells, resulting in an increase in NeuN positive mature neurons. Thus the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP enhances the rate of proliferation as well as the rate of differentiation.Having seen a massive increase in neuronal proliferation and differentiation in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs, we speculated whether there are changes in the overall expression and distribution of the endogenous mouse Tau, considering that Tau is involved in neuronal maturation and migration [<66>], and that the knock-down of Tau causes delay in stem cell maturation, retarded axonal and neuronal outgrowth [<19>]. Indeed the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs showed an 80% increase of endogenous mouse tau which was not seen in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices. Such an increase in endogenous mouse Tau would be expected to increase microtubule mass and stability in cells [<38>] and also to enhance outgrowth of cell processes and neurites in Sf9 and PC12 cells [<43>] and to promote neuronal morphogenesis [<31>, <42>]. This increase in the endogenous mouse Tau in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs may be necessary for the morphogenesis of the newly developing neurons, thereby emphasizing the important role of Tau for normal differentiation and maturation of neurons. In other mouse models, an increase in endogenous Tau resulted in enhanced LTP in the DG region of the hippocampus and thereby improved memory (but without enhanced neurogenesis), consistent with improved reversal learning and fear conditioning [<3>, <9>]. A similar effect was also observed in our anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP mice that showed a robust increase of LTP in the CA1 region (see Fig. <10c> in [<72>]).When the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP was switched-off from DIV15 to DIV30 in OHSCs, there was a reduction in the rate of proliferation (25% to 35% in CA1, CA3 and DG), differentiation (20% to 40% in CA1, CA3 and DG) compared to the switch-ON conditions, and a reduction of expression of endogenous mouse Tau (20%) compared to controls. This confirms that the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP is coupled to an increased level of endogenous mouse Tau in a reversible manner.The advantage of OHSCs is that the complexity of the brain structure is well maintained. Therefore this system can be used as an ex-vivo model for neuronal development and degradation [<50>]. Apart from neurons, non-neuronal cell types like astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes are present and their origin and development can be studied [<7>, <53>]. For example, with the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP there was a dramatic reduction (~50%) in the number of microglia compared to controls. By contrast, in the pro-aggregant TauRDΔK slices there was a pronounced increase (100%) in the microglial number indicating massive neuroinflammation. Previous studies have shown that microglia are needed for (i) pruning of dendritic spines (ii) modulation of the pre- and postsynaptic structure of synapses on newborn neurons [<60>], (iii) maintenance of homeostasis of the neurogenic niche by the removal of newly born cells by apoptosis, and (iv) secretion of anti-inflammatory factors like IL10 and growth factors [<63>] which in turn regulate adult neurogenesis. Some studies have shown that the number of microglia are inversely correlated with the number of stem/progenitor cells, as shown in mice [<70>] and in co-culture experiments, despite the absence of inflammatory stimuli [<61>]. These studies match with our data regarding enhanced neurogenesis and reduced neuroinflammation in the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs. Astrocytes exert profound effects on neuronal development as they provide support for neuronal survival, axon and dendritic outgrowth, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis [<17>, <75>]. In anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs the astrocytes were less hypertrophic, whilst in the control OHSCs they were hypertrophic as observed during normal aging. The GFAP level determined by western blotting in the hippocampal lysates from the control and anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs showed no changes in the level of GFAP. We further investigated the differentiation of NSCs into non-neuronal cell types like astrocytes and microglia in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs and found that there were no cells double-positive for GFAP and BrdU, nor for Iba1and BrdU, indicating that there was no differentiation of the proliferating cells into astrocytes or microglia (data not shown). All this data indicates that with the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP the proliferation of hippocampal NSCs leads mainly to their differentiation into neurons.Considering the increase in proliferation and neuronal numbers in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP OHSCs, we were interested to analyze whether these changes are restricted to the slice cultures, or whether they occurred also in postnatal animals. Anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP mice were therefore analyzed at post-natal day 8 (P8) for BrdU positive proliferating cells. The post-natal neurogenesis, a transition state between embryonic and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, is important because it provides information about how neurogenesis continues into adulthood [<58>].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5715613_9,"Previous reports had shown that during post-natal stages of brain development the hilus region of the hippocampus shows more neurogenesis [<1>] and more than half of the granule cells are born post-natally (P5-P14)  We observed an increase of BrdU positive cells at P8 in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP pups. This was observed only in CA3 (80%), a region where enhanced proliferation of BrdU positive cells has not been reported so far. Consistent with this, the overall hippocampal volume in anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP pups was increased as well (~25% at P8, compared to controls). This gain of volume persisted through adolescence (30% at 3 months) and even in adult life (15% at 16 months). By contrast, the hippocampal volume of pro-aggregant mice remained comparable to controls through adolescence (3 months), but then lagged behind controls in adult life (25% reduction at 16 months). This effect appears to be related mainly to the loss of neurons by neurodegeneration during adulthood, because the rate of neurogenesis remained comparable to that of controls.Longitudinal changes in hippocampal volume in mice have been investigated by a number of authors, using both stereology and MRI methods [<12>, <30>, <64>]. Broadly speaking, there is a phase of rapid growth from birth to about 3-4 months, followed by an almost steady state for the following 20 months. There are modulations in the growth rates and magnitudes of the young vs. adult stages which depend on mouse strain, gender, and various genetic and other factors [<54>, <62>]. The time course observed in our experiments is consistent with published data, assuming that the adult volume is reached at about 4 months, somewhat later than the 3-month time points chosen here, which explains the increase between 3 and 16 months. However, the important feature is the systematic difference between pro- and anti-aggregant mice, relative to controls. Volumes of pro-aggregant mice are lower than controls (because neuronal generation of neurons is offset by degenerative loss), volumes of anti-aggregant mice are higher (because of enhanced neurogenesis without enhanced degeneration) (Fig. <11>). In organotypic slices at DIV30 the same features are found for neuronal numbers in all hippocampal subfields (Fig. <2>), indicating that similar relationships between neurogenesis and degeneration are already operating at early time points. Since aging processes are ~5 times faster in slices than in animals [<21>, <23>, <27>, <55>, <69>], DIV30 would correspond roughly to an adult age (5 months). By comparison, advanced age in humans is associated with a gradual decrease in volume which is exacerbated in neurodegenerative diseases [<4>, <24>]. This late phase is not pronounced in old mice because of their relatively short life span.To pin down the molecular mechanisms resulting from the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP, we investigated the role of the Wnt signaling pathways. Wnt proteins are principal regulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and play a role in adult hippocampal function [<51>]. Another hint was the increased LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP mice [<72>], as Wnt signaling plays an important role in hippocampal LTP, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation [<13>, <36>, <74>]. Wnt5a protein is up-regulated in AD brains [<49>], an increased level of Wnt5a is a marker of aging, and increased Wnt5a is a direct inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway [<25>]. In anti-aggregant mice there was a 50% drop in the Wnt5a protein level (compared to age-matched control slices). From this data we conclude that the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP suppresses Wnt5a levels and thereby enhances neurogenesis and reduces neuroinflammation in this mouse model. This is consistent with studies suggesting that upregulation of Wnt5a signaling is involved in the cognitive decline associated with aging and also with the physiopathology of AD [<6>]. In the case of Wnt3 protein, its expression persists in the hippocampus and it is mainly released by astrocytes to regulate neurogenesis. Wnt3 acts via the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [<18>, <51>] and the downstream targets are involved in promoting adult neurogenesis [<46>]. With the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP there is a clear upregulation of Wnt3 protein by 85%, concomitant with a 50% reduction of Wnt5a. A reversal of the Wnt3 upregulation is seen when the expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP was switched off by the application of DOX (the levels are reduced by 40% compared to controls). By contrast, the down regulation of Wnt5a cannot be reversed by switching off TauRDΔKPP because DOX itself has a suppressing effect on Wnt5a. The data suggest that an increase of Tau in a non-aggregating fashion enhances neurogenesis via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, without stimulating neuroinflammation. The microtubule-associated protein Tau plays a role in neurodegeneration as well as neurogenesis. Previous work has shown that the expression of the pro-aggregant mutant Tau repeat domain causes strong aggregation and pronounced neuronal loss in the hippocampus whereas the anti-aggregant form has no deleterious effects. These two proteins differ mainly in their propensity to form ß structure and hence to aggregate. To elucidate the basis of these contrasting effects, we analyzed organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) from transgenic mice expressing the repeat domain (RD) of Tau with the anti-aggregant mutation (TauRDΔKPP) and compared them with slices containing pro-aggregant TauRDΔK. Transgene expression in the hippocampus was monitored via a sensitive bioluminescence reporter gene assay (luciferase). The expression of the anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP leads to a larger volume of the hippocampus at a young age due to enhanced neurogenesis, resulting in an increase in neuronal number. There were no signs of activation of microglia and astrocytes, indicating the absence of an inflammatory reaction. Investigation of signaling pathways showed that Wnt-5a was strongly decreased whereas Wnt3 was increased. A pronounced increase in hippocampal stem cell proliferation (seen by BrdU) was observed as early as P8, in the CA regions where neurogenesis is normally not observed. The increase in neurons persisted up to 16 months of age. The data suggest that the expression of anti-aggregant TauRDΔKPP enhances hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, without an inflammatory reaction. This study points to a role of tau in brain development and neurogenesis, in contrast to its detrimental role in neurodegeneration at later age.

PMC5052533_0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Critical components of the two AD pathological pathways, Aβ-amyloidosis and Tauopathy, have been considered as therapeutic targets. Among them, much effort is focused on aberrant Tau phosphorylation and targeting Tau-phosphorylating kinases. Methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine dye that crosses the blood-brain barrier, has been shown to hit multiple molecular targets involved in AD and have beneficial effects in clinical studies. Here we present evidence that microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK4) is a novel target of MB. MB partially rescued the synaptic toxicity in Drosophila larva overexpressing PAR1 (MARK analog). In 293T culture, MB decreased MARK4-mediated Tau phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner. Further studies revealed a two-fold mechanism by MB including down-regulation of MARK4 protein level through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inhibition of MARK4 kinase activity in vitro. This study highlights the importance of MARK4 as a viable target for Tauopathy and provides fresh insight into the complex mechanism used by MB to treat AD. We thank Dr. Lester I. Binder (Northwestern University) for providing the 4R2N Tau construct. We acknowledge L K Whittier Foundation (South Pasadena, CA) for providing funding support. This research was also supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2015R1D1A1A01059079 to S.L.) and Korea Basic Science Institute (E36200, K36311 to S.L.) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and causes progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. The pathological hallmarks of AD include amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Tau, a highly soluble microtubule-binding protein, has been determined to be the major component of NFT, where it is hyperphosphorylated and becomes insoluble and filamentous<1><2>. Many kinases have been identified to regulate Tau phosphorylation, including microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, and CDK5<3><4>. In Drosophila, overexpression of PAR1, the fly homolog of MARK kinase, leads to elevated tau phosphorylation at S262 and S356 sites and increased toxicity. More importantly, the initial phosphorylation of Tau by PAR1 at S262/S356 sites is prerequisite for the subsequent multisite phosphorylation of Tau by other kinases, such as GSK-3β and CDK5<5>. In addition, a genetic screen to identify modifiers of Tauopathy in a Drosophila model revealed that kinases and phosphatases are the major factors to affect Tau toxicity<6>. These studies suggest that orderly phosphorylation of Tau increases its toxicity and pharmacological intervention of these phosphorylation reactions may represent novel therapeutic strategy for AD treatment<7>.Methylene blue (MB) is a dye that has been widely used in a range of different fields, including uses as a medicine in treating various bacterial and viral infections and cancer<8>. Recently it has been suggested that MB may have a beneficial effect on the cognitive performance of patients with AD<9><10><11> possibly by inhibiting Tau protein aggregation, although this mechanism is still under debate<12><13><14>. Recent studies also suggested other possible mechanisms for the protective functions of MB in neurons, including reducing mitochondrial superoxide production<15>, enhancing mitochondrial function<16>, upregulating Nrf2/ARE genes<17>, modulating molecular chaperone activity<18> and inducing autophagy<19>. However, the effect of MB on key Tau kinases has not been explored.Here we studied the effect of MB on MARK4 mediated Tau phosphorylation in a Drosophila model as well as in mammalian cell cultures. A demethylated analog of MB, Azure C (AC) was also tested. In a screening study, both AC and MB showed activity in regulating Tau stability through heat shock protein Hsp70<18>. Olsalazine sodium (OS), an aminosalicylate drug used to treat inflammatory bowel disease was also included as a negative control. We found that MB may function through targeting the Tau kinase MARK4, resulting in reduced Tau phosphorylation at MARK4 sites. We also showed that this novel mechanism of MB involves both inhibition of MARK4 kinase activity and down regulation of MARK4 protein level. To determine whether AC, MB and OS (<Fig. 1a>) can affect PAR1 function in vivo, we used Drosophila NMJ as the model system. Previously, it has been shown that PAR1/MARK is predominantly localized at NMJ and overexpression (OE) of PAR1 leads to decreased synapse formation and synaptic transmission<20><21>, which is mediated by Tau<22>. PAR1 OE also leads to the mislocalization of PSD-95/Dlg protein, a major synaptic substrate of PAR1<21>. To evaluate the effect of drug treatment on synapse formation, the number of type I boutons, an excitatory glutamatergic synapse, was determined by immunostaining of larval NMJ using the anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody as described previously<21><23>. Interestingly, when we fed larvae with MB at 20 μM, MB effectively rescued bouton number loss in larvae overexpressing PAR1 or human tau R406W (htauM, a pathogenic form of tau related to tauopathy) under the control of Mhc-Gal4 driver (<Fig. 1b–d>). In comparison, AC and OS showed little effect (<Fig. 1b–d>). Dlg localization was examined by double staining of larval NMJ using the anti-HRP and anti-Dlg antibodies. In PAR1 OE larvae, Dlg was diffusive and less focused to the postsynapse (<Fig. 2a>) as reported previously<21>. Both AC and MB treatment rescued the mislocalization of Dlg at NMJ, while OS was not effective (<Fig. 2a>). To test whether MB directly affects PAR1 protein level, larval muscle walls were homogenized and PAR1 levels were analyzed by Western blot (WB). As shown in <Fig. 2b,c>, PAR1 protein level at NMJ decreased after MB treatment compared to vehicle treated controls, while AC and OS were less effective. This effect of MB treatment is specific because MB failed to alter the protein level of another pathogenic kinase human leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (hLRRK2) (<Fig. S1>). These results suggest that MB may affect PAR1 activity as well as protein level in vivo. To extend our observation to mammalian system, we tested whether MB has inhibitory effect on MARK4 mediated Tau phosphorylation in mammalian cell cultures. 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding human 4R2N Tau and HA tagged MARK4 (HA-MARK4-WT). A kinase dead form of MARK4 (HA-MARK4-KD) was included as a control. As shown in <Fig. 3a>, Tau expression was detected only after transfecting the cells with mammalian Tau construct. A low level of Tau phosphorylation at the MARK4 site serine 262 (pTau S262) was observed even without co-transfection of HA-MARK4-WT, indicating an activity from endogenous MARK4 (<Fig. 3a>). The level of pTau S262 was markedly increased when the cells were co-transfected with HA-MARK4-WT but not HA-MARK4-KD. After incubation of transfected cells with increasing concentrations of MB for 3 hours, pTau S262 level was reduced in a dose dependent manner as shown by WB analysis (<Fig. 3a,b>). No significant change of total Tau protein level was observed (<Fig. 3a>). AC also inhibited Tau phosphorylation at S262, but to a lesser extent while OS had no effect, even at 100 μM.It is worth noting that we also detected high molecular weight forms of Tau (HMW Tau) when the cells were treated with high concentrations of MB and AC. The HMW Tau was seen as protein bands/smear larger than 75 kDa and appeared in both pTau and total Tau blots (<Fig. 3a>). One possibility is that phosphorylated Tau is more susceptible to MB treatment and selectively sequestered in HMW forms, resulting in apparent reduction in monomeric pTau. To test this possibility, we repeated the experiment with HA-MARK4-KD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5052533_1,"If the HMW Tau preferentially consists of pTau but not unphosphorylated Tau, it will not be detected when the cells are co-transfected with HA-MARK4-KD  As shown in <Fig. 3c>, a low level of Tau S262 was phosphorylated by endogenous MARK4 but no phosphorylated HMW Tau was observed in the absence of HA-MARK4-WT overexpression. However, HMW Tau were still detected with increasing concentrations of MB or AC in the total Tau blot (<Fig. 3c>). Therefore, MB and AC seem to cause the formation of HMW Tau irrespective of the phosphorylation state of Tau. The physiological significance of the HMW Tau formation after MB and AC treatment is not clear. Nonetheless, densitometry analysis indicates that the ratio of monomeric pTau S262/total Tau was decreased with MB or AC treatment (<Fig. 3b>). HMW Tau amounts to 18–27% of the total signal. Since HMW Tau was observed in both pTau and total Tau blots, including HMW Tau in the quantification did not significantly change their ratio and the final results.Since endogenous MARK4 activity was detected, we repeated the experiment under more physiologically relevant condition without overexpression of HA-MARK4. Similar results were observed as shown in <Fig. 4a,b> where Tau phosphorylation at S262 by endogenous MARK4 was inhibited by MB in a dose dependent manner. AC had a similar effect, but to a lesser extent whereas OS had no effect (<Fig. 4a,b>). Longer exposure was used to visualize the weaker phosphorylation signal by endogenous kinase, resulting in some nonspecific bands (<Fig. 4a>).To evaluate the selectivity of kinase inhibition by these compounds, we also measured Tau phosphorylation by other endogenous kinases at additional sites including Serine 202, 214 and 396. GSK-3β and CDK5 among other kinases have been shown to be involved in Tau phosphorylation at these sites<24>. Without any drug treatment, Tau was found to be phosphorylated at these sites. Interestingly, MB inhibited Tau phosphorylation at S396 and S214 but with reduced potency compared to the inhibition of pS262. No significant effect on pS202 was found by MB treatment (<Fig. 4a,c–e>). In contrast, AC and OS did not significantly affect the phosphorylation at any of these additional sites (<Fig. 4>). To test whether MARK4 stability is affected by treatment of the drugs in mammalian cell cultures, 293T cells are transfected with HA-MARK4 and protein levels are examined by WB. Similar to what we observed in the Drosophila model, HA-MARK4-WT protein level was down regulated by MB in a dose dependent manner (<Fig. 5a>). AC had the same effect but less potent while OS did not affect HA-MARK4-WT protein level at all concentrations (<Fig. 5a>). To further confirm this effect of MB on MARK4 protein stability, the WB was repeated using a MARK4 antibody instead of an HA antibody. This MARK4 antibody appears to only react with endogenous MARK4 even in the presence of exogenous HA-MARK4. As shown in <Supplementary Fig. S2a>, MB also down-regulates endogenous MARK4 protein level in a dose dependent manner. Similarly, AC reduced endogenous MARK4 protein level, but to a lesser extent, while OS showed no effect (<Fig. S2a>). To determine whether this protein level down regulation by MB is a global effect or an effect specific to MARK4, we examined by WB the endogenous protein levels of GSK-3β and CDK5. We found no change of protein levels of either of these two kinases at all concentrations of MB as well as AC and OS (<Fig. S2b>), indicating the effect of MB in 293T cells is specific to MARK4.Given the known function of PAR1 de-/ubiquitination in putative AD mechanisms<22>, we examined whether MB treatment leads to an increase of MARK4 ubiquitination. After MB treatment, HA-MARK4-WT was immunoprecipiated and its ubiquitination was analyzed by WB using an anti-Ub antibody. As shown in <Fig. 5b>, an increase of high molecular weight smear was caused by MB treatment in a dose dependent manner, indicating an increase of HA-MARK4-WT ubiqitination by MB. To further confirm ubquitinated HA-MARK4 is degraded by proteasome, the cells were pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 followed by MB treatment. When HA-MARK4-WT protein level was analyzed by WB, an accumulation of high molecular weight poly-ubiquitinated HA-MARK4-WT was observed in the presence of MG132, indicating that 26S proteasome complex is at least in part responsible for the increased MARK4 degradation (<Fig. 5c>). To determine whether MB directly affects MARK4 kinase activity, we tested the phosphorylation of Tau by MARK4 in the presence or absence of MB using a cell-free kinase assay system. Purified recombinant GST-MARK4 from a commercial source was used. When MB was added directly to the kinase reaction, we observed a concentration dependent decrease of GST-MARK4 mediated Tau phosphorylation (<Fig. 6a,b>). Interestingly, this phosphorylation appeared to be inversely correlated with the formation of a higher molecular weight band which appears to be GST-MARK4 dimers (<Fig. 6a>). Inhibition of Tau phosphorylation and GST-MARK4 dimer formation was also observed with AC treatment (<Fig. 6a,b>). When OS was tested under the same condition, no inhibition of GST-MARK4 mediated Tau phosphorylation was observed (<Fig. 6a,b>). Neither was any GST-MARK4 dimer formation.To confirm the results of this kinase assay and investigate whether this dimer formation is dependent on the GST tag, the kinase assay was repeated with MARK4 obtained by immunoprecipitation from 293T cells overexpressing the HA tagged kinase instead of GST-MARK4. As shown in <Supplementary Fig. S3>, immunoprecipitated HA-MARK4-WT effectively phosphorylated Tau at S262 site as shown by WB, while HA-MARK4-KD failed to do so. The same dose dependent inhibitory effect of MB on Tau phosphorylation was observed (<Supplementary Fig. S3>). Increased formation of HA-MARK4-WT dimer with increased concentration of MB was also observed, indicating that the dimer formation is independent of the tag.Some HMW Tau was also observed (<Fig. 6a>). However, it was detected even without drug treatment and the slight change of its density did not correlate with the concentration of the drugs. Therefore, the decreased Tau phosphorylation at S262 upon treatment with MB and AC cannot be accounted for by the HMW Tau formation. It has been proposed that aberrant hyperphosphorylation of Tau -likely caused by the imbalance between kinase and phosphatase activities- is the initiating event of a pathogenic cascade that leads to neuronal death<7>. More than two dozen protein kinases phosphorylate Tau in vitro and in vivo<25><26>. Therefore a plausible and desirable therapeutic target would be to inhibit Tau kinases. Among those kinases, CDK5, GSK-3β and MARK have been proposed as the three major kinases responsible for phosphorylating the majority of epitopes that are present in paired helical filament (PHF) form of Tau<7><25><27>. Selective and non-selective inhibitors of CDK5 and GSK-3β have been developed<26><28>. But none has shown beneficial effect for AD in clinical studies. Although MARK has been shown to play an important role in Tauopathy, no MARK specific inhibitor has been developed except for one study reporting the use of a peptide inhibitor derived from the CagA protein of Helicobacter pylori<20>. In this study, we provide evidence both in vivo and in vitro that MARK4 and its Drosophila homolog PAR1 are putative targets of MB. Previous studies have identified multiple targets of MB including Tau itself, but none has explored its effects on Tau kinases. Our mechanistic study revealed both down regulation of kinase protein level and inhibition of kinase activity. These findings emphasized the importance of Tau kinase MARK4 as a therapeutic target and identified novel mechanisms of action by MB as an AD drug.Whether MB’s effect on Tau phosphorylation is specific to MARK4 site remains unclear. In transfected 293T cells, Western blot revealed that Tau phosphorylation by other kinases was also reduced by MB (<Fig. 4>). Nonetheless it showed that the inhibition of pS262 is the most potent compared to other kinase sites (<Fig. 4>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5052533_2,"Since there is evidence that Tau phosphorylation at S262 is required for subsequent multisite phosphorylation<5>, it is possible that the reduced phosphorylation at these other sites is simply caused by the lack of the priming event, rather than direct inhibition by MB  To fully address this issue, a pseudophosphorylated Tau with a Serine 262 to Aspartate mutation can be used in future studies.Another concern raised from the studies of transfected 293T cells is the observation of HWM Tau when cells were treated with high concentrations of MB. There is evidence that Tau oligomers are the toxic form of Tau in neurodegenerative disease<29>. Further study showed that Tau oligomerization in AD and related Tauopathies is hyperphosphorylation-dependent<30>. However, the formation of HWM Tau under the treatment of MB in this study is not hyperphosphorylation-dependent. As shown in <Fig. 3c>, unphosphorylated Tau also forms HWM bands when treated with MB. It will be interesting to examine the nature of the HWM Tau and its physiological role in future studies.We provide evidence that down-regulation of MARK4 protein level by MB is specific and at least in part through degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<Fig. 5>). Lee et al. showed that phosphorylated PAR1 is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by Slimb, the Drosophila SCF (Skp_Cul1_F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex<22>. They also showed that Slimb’s action is antagonized by the deubiquitinase fat facets (FAF). In addition, Ub-specific protease 9X (USP9X), the putative mammalian homologue of FAF, was also identified to catalyze the removal of polyubiquitin chains from MARK4<31>. However, in this study, Lys(29)/Lys(33)-linked polyubiquitin chains seem to only affect MARK4 kinase activity, not stability. Based on these studies, a deubiquitinase is a possible target of MB through which the stability of MARK4 is regulated. Future studies may focus on whether MB affects USP9X or other deubiquitinases and which ubiquitination sites are involved. Other studies have shown that MB induces autophagy/macroautophagy resulting in direct reduction of Tau protein level or AMPK activation<19><32>. Interestingly, a recent study of hippocampal tissues from AD cases revealed colocalization of MARK4 and pTau S262 in granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVDs)-vacuoles with characteristics of autophagic system and correlation with AD brains<33>. Therefore, it is possible that increased autophagy induced by MB also facilitates the clearance of MARK4.Our in vitro kinase assay results indicate that MB directly inhibits Tau phosphorylation by MARK4 at Ser262 (<Fig. 6>). An interesting observation is that inhibition seems to correlate with MARK4 dimerization which is also seen with AC but not OS. Regulation by dimerization is not a rare feature of kinases. In fact, there is evidence that Tau phosphorylation by MARK2 is suppressed by the heterodimerization of MARK2 with another kinase, PAK5<34>. Crystal structures have been determined for MARK1, 2 and 3, all consisting of homodimers<35>. The predicated structure of MARK4 has a similar domain organization<35><36>. Therefore, it is possible that homodimerization is a mechanism for MARK4 inhibition, though in vivo evidence is still lacking. Based on these reports, we speculate that MB may inhibit MARK4 by stabilizing its dimer, possibly by covalent cross-linking of dimerized MARK4. Previous studies focused on how MB affects Tau fibril formation have found that MB causes cysteine oxidization, resulting in modified cysteine residues and/or intra and intermolecular disulfide bonds<13><14>. Since the WB analysis in this study was performed under reducing condition, disulfide bonds formation is unlikely. The nature of this dimerization and its physiological relevance remains to be investigated.Although PAR1-Tau axis has been shown to play a crucial role in AD processes, which Aβ toxicity and/or other triggers are likely to impinge on<20>, it seems that kinase inhibition alone or inhibition of one kinase is not sufficient to achieve better clinical outcome. A growing body of evidence suggests that MB has multiple molecular targets throughout AD pathways<9><13><14><16><17><18><19><32>. The identification of the novel target and mechanisms of MB reported in this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of its neuroprotective effect and contributes to the development of more efficient therapeutics/combination therapy for the multi-factorial Alzheimer’s disease.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Critical components of the two AD pathological pathways, Aβ-amyloidosis and Tauopathy, have been considered as therapeutic targets. Among them, much effort is focused on aberrant Tau phosphorylation and targeting Tau-phosphorylating kinases. Methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine dye that crosses the blood-brain barrier, has been shown to hit multiple molecular targets involved in AD and have beneficial effects in clinical studies. Here we present evidence that microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK4) is a novel target of MB. MB partially rescued the synaptic toxicity in Drosophila larva overexpressing PAR1 (MARK analog). In 293T culture, MB decreased MARK4-mediated Tau phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner. Further studies revealed a two-fold mechanism by MB including down-regulation of MARK4 protein level through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inhibition of MARK4 kinase activity in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PMC4256087_0,"Pathological aggregates of phosphorylated TDP-43 characterize amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), two devastating groups of neurodegenerative disease. Kinase hyperactivity may be a consistent feature of ALS and FTLD-TDP, as phosphorylated TDP-43 is not observed in the absence of neurodegeneration. By examining changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation state, we have identified kinases controlling TDP-43 phosphorylation in a C. elegans model of ALS. In this kinome-wide survey, we identified homologs of the tau tubulin kinases 1 and 2 (TTBK1 and TTBK2), which were also identified in a prior screen for kinase modifiers of TDP-43 behavioral phenotypes. Using refined methodology, we demonstrate TTBK1 and TTBK2 directly phosphorylate TDP-43 in vitro and promote TDP-43 phosphorylation in mammalian cultured cells. TTBK1/2 overexpression drives phosphorylation and relocalization of TDP-43 from the nucleus to cytoplasmic inclusions reminiscent of neuropathologic changes in disease states. Furthermore, protein levels of TTBK1 and TTBK2 are increased in frontal cortex of FTLD-TDP patients, and TTBK1 and TTBK2 co-localize with TDP-43 inclusions in ALS spinal cord. These kinases may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention for TDP-43 proteinopathies such as ALS and FTLD-TDP. Aggregated proteins are a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. In ALS and FTLD-TDP, these aggregates contain abnormal TDP-43 modified by phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation normally controls protein activity, stability, or location, but in some neurodegenerative diseases the phosphorylated proteins accumulate in excess. Kinases are the enzymes responsible for protein phosphorylation. We have identified two TDP-43 kinases, TTBK1 and TTBK2, using a novel approach combining reverse genetics and biochemical screening to identify the kinases responsible for changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation. We show TTBK1 and TTBK2 directly phosphorylate TDP-43 in vitro, and control TDP-43 phosphorylation in cellular and simple animal models of ALS. This has uncovered a molecular mechanism by which pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 can occur in disease. To determine whether changes in TTBK1/2 protein are contributing to TDP-43 pathology, we examined diseased brain and spinal cord tissue from patients with ALS or FTLD-TDP. We observed changes in the abundance of TTBK1 and TTBK2 in disease-affected neurons, and the coexistence of TTBK1/2 with phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates in both FTLD-TDP and ALS. Therefore, increased abundance or activity of TTBK1 or TTBK2 may contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in ALS and FTLD-TDP.

Ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated inclusions of the protein TDP-43 characterize disease-affected neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD-TDP) <[1]>,<[2]>. Mutations in the human gene coding for TDP-43, TARDBP, were found to cause ALS in a subset of affected families, supporting a causal role for TDP-43 in disease initiation <[3]>–<[7]>. In addition to being the hallmark lesions in ALS and FTLD-TDP, inclusions containing TDP-43 are varyingly present in some other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Huntington's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) <[8]>–<[12]>, where the severity of TDP-43 pathologic change is associated with the rate of cognitive decline in affected patients <[13]>. Many model systems including C. elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice, and rats have demonstrated neurotoxicity resulting from mutant TDP-43 <[14]>–<[19]>. Therefore, TDP-43 pathologic change is not merely a hallmark of disease, but TDP-43 dysfunction can cause neurodegeneration.TDP-43 undergoes a number of pathological modifications in disease-affected neurons including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing. These modifications may promote aggregation and the formation of detergent-insoluble inclusions. The precise molecular cause underlying neurotoxicity in most TDP-43 proteinopathies remains unclear, although the toxicity of mutant TDP-43 expressed in multiple model systems indicates it may be acting through a gain-of-function mechanism via aberrant interactions with proteins and/or nucleic acids <[20]>. Phosphorylation is a robust and consistent hallmark of pathological TDP-43, and detection of phosphorylation at tandem serines 409 and 410 characterizes virtually all TDP-43 proteinopathy cases <[21]>, <[22]>.In order to investigate the causes driving pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation, we have developed a C. elegans model of TDP-43 proteinopathy exhibiting TDP-43 phosphorylation dependent neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity; in C. elegans, phosphorylation of TDP-43 at serines 409 and 410 suffices to promote TDP-43 mediated neurotoxicity <[14]>. Further, we have used the model to previously identify the kinase CDC7 as a direct modulator of TDP-43 motor phenotypes <[23]>. This work also showed multiple kinases regulate TDP-43 phosphorylation in C. elegans, because detectable phosphorylated TDP-43 remains in the absence of CDC7. Inhibition of the kinases CDC7 or CK1 has also been shown to reduce but not eliminate TDP-43 phosphorylation in cultured cells <[23]>, <[24]>. Here we utilize the direct detection of changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis of TDP-43 phosphorylation state to discover additional TDP-43 kinases in C. elegans. We have identified homologs of the tau tubulin kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2 and characterized their function as regulators of TDP-43 phosphorylation. TTBK1/2 may be attractive drug targets for therapeutic interventions in TDP-43 proteinopathies such as FTLD-TDP and ALS. To identify TDP-43 kinases, we undertook a comprehensive survey utilizing kinase-targeting RNAi coupled with direct immunoblot detection of changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation in C. elegans. We have assembled an RNAi library targeting 451 predicted kinase genes in C. elegans (95% coverage of the predicted kinases found in the C. elegans genome, Table S1). This library has been previously employed to identify kinase modifiers of TDP-43 dependent behavioral phenotypes, and identified CDC7 as a direct TDP-43 kinase responsible for promoting TDP-43 neurotoxicity <[23]>. However, CDC7 is not solely responsible for the phosphorylation observed in our C. elegans model as detectable phosphorylation at S409/410 is still observed in a cdc-7(−/−) null mutant background. Thus other kinases play conserved roles phosphorylating TDP-43, and previous behavior-based screening may have failed to uncover kinases with multiple roles in vivo, or kinases whose loss of function could adversely impact motor function or viability independent of TDP-43. To identify additional TDP-43 kinases, a direct biochemical assay of TDP-43 phosphorylation in TDP-43 transgenic C. elegans was used to screen for alterations in pS409/410 TDP-43 phosphorylation. Populations of transgenic C. elegans expressing ALS-mutant M337V TDP-43 were grown on bacteria producing double stranded RNA targeting each kinase, then harvested and tested by immunoblot for changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation (<S1 Figure>). Transgenic C. elegans expressing ALS mutant TDP-43 exhibit post-translational modification of TDP-43 including prominent phosphorylation <[14]> in addition to altered proteolytic processing and ubiquitination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4256087_1,"Candidate TDP-43 modifying kinases were selected whose knockdown by RNAi robustly reduced the observed TDP-43 phosphorylation relative to control treated animals  Apparent hits were retested by RNAi and immunoblot to confirm decreased TDP-43 phosphorylation, and the identity of positive RNAi clones was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Candidate kinases with human homologs acting on serine and/or threonine residues (S/T) were selected for further analysis. A total of 7 candidate S/T kinases were identified that consistently decreased TDP-43 S409/410 phosphorylation following RNAi treatment (<Table 1>). Interestingly, two of these kinases, cdc-7 and mlk-1, were identified previously in behavior-based screening for TDP-43 kinases <[23]>.

To identify additional TDP-43 kinases, a direct biochemical assay of TDP-43 phosphorylation in TDP-43 transgenic C. elegans was used to screen for alterations in pS409/410 TDP-43 phosphorylation. Populations of transgenic C. elegans expressing ALS-mutant M337V TDP-43 were grown on bacteria producing double stranded RNA targeting each kinase, then harvested and tested by immunoblot for changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation (<S1 Figure>). Transgenic C. elegans expressing ALS mutant TDP-43 exhibit post-translational modification of TDP-43 including prominent phosphorylation <[14]> in addition to altered proteolytic processing and ubiquitination. Candidate TDP-43 modifying kinases were selected whose knockdown by RNAi robustly reduced the observed TDP-43 phosphorylation relative to control treated animals. Apparent hits were retested by RNAi and immunoblot to confirm decreased TDP-43 phosphorylation, and the identity of positive RNAi clones was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Candidate kinases with human homologs acting on serine and/or threonine residues (S/T) were selected for further analysis. A total of 7 candidate S/T kinases were identified that consistently decreased TDP-43 S409/410 phosphorylation following RNAi treatment (<Table 1>). Interestingly, two of these kinases, cdc-7 and mlk-1, were identified previously in behavior-based screening for TDP-43 kinases <[23]>. Behavior-based screening also identified three additional homologs of the mammalian tau tubulin kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2, in the CK1 group. The CK1 group of kinases has greatly expanded in C. elegans, from 12 members in humans to 86 members in C. elegans, including 32 TTBK and TTBKL (TTBK-like) family members <[25]>. The dramatic expansion of the CK1 family of kinases in C. elegans suggests a diversification of functional roles for the TTBK1/2 like kinases in the nematode.RNAi can inactivate multiple genes simultaneously depending on their sequence similarity, potentially confounding the identification of any single gene responsible for TDP-43 phosphorylation. To unambiguously determine the effects of single kinase gene loss of function on TDP-43 phosphorylation, we generated TDP-43 transgenic animals with viable deletion mutants eliminating the kinase active domain of each candidate gene of interest (<Table 1>). Each of these kinase mutants was tested for changes in the amount of phosphorylated TDP-43 by immunoblot. Three of the kinase loss of function mutations tested, cdc-7(−/−), H05L14.1(−/−), and dkf-2(−/−), dramatically reduce TDP-43 phosphorylation with only moderate or no changes in total levels of TDP-43, consistent with the results from the initial RNAi screen (<Fig. 1A–C> and <S2 Figure>). We observed a slight decrease in levels of a shorter 37 kDa isoform of TDP-43 (<Fig. 1A>), but the appearance of higher or lower molecular weight species, including multimers, post-translationally modified protein species, or translational variants, appears relatively unchanged (see <S2 Figure> for the full α-TDP-43 immunoblot), and after quantitation, only dkf-2(−/−) exhibited significant differences in total TDP-43 levels. cdc-7(−/−) has been previously characterized as a TDP-43 kinase <[23]>, but we are including analysis of its mutant phenotypes in <Fig. 1> for comparison with H05L14.1(−/−) and dkf-2(−/−). rhetorical Figure 1 (A) Developmentally synchronized day 1 adult dkf-2(−/−);TDP-43, cdc-7(−/−);TDP-43, and H05L14.1(−/−);TDP-43 kinase mutants have decreased phosphorylated TDP-43 relative to TDP-43 transgenic animals alone.

PMC4256087_2,"We have assembled an RNAi library targeting 451 predicted kinase genes in C  elegans (95% coverage of the predicted kinases found in the C. elegans genome, Table S1). This library has been previously employed to identify kinase modifiers of TDP-43 dependent behavioral phenotypes, and identified CDC7 as a direct TDP-43 kinase responsible for promoting TDP-43 neurotoxicity <[23]>.

In fact, we observe that the cdc-7(−/−);TDP-43, H05L14.1(−/−);TDP-43 or dkf-2(−/−);TDP-43 had a more natural and vigorous movement profile relative to the TDP-43 transgene alone. We assessed motor function by measuring the average dispersal velocity of the animals, and found significant improvements compared to TDP-43 (<Fig. 1D>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation at S409/410 promotes TDP-43 toxicity, and decreased phosphorylation of TDP-43 will ameliorate the deleterious motor effects resulting from pathological TDP-43. To identify human homologs of H05L14.1 and dkf-2, we performed an unbiased search for related proteins from eukaryotes within the phylum chordata, including all vertebrate animals. This search employed a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) <[26]>, followed by automated construction of a phylogenetic tree with the top 50 hits from the search (<S3A Figure>) <[27]>. H05L14.1 is related to the human kinase TTBK1, although it is one of many members from an expanded family in C. elegans and other ecdysozoa. The H05L14.1 kinase domain has 40% sequence identity to the highly homologous tau tubulin kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2 at the amino acid level (<S3C, D Figure>) <[28]>. Variants in the gene coding for TTBK1 are associated with Alzheimer's disease, while mutation in TTBK2 causes spinocerebellar ataxia 11 (SCA11), both of which are characterized by pathologic alterations of tau <[26]>–<[28]>. dkf-2 is related to the conserved protein kinase D family, and is the major representative of the family in C. elegans (<S3B Figure>). The dkf-2 kinase domain has greater than 70% sequence identity to protein kinase D2 and D3 (PRKD2 and PRKD3) (<S3E, F Figure>). PRKD2/3 may be involved in cell proliferation, and dkf-2 has been shown to regulate C. elegans innate immunity (<Table 1>) <[29]>, <[30]>. Interestingly, our previous search for TDP-43 kinases identified another C. elegans homolog of TTBK1/2 <[23]>. This kinase, C55B7.10 also decreased TDP-43 phosphorylation and improved locomotion in C. elegans, although we were unable to determine a direct relationship between human TTBK1/2 and TDP-43 at that time. However, since our last study, we learned TTBK1/2 require millimolar levels of bivalent metal ions Mg2+ or Mn2+ in the reaction buffer for effective kinase activation <[31]>. We changed our in vitro kinase assay buffer composition, optimizing the reaction conditions for TTBK1/2 kinase assays. The quality of purified TTBK1/2 kinases also affects their activity in vitro. We compared purified TTBK1/2 from different commercial sources side by side in an in vitro kinase assay against a known target, tau, and found major differences in kinase activity (<S4A Figure>). Our previous characterization of TTBK1/2 as potential TDP-43 kinases used commercially available purified kinase with low activity against tau. Switching to a more active kinase preparation and modifying the buffer composition in the assay allowed a re-assessment of these potential TDP-43 kinases in vitro. TDP-43 kinases may act directly by phosphorylating TDP-43 S409/410 or may act indirectly by regulating the activity of other direct TDP-43 kinases. The amino acid sequence in the C-terminus of TDP-43 near S409/410 is consistent with the known CK1 family kinase consensus sequence S/TpXXS/T <[32]>. The PRKD kinase consensus sequence LXRXMSXXSFX <[33]>, does not conform well with the sequence of human TDP-43. To empirically determine whether human TTBK1/2 or PRKD2/3 are direct TDP-43 kinases, we tested the ability of purified active kinase enzymes to phosphorylate TDP-43 at S409/410 and S403/404 in vitro (<Fig. 1E, F>, <S4B Figure>). We found that TTBK1 and 2 can directly phosphorylate both wild-type (WT) and familial ALS mutant TDP-43 (M337V TDP-43) under optimized reaction conditions that include magnesium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4256087_3,"These conditions support robust phosphorylation of human tau protein, a known substrate of TTBK1/2 (<S4A Figure>, <[31]>)  Although our preparation of PRKD2 kinase was enzymatically active against a known phosphorylation substrate, histone H1 <[34]> (<S4C Figure>), PRKD2 was unable to phosphorylate TDP-43 under any conditions tested, indicating its effect on TDP-43 phosphorylation may be indirect through the activation of other direct TDP-43 kinases or regulation of other downstream members of a TDP-43 regulatory pathway. If the kinases CDC7, TTBK1/2, or PRKD2/3 are in a common regulatory pathway, they may directly phosphorylate one another. Using an in vitro kinase assay with purified human kinases, we observed robust auto-phosphorylation by TTBK1 and modest auto-phosphorylation by TTBK2 and PRKD2, consistent with known activities of these kinases <[28]>, <[31]>, <[34]>. We also tested pairwise combinations of these kinases to determine any relative increases in phosphorylation. However, we did not see any significant increases in phosphorylation on these kinases (<S4D Figure>). Therefore, any indirect regulation of TDP-43 phosphorylation by PRKD2 may be through other unknown members of one or several regulatory pathways controlling TDP-43 phosphorylation. TTBK1/2 kinase hyperactivity may contribute to the pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 observed in both FTLD-TDP and ALS. To test whether increased cellular levels of TTBK1/2 activity suffice to drive TDP-43 phosphorylation, we transfected full-length TTBK1 and TTBK2 cDNAs into HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells have some neuronal characteristics and may be derived from a subpopulation of neuronal precursor cells in the embryonic kidney <[35]>. This cell line is especially useful for biochemical assays requiring high efficiency transfection rates. In the absence of other cellular stresses, we observed robust induction of TDP-43 phosphorylation by immunoblot following transfection with both TTBK1 and TTBK2 (<Fig. 2A–C>). Likewise, we utilized SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma-derived cell line, to determine the location of phosphorylated TDP-43 produced by TTBK2 transfection. The phospho-TDP-43 produced by TTBK2 overexpression is localized throughout the cytoplasm overlapping with TTBK2 (<Fig. 2D, E>). Further, TTBK2 and phospho-TDP-43 appear concentrated in apparent aggregates, producing a pattern of TDP-43 and TTBK1/2 expression reminiscent of the neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion pathology observed in FTLD-TDP and ALS. SH-SY5Y cells are relatively recalcitrant to transfection; we observed less than 5% transfection efficiency with TTBK2. However, all the cells with strong TTBK2::GFP expression also had inclusions of phosphorylated TDP-43. We observed a similar pattern of TTBK2 transfection overlapping with large phospho-TDP-43 positive aggregates in HEK293 cells (<S5 Figure>). rhetorical Figure 2 (A) Overexpression of TTBK1 and TTBK2 in HEK293 cells induces robust TDP-43 phosphorylation in the absence of other cellular stressors.

FTLD cases were scored according to the harmonized FTLD-TDP classification of pathology <[40]>. Three of these cases were classified as Type A and three were Type B. All ALS cases were sporadic incidences of disease, and were negative for mutations in TDP-43, SOD1, FUS, and C9ORF72. TTBK1/2 antibody specificity was confirmed against purified substrate, and by antibody competition on fixed tissue (<S7 Figure>). <Fig. 4A–D> demonstrates that TTBK1 and TTBK2 immunoreactivity is present in a subset of pyramidal neurons in the frontal cortex of both normal and FTLD cases. Immunoreactivity is more prominent in cortical layers II–VI compared to cortical layer I, where immunoreactivity is relatively sparse, and the cellular localization appears both nuclear and cytoplasmic (<Fig. 4>, insets). Furthermore, the distribution of TTBK1 and TTBK2 immunoreactivity appears to be more widespread in FTLD cases compared to normal controls. Optical density measurements relative to the proportional area for TTBK1 and TTBK2 immunostaining in frontal cortex confirmed a statistically significant increase in both TTBK1 (<Fig. 4E>) and TTBK2 (<Fig. 4F>) immunoreactive distribution in disease-affected subjects. This increase was observed in all FTLD cases surveyed relative to controls. Importantly, the distribution of TTBK1 and TTBK2 in the frontal cortex is consistent with the distribution of phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology in FTLD cases, where aggregates are sparse in cortical layer I, and more abundant in cortical layers II–VI, depending on the FTLD classification (<Fig. 4G>). To further demonstrate this relationship, we performed double label immunohistochemistry to determine if the tau tubulin kinases and phosphorylated TDP-43 co-expressed within the same neurons. Most neurons immunoreactive for phospho-TDP-43 were also immunoreactive for TTBK1 and TTBK2 (<Fig. 4H, I>).Of the six ALS cases examined, only two had phospho-TDP-43 aggregates in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, while all six demonstrated phospho-TDP-43 aggregates within spinal cord. ALS spinal cord motor neurons immunoreactive for phospho-TDP-43 pathology also co-labeled with TTBK1 and TTBK2 (<Fig. 5A, B>). Of the two ALS cases with pathologic changes in brain, a subset of neurons in the hippocampus and frontal cortex containing phospho-TDP-43 aggregates also co-expressed TTBK1 and TTBK2, while other neurons appeared to be immunoreactive for phospho-TDP-43 alone (<Fig. 5 C–H>). To test whether TTBK1/2 co-localize with phosphorylated TDP-43, we performed double-label immunofluorescence on ALS spinal cord sections (<Fig. 6> and <S8 Figure>). In general, more neurons were immunofluorescent for TTBK1/2 than for phosphorylated TDP-43. Similar to our double label immunohistochemical data, neurons immunofluorescent for phosphorylated TDP-43 usually co-localized with TTBK1/2, although some neurons labeled with phosphorylated TDP-43 alone. Taken together <Figs. 4>, <5> and <6> repeatedly demonstrate an overlapping expression pattern for TTBK1/2 and pS409/410 TDP-43 inclusions in ALS and FTLD-TDP consistent with TTBK1/2 participation in the genesis of TDP-43 lesions. rhetorical Figure 6 Double-label immunofluorescence of ALS spinal cord of (A) TTBK1 and (B) TTBK2 show significant co-localization of TTBK1/2 with phospho-TDP-43 within neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Significance was determined using Pearson coefficient of colocalization. Both TTBK1 and TTBK2 are expressed in the brain, although TTBK2 is expressed in other tissues as well <[31]>, . If TTBK1 or TTBK2 promote TDP-43 phosphorylation in patients with ALS or FTLD, there may be alterations in kinase abundance or localization, and there should be co-occurrence of the kinase with pathological TDP-43 aggregates. Immunohistochemistry for TTBK1, TTBK2 and phospho-TDP-43 was performed on frontal cortex sections from 6 FTLD-TDP cases, 6 ALS cases and 6 normal control cases to determine if there was overlap in the expression of these kinases and their purported target.

This increase was observed in all FTLD cases surveyed relative to controls. Importantly, the distribution of TTBK1 and TTBK2 in the frontal cortex is consistent with the distribution of phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology in FTLD cases, where aggregates are sparse in cortical layer I, and more abundant in cortical layers II–VI, depending on the FTLD classification (<Fig. 4G>). To further demonstrate this relationship, we performed double label immunohistochemistry to determine if the tau tubulin kinases and phosphorylated TDP-43 co-expressed within the same neurons.

PMC4256087_6,"To test whether TTBK1/2 co-localize with phosphorylated TDP-43, we performed double-label immunofluorescence on ALS spinal cord sections (<Fig  6> and <S8 Figure>). In general, more neurons were immunofluorescent for TTBK1/2 than for phosphorylated TDP-43. Similar to our double label immunohistochemical data, neurons immunofluorescent for phosphorylated TDP-43 usually co-localized with TTBK1/2, although some neurons labeled with phosphorylated TDP-43 alone. Taken together <Figs. 4>, <5> and <6> repeatedly demonstrate an overlapping expression pattern for TTBK1/2 and pS409/410 TDP-43 inclusions in ALS and FTLD-TDP consistent with TTBK1/2 participation in the genesis of TDP-43 lesions. Tandem phosphorylation at TDP-43 serines 409 and 410 (pS409/410) is a consistent and robust feature of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD-TDP. Our previous work in TDP-43 transgenic C. elegans demonstrated a causal relationship between neurodegeneration and S409/410 phosphorylation of TDP-43 <[14]>, <[23]>. We have utilized this model as a C. elegans behavior-based screening tool to identify TDP-43 kinases <[23]>. However, it is possible other relevant TDP-43 kinases remain unidentified. To uncover kinases responsible for the pathological phosphorylation of TDP-43, we have re-screened the C. elegans kinome by RNAi knockdown for modifiers of TDP-43 phosphorylation. For this survey we employed sensitive and specific S409/410 phosphorylation dependent TDP-43 antibodies <[41]> to directly detect changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation state following RNAi treatment. Confirmation of identified candidate kinases in C. elegans was conducted by testing deletion mutations within the kinase genes of interest. Three identified candidate kinases, cdc-7, dkf-2, and H05L14.1, reduced TDP-43 S409/410 phosphorylation and improved TDP-43 dependent behavioral phenotypes in C. elegans. TDP-43 is a known substrate of CDC7, as it was previously uncovered in a reverse genetic screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 behavioral phenotypes <[23]>, confirming the validity of this approach. We employed standard BLAST protein sequence homology searching algorithms <[42]> to identify the closest mammalian homologs of our novel TDP-43 kinases dkf-2 and H05L14.1. Interestingly, H05L14.1 was a homolog of the mammalian tau tubulin kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2. Our previous behavior-based screen for TDP-43 kinases identified a different C. elegans homolog of TTBK1/2 as a TDP-43 kinase, although at the time we were unable to demonstrate a direct relationship between human TTBK1/2 and TDP-43 <[23]>. We decided to re-evaluate TTBK1/2 as we had identified both as candidate kinases in independent assays. Using optimized in vitro kinase reaction conditions, we demonstrate here that human TTBK1/2 are able to directly phosphorylate TDP-43. We then overexpressed TTBK1/2 in cultured human cells. TTBK1/2 overexpression in the absence of other stressors promoted robust phosphorylation of endogenous TDP-43. Furthermore, this phosphorylated TDP-43 localized to the cytoplasm in inclusion-like aggregates. We also found that reduction of TTBK1 mRNA levels attenuated TDP-43 phosphorylation in a chemically induced model of pathological phospho-TDP-43 accumulation. Finally, to explore whether TDP-43 kinase hyperactivity could underlie the etiology of TDP-43 proteinopathies, we immunostained tissue from FTLD-TDP and ALS for TTBK1/2. We observe increased TTBK1/2 in FTLD-TDP frontal cortex, and co-localization with TDP-43 positive aggregates in FTLD frontal cortex and ALS spinal cord. One possible explanation for these data is the observed differences in TTBK1/2 expression drives neurodegeneration in TDP-43 proteinopathies. Taken together these data support a pivotal role for TTBK1/2 hyperactivity in TDP-43 proteinopathy.A number of kinases have been identified to date with the ability to phosphorylate TDP-43 in vitro and in vivo. The kinases CK1 <[43]>, <[44]>, CKII <[45]>, CDC7 (<[23]>, this study), TTBK1 and TTBK2 (this study) may all contribute to pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation in humans; regardless they all share target sequence conservation as the CK1 kinase domain is the prototypical model for this family of kinases. CK1 family kinases may act redundantly to regulate TDP-43 phosphorylation in a common signaling pathway. Alternatively, extracellular and intracellular signals may act as a trigger to specify kinase activity from one of the available TDP-43 kinases but not the others. We have observed that in the absence of each of these known TDP-43 kinases in C. elegans, mutant TDP-43 still exhibits varying but detectable degrees of phosphorylation (<Fig. 1> and <[23]>), indicating that no one kinase accounts for all observed TDP-43 phosphorylation. Exploring the functional relationships between and regulatory networks governing the TDP-43 kinases identified to date will be important future work.TTBK1 and TTBK2 were originally purified on the basis of their kinase activity on the microtubule binding protein tau at several pathological phospho-tau epitopes known to accumulate in Alzheimer's disease <[31]>, <[38]>, <[39]>, <[46]>. Tangles composed of insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as a number of other neurodegenerative diseases including FTLD-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Interestingly, phosphorylated TDP-43 is also present in a subset of patients with primary tauopathies such as AD, PSP, and CTE <[8]>, <[47]>, <[48]>, and either tau or TDP-43 are the diagnostic pathologic changes in the vast majority of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases <[49]>. The relationship between TDP-43 and tau neuropathologic changes remains unclear. One hypothesis is that both proteinopathy disorders share a common etiology in TTBK1/2 activation leading to either TDP-43 or tau neuropathology depending on the vulnerable cell population affected by TTBK activation. The downstream toxic mechanisms for tau and TDP-43 appear distinct; however, inappropriate TTBK1 and TTBK2 activity may constitute a shared mechanistic link in initiating both tau and TDP-43 neuropathologies.Both TTBK1 and TTBK2 have been previously implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TTBK1 are associated with decreased Alzheimer's disease risk in studies of Spanish and Han Chinese populations <[50]>, <[51]>. TTBK1 has been shown to co-localize with diffuse phospho-Ser422 tau in pre-tangle Alzheimer's disease neurons <[52]>, and increased levels of TTBK1 have been observed in AD frontal cortex <[53]> and enhance the toxicity of tau in a P301L mouse model <[54]>. Mutations in TTBK2 have been shown to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) <[55]>, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tau pathology. Mouse models heterozygous for mutant TTBK2 exhibit decreased TTBK2 kinase activity and altered TTBK2 localization, while homozygous mutant TTBK2 is embryonic lethal <[56]>. Our results are the first demonstration of a potential role for TTBK1 and TTBK2 in primary TDP-43 proteinopathies.Kinases regulating TDP-43 phosphorylation present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in both ALS and FTLD-TDP. No specific small molecule inhibitors targeting TTBK1 or TTBK2 has been reported to date, despite their potential roles contributing to tauopathies by hyperphosphorylating tau. Development of brain penetrant TTBK1 and TTBK2 inhibitors may also provide a viable strategy for intervening in TDP-43 proteinopathy disorders including ALS and FTLD-TDP. N2 (Bristol) was used as wild type C. elegans and maintained as previously described <[57]>. Strains were maintained at 16°C.

The list of predicted kinase genes in C. elegans was derived from the C. elegans kinome project <[58]>, with library construction as described <[23]>. Testing was done in an eri-1(−/−);lin-15(−/−) RNAi enhancing mutant background <[59]>. Staged embryos were plated, grown at 16°C for 8–9 days, and then a mixed population of 1st generation gravid adults with 2nd generation L2–L3 animals were harvested by washing with M9 buffer into 96 well plates and frozen at −80°C, for subsequent immunoblot analysis. Each RNAi treated population was evaluated semi-quantitatively for reduction in phospho-TDP-43 relative to control treated animals. Positives candidates were retested for effects on TDP-43 phosphorylation by independent RNAi treatment and immunoblot, and the RNAi gene target for each plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. Equivalent mixed-stage worm lysate fractions were loaded and resolved on precast 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). On immunoblots, human TDP-43 was detected with a commercially available monoclonal antibody ab57105 (Abcam) directed against human TDP-43 amino acids 1–261. TDP-43 phosphorylated at S409/S410 was detected by a monoclonal antibody called anti phospho TDP-43 (pS409/410) available from Cosmobio (catalog # TIP-PTD-M01). C. elegans β-tubulin levels were measured using monoclonal antibody E7 as a loading control as previously described <[60]>, <[61]>. TTBK1 was detected by Abcam rabbit polyclonal antibody ab103944 at 1∶1000 dilution. TTBK2 was detected by Abgent rabbit polyclonal antibody AP12162a at 1∶1000 dilution. HRP labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) and used at a dilution of 1∶4000. Dilutions were: 1∶7500 for ab57105, 1∶1000 for pS409/410, and 1∶10000 for E7. Immunoblots shown are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. Quantitation was performed using ImageJ image processing and analysis software. GST-TDP-43 (WT) and GST-TDP-43 (M337V) fusion proteins were purified from BL21 (DE3) expression host cells as previously described <[62]>. Active kinase enzymes were obtained commercially via purification from SF9 cells for PRKD2, TTBK1 and TTBK2 (Signalchem). Enzyme assays were carried out in a kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mM MOPS, 12.25 mM glycerol-phosphate, 25 mM MgCl, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT and 50 µM ATP. HEK 293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% defined fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (50 IU/ml)–streptomycin (50 mg/ml). NSC-34 cells (Cedarlane Labs) and SHSY-5Y cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM/HAM's F12 (50/50) with 10% FBS and penicillin (50 IU/ml)–streptomycin (50 mg/ml). Cells were seeded onto poly-D-Lysine coated (Sigma Aldrich) 12 mm round glass cover slips in 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding TTBK2-GFP with GenePorter 2 (Genlantis) using the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed for imaging in 4% formaldehyde 96 hours after transfection. Cells were washed 3×5 min in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, then blocked in antibody buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% NaN2)+10% normal goat serum. Primary antibody was applied and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (Cosmo Bio; 1∶1000). Cells were washed 3×5 min in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, then re-blocked for 10 min. Appropriate secondary antibody was applied and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed 3×5 min in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, counterstained with 300 nM DAPI and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade. Microscopy was performed on a Delta Vision microscope (Applied Precision, Inc) using a 60× oil immersion objective, a sCMOS camera, and 2×2 binning. Image analysis was performed using softWoRx 6.0 Beta software. HEK 293 cells were treated with 150 µM ethacrynic acid (EA) for 5 hours to induce endogenous TDP-43 phosphorylation <[36]>. NSC-34 cells were grown in differentiation medium (DMEM/HAM's F12 (50/50), 1% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA), penicillin (50 IU/ml)–streptomycin (50 mg/ml)) for one day prior to treatment with 50 µM EA for 5 hours. TTBK1 siRNA construct was MMC.RNAI.N001162864.12.1 (Integrated DNA Technologies).

Transfection of plasmids containing full-length TTBK1 (pWO:TTBK1) and TTBK2 (TTBK2 GFP pFLAP dest) sequences <[63]> was performed as specified by the manufacturer using the Geneporter 2 Transfection Reagent (Genlantis). RNA was purified from flash-frozen cell pellets using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was made using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed on an 7900HT Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). De-identified post-mortem brain tissue used in this study was determined to be an exempt from IRB review by the VA Puget Sound Health Care System Human Research Protection Program Director on December 29, 2011. Tissue used for these studies was obtained from the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank (Seattle, WA), and the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center brain bank(Indianapolis, IN), where consent for autopsy and permission for use of tissue in scientific experiments was obtained. FTLD and ALS cases were selected on the basis of having an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of FTLD and FTLD-related disorders or ALS. Control samples were from de-identified neurologically healthy control participants, who were of a similar age. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were anti-TTBK1 (Abcam, 1∶100), anti-TTBK2 (Abgent, 1∶200), and anti-phospho TDP-43 409/410 (CosmoBio, 1∶1000)). In order to minimize variability, sections from all cases (normal and affected subjects) were stained simultaneously for each antibody. Immunostained sections were analyzed using the computerized image analysis system, MicroComputer Imaging Device (MCID, Imaging Research, St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada). Blinded assessment of optical density measurements were obtained relative to the proportional area for TTBK1 and TTBK2 immunostaining in frontal cortex grey matter (three separate readings per case). Data were averaged and are represented as mean +/− SEM. A two tailed Student's t-test was used to assess differences in TTBK1 and TTBK2 expression between cases and controls. For double label immunohistochemistry experiments, sections were first immunostained with anti-phospho TDP-43 and reaction product was visualized with nickel enhanced DAB (black). Sections were then immunostained with anti-TTBK1 or TTBK2 and visualized with DAB alone (brown). For double label immunofluorescence experiments, AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and AlexaFluor 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used and autofluoresence was quenched with 0.1% Sudan Black <[64]>. To demonstrate specificity of the TTBK antibodies, TTBK1 and TTBK2 were blocked with 50-fold amount of immunizing peptide overnight at 4°C before proceeding with the immunostaining protocol (see <S5 Figure>). Pathological aggregates of phosphorylated TDP-43 characterize amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), two devastating groups of neurodegenerative disease. Kinase hyperactivity may be a consistent feature of ALS and FTLD-TDP, as phosphorylated TDP-43 is not observed in the absence of neurodegeneration. By examining changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation state, we have identified kinases controlling TDP-43 phosphorylation in a C. elegans model of ALS. In this kinome-wide survey, we identified homologs of the tau tubulin kinases 1 and 2 (TTBK1 and TTBK2), which were also identified in a prior screen for kinase modifiers of TDP-43 behavioral phenotypes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4256087_8,"Using refined methodology, we demonstrate TTBK1 and TTBK2 directly phosphorylate TDP-43 in vitro and promote TDP-43 phosphorylation in mammalian cultured cells  TTBK1/2 overexpression drives phosphorylation and relocalization of TDP-43 from the nucleus to cytoplasmic inclusions reminiscent of neuropathologic changes in disease states. Furthermore, protein levels of TTBK1 and TTBK2 are increased in frontal cortex of FTLD-TDP patients, and TTBK1 and TTBK2 co-localize with TDP-43 inclusions in ALS spinal cord. These kinases may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention for TDP-43 proteinopathies such as ALS and FTLD-TDP. Aggregated proteins are a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. In ALS and FTLD-TDP, these aggregates contain abnormal TDP-43 modified by phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation normally controls protein activity, stability, or location, but in some neurodegenerative diseases the phosphorylated proteins accumulate in excess. Kinases are the enzymes responsible for protein phosphorylation. We have identified two TDP-43 kinases, TTBK1 and TTBK2, using a novel approach combining reverse genetics and biochemical screening to identify the kinases responsible for changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation. We show TTBK1 and TTBK2 directly phosphorylate TDP-43 in vitro, and control TDP-43 phosphorylation in cellular and simple animal models of ALS. This has uncovered a molecular mechanism by which pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 can occur in disease. To determine whether changes in TTBK1/2 protein are contributing to TDP-43 pathology, we examined diseased brain and spinal cord tissue from patients with ALS or FTLD-TDP. We observed changes in the abundance of TTBK1 and TTBK2 in disease-affected neurons, and the coexistence of TTBK1/2 with phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates in both FTLD-TDP and ALS. Therefore, increased abundance or activity of TTBK1 or TTBK2 may contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in ALS and FTLD-TDP. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4787271_0,"The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) degrades misfolded proteins including those implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the effects of tau accumulation on proteasome function in a mouse model of tauopathy and in a cross to a UPS reporter mouse (line Ub-G76V-GFP). Accumulation of insoluble tau was associated with a decrease in the peptidase activity of brain 26S proteasomes, higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins and undegraded Ub-G76V-GFP. 26S proteasomes from mice with tauopathy were physically associated with tau and were less active in hydrolyzing ubiquitinated proteins, small peptides and ATP. 26S proteasomes from normal mice incubated with recombinant oligomers or fibrils also showed lower hydrolyzing capacity in the same assays, implicating tau as a proteotoxin. Administration of an agent that activates cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling led to attenuation of proteasome dysfunction, probably through proteasome subunit phosphorylation. In vivo, this led to lower levels of aggregated tau and improvements in cognitive performance. We thank J. Lewis and K. Ashe for providing rtg4510 and JNPL3 mice and P. Davies for the generous gift of tau antibodies. We thank L. Liu for assisting with mice perfusion. This work was supported by grants from the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NS074593 (K.E.D.), curePSP Foundation (N.M.), the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences GM051923 (to A.L.G.), the Fidelity Biosciences Research Initiative (A.L.G.) and the multiple myeloma Research Foundation (N.V.K.). The UPS is the major pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells<1>. Proteins are covalently tagged by the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain leading to rapid binding and hydrolysis by the 26S proteasome. This large (66-subunit) ATP-dependent proteolytic complex binds ubiquitinated proteins via receptor subunits on its 19S regulatory particle and then the ATPase complexes unfold and translocate the polypeptides into the 20S core particle where they are digested to small peptides by its six peptidase sites<2>–<4>. The proteasome’s ability to hydrolyze short peptides can be stimulated by agents that cause cAMP accumulation or by treatment with pure protein kinase A (PKA)<5>–<7>. The accumulation of ubiquitinated protein inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases<8> suggests that defects exist in 26S proteasome-mediated clearance in affected neurons, and in support of this, tau from people with Alzheimer’s disease has been shown to be polyubiquitinated at several sites<9>–<11> and several studies have implicated UPS dysfunction in response to tauopathy<12>–<17>. Herein, we demonstrate that pharmacological agents that raise cAMP in the brain and activate PKA can phosphorylate proteasome subunits, enhance proteasome activity, promote clearance of abnormal tau and improve cognition. We first investigated the impact of progressive tauopathy on the UPS in the rTg4510 mouse, which expresses a pathogenic tau mutation (P301L) and exhibits progressive neurofibrillary pathology, neuronal loss and cognitive deficits<18>. At 3–4 months, these mice model early-stage disease; by 8 months they resemble a more severe stage of the human disease. By 5 months, soluble tau migrating at ~55 kDa converts to a disease-associated, hyperphosphorylated insoluble tau species that migrates at ~64 kDa (<Fig. 1a>). The ratio of 64-kDa to 55-kDa tau bands in cortical tissue (here referred to as the 64/55-kDa tau ratio) can be used to indicate the tauopathy stage of these mice. We observed the greatest change in the 64/55-kDa tau ratio in mice between 3 and 5 months of age, when the ratio increased fivefold. By 8 months, the 64/55 kDa tau ratio had increased further. Examination of additional time points (<Supplementary Fig. 1a,b>) identified 3.5–4.5 months as the time at which 64-kDa tau first began to accumulate. The shift to 64-kDa forms coincided with an increase in the amount of sarkosyl-insoluble total and phosphorylated tau, a concomitant decrease in soluble (heat-stable) tau (<Fig. 1a> and <Supplementary Fig. 1c>) and accumulation of total ubiquitinated proteins (<Fig. 1a>). To assess whether worsening tauopathy impairs 26S proteasome function, we first measured the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasomes. In older mice with a higher 64/55-kDa tau ratio, peptidase activity in the cortical brain extracts decreased. The activity of both singly (1-cap) and doubly (2-cap) capped 26S proteasomes decreased under these assay conditions; the free 20S particles showed no activity (<Fig. 1b>). This decrease was not due to reduced 26S or 20S proteasome levels, as there was no change in the levels of the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit Rpt6 (<Fig. 1b>) or the 20S subunit (<Supplementary Fig. 2a>). Wild-type (WT) mice showed no decrease in 26S proteasome activity over this period (<Supplementary Fig. 2b>). To assay proteasome function more rigorously, we purified 26S proteasomes from mouse cortex by affinity chromatography using the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL)<19>. Purified proteasomes also showed a decrease in peptidase activity in mice between 3 and 5 months of age, coinciding with the period when levels of ~64 kDa tau increased. All three of the particle’s peptidase activities—chymotrypsin- (<Fig. 1c>), trypsin- and caspase-like activities (<Supplementary Fig. 2c,e>) decreased during this period. Peptidase activity of WT proteasomes was not affected up to 8 months of age (<Fig. 1d> and <Supplementary Fig. 2d,f>). Proteasomes from rTg4510 mice showed lower 26S peptidase activity than proteasomes from age-matched WT mice (<Supplementary Fig. 2g–i>) but no changes in 26S (2-cap and 1-cap) levels, as assessed by immunoblotting of native PAGE gel for the Rpt6 subunit (<Supplementary Fig. 2g>), indicating that the decrease in 26S peptidase activity was related to tauopathy. Ubiquitinated proteins are the primary substrates of 26S proteasomes in cells. Therefore, to obtain a more physiologically relevant measure of proteasome function in rTg4510 mice, we measured the degradation rates of two well-characterized substrates, ubiquitinated DHFR (Ub5-DHFR) and ubiquitinated Sic1 (Ubn-Sic1)<20>,<21>. Proteasomes from rTg4510 mice aged 5 and 8 months showed a reduced capacity to hydrolyze these ubiquitin conjugates, compared to proteasomes from 3-month-old rTg4510 or age-matched WT mice (<Fig. 1e> and <Supplementary Fig. 2j>). ATP hydrolysis by the six AAA+ ATPases of the 19S regulatory particles is crucial for substrate degradation<20>,<22>,<23>. To examine the function of ATPase subunits, we measured ATP hydrolysis<20>,<23> of purified proteasomes from WT and rTg4510 mice. Proteasomes from 8-month-old rTg4510 mice showed reduced ATP hydrolysis, as compared to age-matched WT proteasomes (<Fig. 1f>), but the difference between rTg4510 and WT was not significant at 3 months. To obtain additional evidence that worsening tauopathy is associated with proteasome dysfunction, we generated a transgenic mouse by crossing rTg4510 mice to a UPS reporter line expressing a 26S-targeted fragment fused to GFP<24>. Normally, the fusion protein is ubiquitinated and hydrolyzed rapidly by the 26S proteasome via the ubiquitin-fusion degradation (UFD) pathway<20>. GFP is therefore undetectable (or present at very low levels) in normal cells, but it is stabilized and accumulates when there are defects in the UPS. The transgenic (rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP) mice showed accumulation of GFP puncta, which increased with worsening tauopathy from 5 (<Fig. 1g>) to 8 months (<Fig. 1h>). In contrast, the brains of littermate mice expressing Ub-G76V-GFP but not mutant tau (Ub-G76V-GFP mice) accumulated very low amounts of GFP at both 5 (<Fig. 1g>) and 8 (<Fig. 1h>) months, although there was a slight (nonsignificant) increase with age. Quantitative analysis of GFP by immunohistochemistry (<Fig. 1i>) and immunoblotting (<Fig. 1j>) showed more GFP in rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice than in age-matched Ub-G76V-GFP controls. The GFP signal was often localized in the cell body and appeared to overlap with human tau, which is predominantly somatodendritic at 5–8 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4787271_1,"However, in the rTg4510:Ub:G76V-GFP mice, the intensity of tau staining resulting from the high level of tau expression made it difficult to observe GFP signal in the same cells  We therefore examined a second mouse line (JNPL3, which carry a human tau with a P301L mutation<25>, crossed to Ub-G76V-GFP mice). Hindbrain neurons from the resulting JNPL3:Ub-G76V-GFP mice showed colocalization of tau and GFP (<Supplementary Fig. 3>), probably owing to co-sequestration of aggregated tau and GFP into inclusion bodies. To confirm that the accumulation of tau aggregates and not soluble tau impairs proteasome function, we generated stable lines of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing WT tau or highly aggregable mutant tau. The cell lines expressed similar amounts of soluble tau, but the mutant line showed higher amounts of insoluble tau (<Fig. 2a>). The chymotrypsin-like activity of 26S proteasomes from tau mutant– expressing cells was lower than that in WT-expressing cells, which was not different from that in non-transfected, control cells (<Fig. 2b>). Protein aggregates that cause neurodegenerative diseases have been proposed to physically associate with proteasomes and interfere with substrate degradation<26>. Immunoprecipitation of human tau from cortical brain extracts of rTg4510 mice aged 3, 5 or 8 months (<Fig. 2c>) co-precipitated several proteasome subunits. To test whether aggregates of tau can directly cause proteasome dysfunction, we incubated proteasomes with recombinant monomeric tau or aggregates<27>. Incubation of 26S proteasomes from WT mice with low–molecular weight (LMW) oligomeric or fibrillar tau reduced peptidase activity, whereas incubation of 26S proteasomes with monomeric tau had no effect (<Fig. 2d>). To examine the effect of LMW forms of tau, we incubated recombinant tau for 8, 24 or 48 h and then incubated equivalent amounts of each oligomers preparation with purified proteasomes. Tau monomers had no effect, but oligomers incubated for 48 h impaired proteasome function significantly (<Fig. 2e>). PKA enhances proteasome peptidase activity<5>,<6>. Therefore, we tested whether raising levels of cAMP and activating PKA would stimulate proteasome activity ex vivo (<Fig. 3>) and in vivo (<Figs. 4> and <5>). Rolipram is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that increases cAMP levels in multiple tissues in vivo<28>. To assess whether activation of cAMP-PKA enhances proteasome function and reduces the accumulation of tau, we prepared cortical brain slices from rTg4510 mice aged 3–4 months (early-stage mice) and treated them with vehicle, dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), rolipram or epoxomicin (a specific inhibitor of the proteasome’s chymotrypsin-like activity). Exposure of slices from the early-stage mice to rolipram or db-cAMP for 8 h reduced amounts of total and insoluble tau (<Fig. 3a>), including phosphorylated tau (<Supplementary Fig. 4a,b>). In contrast, epoxomicin treatment increased levels of phosphorylated tau (<Supplementary Fig. 4>), although the amount of total tau remained unchanged (<Fig. 3a>). PKA is known to phosphorylate tau at Ser214 (pS214)<29>. We therefore monitored the amount of pS214 tau to determine whether rolipram and db-cAMP activated PKA. The amount of pS214 tau was higher in db-cAMP– and rolipram-treated samples than in control (DMSO) and epoxomicin-treated slices (<Fig. 3a>). The chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasomes in crude extracts was elevated after administration of db-cAMP or rolipram but was blocked by epoxomicin (<Fig. 3b>). To verify that these effects were mediated through enhancement of proteasomal activity and not some other effect of cAMP-PKA, we treated organotypic slices from early-stage rTg4510 mice with epoxomicin and db-cAMP or rolipram (<Fig. 3c>). Epoxomicin prevented the decrease in total and insoluble tau seen with db-cAMP and rolipram treatment alone. pS214 tau has been shown to reduce recombinant tau aggregation in vitro<30>,<31>. However, in acute organotypic slices, hyper phosphorylation of Ser214 by db-cAMP or rolipram occurred in the presence of epoxomicin but without a reduction in tau aggregates (<Fig. 3c>). To further confirm that the impact of enhanced PKA activity was on proteasome function and phosphorylation, we incubated purified 26S proteasomes from WT mouse brains with active PKA for 60 min and assayed their chymotrypsin-like activity. PKA treatment enhanced proteasome activity almost twofold (<Fig. 3d>). Proteasomes incubated with oligomeric tau showed a reduced rate of hydrolysis of the small fluorogenic peptide (<Fig. 3d>), but proteasomes pre-treated with PKA were protected from the inhibitory effect of tau oligomers, as the decrease in activity in PKA-treated proteasomes after the addition of oligomers was not statistically significant (<Fig. 3d>). WT proteasomes incubated with LMW oligomeric tau showed a reduced rate of hydrolysis of Ub5-DHFR (<Fig. 3e>) and a decrease in ATP hydrolysis (<Fig. 3f>), as compared to proteasomes without added oligomers. Pre-treatment of proteasomes with PKA enhanced degradation of Ub5-DHFR (<Fig. 3e>) and ATP hydrolysis (<Fig. 3f>) and protected against the inhibitory effect of oligomers on these activities (<Fig. 3e,f>). Thus PKA treatment appeared to protect proteasomes from the inhibitory effects of aggregated tau in vitro. PKA treatment led to an increase in phosphorylation of proteasome particles (<Fig. 3g>), supporting the idea that proteasome activation by PKA is mediated by phosphorylation of proteasome subunits. Analyses of the mechanisms involved in proteasome activation by PKA are presented in Lokireddy et al.<32> To test whether raising cAMP with rolipram could reduce tauopathy and cognitive impairment, we administered rolipram to rTg4510 and rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice. Rolipram treatment during early-stage tauopathy in rTg4510 mice reduced amounts of total (<Fig. 4a> and <Supplementary Fig. 5a>) and phosphorylated tau (<Fig. 4c,e> and <Supplementary Fig. 5b,c>) in both the crude extracts and the insoluble fraction. The soluble (heat-stable) tau species also decreased slightly but not significantly. Rolipram treatment increased the total amount of pS214 tau in the extracts, confirming that PKA activity was enhanced (<Supplementary Fig. 5d>). To assess whether rolipram treatment attenuated UPS deficits in vivo, we also treated rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice. Rolipram-treated rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice showed reduced immunofluorescence labeling of total and phosphorylated tau (<Fig. 4b,d,f>). Because tau aggregates were reduced, we also measured p62 protein, which associates with insoluble ubiquitinated proteins after proteasome inhibition<33>. Rolipram treatment significantly decreased p62 levels in rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining (<Fig. 4g>), and in rTg4510 mice, as assessed by quantitative immunoblotting (<Fig. 4h> and <Supplementary Fig. 5e>). GFP (an indicator of UPS dysfunction) was reduced as assessed by detection of fluorescence without antibody (<Fig. 5a> and <Supplementary Fig. 6a>) and by immunoblotting (<Fig. 5b>) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the cortex of rTg4510: Ub-G76V-GFP mice treated with rolipram. Age-matched control mice (Ub-G76V-GFP) showed no change in the amount of GFP between vehicle- and rolipram-treated animals, as assessed by immunoblotting (<Supplementary Fig. 6b>), and no accumulation of GFP puncta when analyzed by confocal microscopy for GFP signal (<Supplementary Fig. 6c>). These findings indicate that rolipram treatment improved UPS-mediated degradation in mice with tauopathy in vivo. In support of these findings, when 26S proteasomes from the brains of these mice were resolved by native PAGE, both doubly capped and singly capped 26S particles showed increased activity in rolipram-treated mice (<Fig. 5c> and <Supplementary Fig. 7a>). The levels of proteasome proteins were unchanged (<Supplementary Fig. 7b>). Purified proteasomes from rolipram-treated mice had increased chymotrypsin- (<Fig. 5d>), trypsin- and caspase-like activities (<Supplementary Fig.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4787271_2,"8a,b>), and the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was lower in extracts from rolipram-treated mice, consistent with enhanced proteasome activity (<Fig  5e> and <Supplementary Fig. 7c>).To assess whether the mechanism of enhanced serine and threonine phosphorylation of proteasome subunits could occur in rolipram-treated mice in vivo as observed in 26S proteasomes treated with purified PKA (<Fig. 3e>), we purified 26S particles from vehicle- (control) and rolipram-treated rTg4510 mouse brains and analyzed them by quantitative immunoblotting with an antibody to phosphorylated serines and threonines. Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine epitopes of several subunits was evident in the rolipram-treated group (<Fig. 5f>), without any change in protein levels of proteasomes (<Fig. 5g>).To assess whether rolipram treatment could protect proteasomes from tau-mediated inhibition, we isolated 26S proteasomes from rolipram-treated mice and incubated them with tau oligomers. Inhibition was not significant after rolipram-treated 26S proteasomes were incubated with tau oligomers (<Fig. 5h>), unlike the marked inhibition seen in proteasomes from untreated WT mice incubated with oligomers (<Fig. 3d>). Pre-incubation of proteasomes from rolipram-treated rTg4510 mice with PKA further increased proteasome phosphorylation (<Fig. 5i>), and peptidase activity was increased (<Fig. 5h>), suggesting that further activation was possible even in the presence of tau oligomers. cAMP-PKA signaling has been shown to suppress autophagy induction and autophagy-dependent neurite degeneration in primary neuronal cells bearing an LRRK2 mutation<34>. In our study, rolipram administration in rTg4510 mice had no effect on the levels of proteins associated with autophagic induction or on proteins responsible for elongation and maturation of the autophagosome (<Supplementary Fig. 9>). To assess the effect of rolipram on tauopathy-associated cognitive impairment, we examined spatial reference memory in rTg4510, rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP and WT mice in the Morris water maze. We observed a difference between WT and rTg4510 mice (genotype effect) and between treated and untreated (vehicle or rolipram) rTg4510 mice (treatment effect) on spatial learning over time (<Fig. 6> and <Supplementary Data>). Escape latency at day 3 was not different across treatment groups for any strains tested. However, by day 4 of testing, cognitive impairment was detectable in vehicle-treated rTg4510 mice but not in rolipram-treated rTg4510 mice or WT groups, and the performance of rolipram-treated rTg4510 mice did not differ from that of WT mice. Rolipram treatment had the same effect in rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice (data not shown). This effect could not be attributed to a general improvement in cognition or performance, as rolipram treatment had no effect on the performance of WT mice. Rolipram was not as effective at later stages of tauopathy (age 8–10 months in rTg4510 mice) as at 3–4 months, either ex vivo (<Supplementary Fig. 10>) or in vivo (<Supplementary Fig. 11>). In contrast to our observations in slices from early-stage mice, acute slices from cortex of mice with advanced tauopathy showed only a slight (not significant) decrease in total (<Supplementary Fig. 10a>) and phosphorylated (<Supplementary Fig. 10b,c>) tau levels after treatment with db-cAMP or rolipram. There was a trend toward increased proteasome activity upon exposure to db-cAMP or rolipram, but this was not statistically significant (<Supplementary Fig. 10d>), and activity was lower than that evoked in slices from early-stage brains. PKA activity (indicated by the level of pS214 tau) was increased after db-cAMP or rolipram treatment, but the change reached significance only after db-cAMP treatment (<Supplementary Fig. 10e>). In agreement with our findings ex vivo, rolipram administration in late-stage mice did not reduce the levels of total (<Supplementary Fig. 11a>) or phosphorylated tau (<Supplementary Fig. 11b,c>). The levels of ubiquitinated proteins were not significantly different in late-stage mice treated with vehicle and rolipram (<Supplementary Fig. 11e>). Furthermore, neither the activity of proteasomes nor the levels of proteasome proteins (<Supplementary Fig. 11f>) were significantly different. In vivo phosphorylation of 26S proteasome was lower in late-stage rolipram-treated rTg4510 mice than in early-stage, rolipram-treated mice (<Supplementary Fig. 11g>). Spatial learning was not improved in late-stage rTg4510 mice after rolipram treatment (<Supplementary Fig. 12a and Supplementary Data>). As PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB) has been shown to lead to memory improvement<35>, we wanted to assess whether CREB was phosphorylated by rolipram. We assessed the amount of phosphorylated and total CREB in tissue lysates from vehicle- and rolipram-treated rTg4510 mice, and found that phosphorylated CREB was increased in early- and late-stage rolipram-treated mice (<Supplementary Fig. 12b,c>). As we observed cognitive improvement only in rolipram-treated early-stage mice, it is unlikely that the activation of CREB signaling by cAMP-PKA accounted for the improved cognition. The degradation of ubiquitin conjugates by the 26S proteasome is coupled to ATP hydrolysis<36>, and ATP enhances multiple steps in this process, including conjugate binding, deubiquitination, substrate unfolding, gate opening in the 20S particle<22>,<37> and substrate trans-location into the 20S central chamber<21>. Protein aggregates, such as tau, that bind the 26S particle but resist dissociation or translocation through the ATPases, could disrupt this multistep process and obstruct the degradation of other proteins. In support of this, defects in proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins have been observed in the brains of mice infected with the prion protein PrPSc and microaggregates of PrPSc were shown to directly bind to 20S core particles and interfere with ATPase-induced gate opening for substrate entry<26>, leading to reduced hydrolysis of peptides, as we have shown for tau. It has generally been assumed that the rate-limiting step in the UPS is substrate ubiquitination and that the proteasome digests all ubiquitinated proteins that bind to it. However, recent findings indicate that many ubiquitinated proteins bind the proteasome but are released (or deubiquitinated and released) without degradation<2>,<36>,<38>. In proteotoxic diseases, a larger fraction of ubiquitin conjugates may fail to be digested. Similarly to a Huntington’s disease model<39>, PKA-mediated phosphorylation in the tauopathy model may enhance the fraction of ubiquitinated proteins that bind and are degraded<36>,<40>. Our in vitro studies showed that enhancement of proteasome activity by cAMP-PKA caused a rapid drop in ubiquitin conjugate levels, strongly suggesting that PKA-induced enhancement of conjugate degradation was responsible for the enhanced tau clearance. Thus, the rate of protein breakdown in cells appears to be regulated by proteasome phosphorylation and not just by substrate ubiquitination<32>. Of particular note in the present study was the ability of a pharmacological agent to promote proteasome activity, reduce tau and ameliorate disease-associated cognitive defects through cAMP-PKA signaling in mice during early-stage disease. However, short-term cAMP-PKA activation in mice at later stages of disease did not have the same effect. It is possible that this was a result of the short (3-week) exposure to rolipram or of suboptimal dosing of the mice, which have a very robust tauopathy phenotype. Alternatively, the form of tau cleared by the UPS might be the form involved in cell-to-cell propagation of tauopathy, and prevention of propagation of this form of tau by rolipram might be apparent only in a mouse model, where propagation of the disease can be quantified<41>,<42>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4787271_3,"We have shown that enhanced cAMP-PKA signaling in vivo leads to phosphorylation of several proteins in purified proteasomes leading to and that phosphorylation of critical proteasome subunits (particularly Rpn6) enhanced peptide and conjugate breakdown and ATPase function<32>  cAMP and PKA activate many other cellular processes, but enhancement of protein breakdown by phosphorylation of the proteasome is a new action for cAMP signaling. Together, these findings point to enhancement of proteasomal function through agents that phosphorylate proteasome subunits as a potentially promising therapeutic approach to treatment of proteotoxic diseases. Double-transgenic rTg4510<18> mice express human tau with four microtubule–binding domain repeats (4R0N) and the P301L mutation (line FVB-Tg(tetO-MAPT*P301L human)#Kha/JlwsJ) under the control of mouse calcium-calmodulin kinase II–driven tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTa) (line Tg(Camk2a-tTA).

JNPL3 mice express human 4R0N P301L mutation, and expression is driven by the mouse prion promoter Tg(Prnp-MAPT*P301L)JNPL3<25> strain of origin is FVB. Two novel transgenic crosses were generated. The triple-transgenic rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP crosses were obtained by cross-breeding rTg4510 with Ub-G76V-GFP. Resulting offspring were FVB:C57BL/6F1. Breeding was between one male rTg4510 and two female Ub-G76V-GFP mice, which we found resulted in the largest litters. The double-transgenic JNPL3:Ub-G76V-GFP mice were generated by cross-breeding JNPL3 and Ub-G76V-GFP mice; resulting offspring were FVB:C57BL/6 F1. Control mice were nontransgenic or Ub-G76V-GFP littermates. For time-course studies, male rTg4510 mice aged 3–8 months were used (n = 6 per age group). Male, early-stage (3–4 months old) and late-stage disease (8–10 months old) mice were used for ex vivo studies. For in vivo studies, rTg4510 and nontransgenic littermate males were used, as female mice from this line have more variability in tau expression. Studies with rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP mice and their control littermates (Ub-G76V-GFP) used male and female mice. Males from the double-transgenic cross JNPL3:Ub-G76V-GFP were used. No animal or extracted sample was excluded from any of the analyses. For the in vivo rolipram trials, mice from the same litters were randomly assigned to each experimental group (vehicle or rolipram). Drug administration and testing was performed in two sets of mice. Mice were housed in 12 h light–12 h dark cycles with free access to food and water. Rolipram (0.03 mg/kg) or DMSO (0.05%) in 0.9% normal saline solution was administered intraperitoneally twice daily for 21 days. Animal experiments were in full compliance with the US National Institutes of Health Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and overseen by Columbia University Medical Center.To assess whether rolipram could prevent overt tauopathy development or reverse it after pathology had already developed, rolipram was administered to mice at an early stage of the disease (3–4 months of age) or a late stage (8–10 months). As a control, WT and Ub-G76V-GFP mice (3–4 months old) were also administered rolipram. The mice were tested for cognitive performance in the Morris water maze 6 h after the final administration and immediately sacrificed. Proteasome activity and tauopathy were assessed in brain extracts. Western blots for all rTg4510 mice from two sets of administrations of 3–4 months of age and from 8–10 months are shown in <Supplementary Figures 5 and 9>, respectively. Investigators were blinded to mouse genotype during cognitive testing. Monoclonal antibodies to total human tau (CP27), pS396 and pS404 (PHF1) and pS202 and pT205 (CP13) were gifts from P. Davies. Polyclonal rabbit anti-pS214 tau was from Life Technologies (#44-742G); phospho-(Ser and Thr) PKA substrate (#9621), ULK1 (#4776), pS757 (#6888) and pS317 (#6887) ULK1, beclin 1 (#3788), Atg12 (#2010) were from Cell Signaling; anti-LC3 was from Novus Biological (NB600-1384); anti-GFP was from Abcam (#ab6556); rabbit anti-ubiquitin and rabbit anti-human tau were from Dako (Z0458 and A0024, respectively). Monoclonal mouse anti-CREB and phospho-S133 CREB (clone E306, #04-218 and clone 634-2, #05-807, respectively) were from Millipore; anti-GAPDH was from Sigma (clone GADH-71.1, #G8795); anti-p62 was from Abnova (clone 1C9, #H0000878-001); anti-Rpt6/S8 (clone EPR13565(B), #PW9265) and polyclonal rabbit anti-β5 (PW8895) were from BIOMOL; mono-clonal mouse anti-proteasome 20S (α1–α7) (clone MCP231, #BML-PW8195) was from Enzo. Anti-Rpn 1 (clone yC-19, #sc-26454), Rpn2 (clone 112-1,#sc-58007) and Rpn5 (clone N-12, #sc-107976) were from Santa Cruz. Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch, anti-mouse (115-035-003) and anti-rabbit (115-036-003). We prepared slice cultures using a method modified from Duff et al.<43>. Brains from rTg4510 mice at 3 and 8 months of age were harvested and hemispheres free of cerebellum and brainstem were sectioned into 350-µm-thick transverse slices and separated in ice-cold oxygenated Neurobasal A medium (Life Technologies). Slices were transferred to a 12-well plate connected to 95% O2/5% CO2 tank, containing 3.5 ml of Neurobasal A medium. Submerged slices were maintained for 8 h under continuous flow of 95% O2/5% CO2 (carbogen gas) at 37 °C bath temperature. We performed at least three biological experiments. For each experiment, hemispheres from two animals were randomly distributed in the wells, with each well containing 6–7 slices. Following a 15-min incubation, slices were treated with 2 mM db-cAMP (EMD Chemical), 20 µM rolipram, 500 nM epoxomicin (Sigma) or DMSO (final concentration of DMSO in the medium was 0.008%). In the co-treatment experiments, epoxomicin was added at the same time as db-cAMP and rolipram. Slices were collected and kept on dry ice until homogenization and protein extraction. HEK293 cell lines were mock transfected (transfected with an empty expression plasmid) or stably transfected with one of two tau constructs: human 4R WT tau or human 4R P301L and V331M mutant tau. Transfected cells were subject to kanamycin selection of tau-expressing cells for native PAGE assay and western blotting. Prior to conducting assays, we tested cells for mycoplasma by microbiological culture method, where cell culture supernatant is cultivated on a mycoplasma agar medium and incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks. Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml kanamycin and 1% nonessential amino acids. The Morris water maze test was carried out as previously described<44>. After nonspatial training, young (3–4 months of age) rTg4510 (15 rolipram- and 16 vehicle-treated mice, analyzed in two experiments) and age-matched WT mice (7 rolipram- and 7 vehicle-treated) underwent place-discrimination testing for 4 d with two trials per day. A second test was performed on rolipram- (n = 9) and vehicle-treated (n = 7) rTg4510 mice, aged 8–10 months, under identical conditions. Statistical methods were not employed to predetermine sample size; however, compared to other reported in vivo studies with transgenic animals, our studies included similar (old) or greater (young) numbers of animals. A third test was performed on young rTg4510:Ub-G76V-GFP (n = 8) and Ub-G76V-GFP (n = 5) mice. Sample sizes were smaller in this experiment owing to the complexity of generating a triple-transgenic cross. Mice from the same litter (4–5 mice per litter) were randomly assigned to each experimental group (vehicle or rolipram). Investigators carrying out tests were blinded to treatment group allocation and genotype. No animal was excluded from any of the analyses. We did not apply formal statistical tests for normality or equality of variances but assumed an approximation to the normal distribution when appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC4787271_4,"Statistical analyses for the Morris water maze test were done by repeated-measures ANOVA or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, as described below  Frozen brain tissues were processed for proteasome activity according to published methods<45>. Briefly, frozen tissue was homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol, which preserves 26S proteasome assembly, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 18 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was normalized for protein concentration. Samples were loaded on a 4% nondenaturing gel as described<45> and run for 200 min at 150 V. Activity of the 26S proteasome was measured by 400 µM Suc-LLVY-amc (BACHEM Bioscience) diluted in homogenizing buffer. 26S proteasome bands were detected by UV light (365 nm) and photographed by iPhone 4S camera. Following activity assessment, native gels were transferred for immunoblot analysis to detect proteasome levels using the anti-β5 (1:1,000) or anti-Rpt6 (1:1,000) antibody. At least three biological experiments were performed in HEK293 cell lines and acute slices (n = 6). For in vivo studies, proteasome activity was measured in extracts from young rTg4510 (15 rolipram- and 16 vehicle-treated mice, analyzed in two experiments) and from old rTg4510 (9 rolipram- and 7 vehicle-treated) mice. Samples (5–20 µg protein) were typically run on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies; WG1403BOX10) using MOPS buffer (NP0001) with antioxidant (NP0005) and on Tris-Glycine gels (EC64985BOX) for LC3. Proteins were analyzed after electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto 0.2-µm nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). Blots were blocked and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies at concentrations listed below. Membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Immobilon Western HRP substrate and Luminol reagent (WBKLS0500, Millipore) using a Fujifilm LAS3000 imaging system. ImageJ (http://rsb.info. nih.gov/ij) was used to quantify the signal. Relative intensity (fold change or fold increase, no units) is the ratio of the value for each protein to the value of the respective loading control. At least three biological experiments from two animals were performed in ex vivo and tauopathy in vivo studies. For in vivo study across tauopathy stages (<Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2b,g>) n = 6 mice were used. Dilutions for western blotting were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-tau (CP27, 1:5,000), pS396 and pS404 (PHF1, 1:5,000) and pS202 and pT205 (CP13,1:5,000). anti-pS214 tau (1:3,000); anti–phospho-(Ser and Thr) PKA substrate (1:1,000); anti-ULK1 (1:1,000), pS757 (1:1,000) and pS317 (1:1,000) ULK1; anti-Beclin 1 (1:1,000); anti-Atg12 (1:1,000); anti-CREB and phospho-S133 CREB (1:1,000); anti-LC3 (1:1,000); anti-GFP (1:1,000); anti-ubiquitin (1:1,500) anti-rabbit Tau (1:5,000); anti-GAPDH (1:5,000); anti-p62 (1:3,000); anti-proteasome, 19S regulatory particle: anti-Rpt6 (1:1,000) Rpn1 (1:500) and Rpn2 (1:500) and Rpn5 (1:500); 20S proteasome: β5 (1:1,000) and α1–α7 (1:1,000). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch: anti-mouse (1:3,000) and anti-rabbit (1:3,000) diluted in blocking buffer containing 5% milk. Mouse brains were isolated after transcardial perfusion with PBS and drop-fixed in 4% PFA overnight then subject to cryoprotection treatment in 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 h. Free-floating brain sections (35 µm) from brains sectioned in the sagittal plane were used. The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, #S-1000). Antibodies were as follows: anti-mouse monoclonal human tau (CP27,1:1,000); pS396 and pS404 (PHF1, 1:1,000); pS202 and pT205 (CP13,1:1,000); p62 (1:1,000). GFP signal was obtained without antibody staining. Following washes, sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific #A-11005, 1:500). Staining was visualized by confocal microscopy, FV1200 FluoView (FV) 1200 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus) and Zeiss AxioVision Imager Z1 microscope. Images were processed using FLUOVIEW software and AxioVision 4.8 image software. Quantification of the immunofluorescence signal for total and phosphorylated epitopes of tau, p62 and GFP signal was obtained by ImageJ. The immunoprecipitation assay was performed with the Pierce Crosslink IP kit as described by manufacturer’s protocol (#26147 Thermo Scientific). Briefly, 10 µg mouse monoclonal human tau (clone # CP27) or 10 µg Rpt6 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone EPR13565B) per sample was incubated with Pierce Protein A/G Plus agarose for 60 min, followed by cross-linking with DSS cross-linker reagent for 60 min. 500 µg protein in 400 µl immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Antigen elution was performed the next day. At least three independent experiments from two animals of each age group were performed (n = 6). Immunoprecipitation for tau and Rpt6 was performed with anti-mouse antibodies followed by immuno-blotting with anti-rabbit antibodies at the following dilutions: Rpt6 (1:1,000), Rpt5 (1:1,000), Rpn5 (1:500) and 20S (α1–α7) (1:1,000) and rabbit anti-human tau(1:3,000). Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit) were diluted at 1:3,000. The specificity of co-precipitation of proteasome subunits was confirmed, as other large complexes (for instance, ribosomes or mitochondria) were not co-precipitated with tau (data not shown). Preparation of tau aggregates from recombinant tau was performed as described<27>. Briefly, recombinant tau monomers were purchased from rPeptide (Tau-441, (2N4R) catalog #T-1001–2). Tau LMW aggregates were prepared by incubating tau solution (8 µM) at room temperature with 100 mM sodium acetate. Incubation times for LMW tau aggregates varied from 8 h to 2 d. For fibril assembly, tau solution (8 µM) was incubated with DTT (Invitrogen), heparin (Invitrogen), and sodium azide (0.02%), Invitrogen) for 5 d at room temperature, centrifuged at 14,000 × g and resuspended in 100 mM sodium acetate. Cortices from 6 mice were pooled each time proteasome purification was carried out, and 26S proteasomes were affinity purified using a UBL domain as the ligand<19>. Briefly, brain homogenates were spun for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The soluble extracts were incubated at 4 °C with 2 mg/ml glutathione-S-transferase–ubiquitin-like domain (GST-UBL) and a corresponding amount of glutathione–Sepharose 4B (GSH-Sepharose). The slurry containing 26S proteasomes bound to GST-UBL was poured into an empty column and washed, then incubated with 2 mg/ml His10-ubiquitin–interacting motif (10× His-UIM). The eluate was collected and incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose for 20 min at 4 °C. The Ni2+-NTA-bound 10× His-UIM was removed by filtration. The resulting flow-through (~0.6 mL) contained purified 26S proteasomes. The molarity of 26S proteasome particles was calculated assuming a molecular weight of 2.5 MDa. To assess peptidase capacity of 26S proteasome subunits, we incubated 10 nM of proteasome with 50 µM Suc-LLVY-amc fluorogenic peptide for chymotrypsin-like activity (β5 activity); 50 µM of Bz-VRG-amc (Bz-Val-Gly-Arg-amc) for trypsin-like activity (β2 activity); and 50 µM of Z-LLE-amc (Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-amc) for caspase-like activity (β1 activity). Kinetic reactions were carried out for a period of 90 min. The rate of kinetic reaction (slope) over time was calculated. Fluorescence signal was captured at 380 nm excitation, 460 nm emission by Infinite 200 PRO multimode reader (TECAN). Purified 26S proteasomes (10 nM) were incubated with 300 nM (13.8 ng/µL; MW, 45.92 kDa) recombinant tau. The assay was carried out in the presence of proteasome purification buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.01 mg/ml BSA. To measure chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes, 50 µM of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-amc was added to purified proteasomes and monomeric or aggregated recombinant tau mix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm the effect on proteasome activity, 26S proteasomes (10 nM) were pre-treated with 400 U (1 uL) catalytic subunit of PKA (New England BioLabs #P6000S) for 60 min at 30 °C. Activated proteasomes were then incubated with recombinant tau forms (300 nM or 13.8 ng/µL) and 50 µM Suc-LLVY-amc peptide, and the fluorescence monitored as described above. Ub5-DHFR (a gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals) was radiolabeled using PKA (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP<40>. Sic1PY was radiolabeled using casein kinase II and [γ-32P]ATP (NEB), followed by ubiquitination using Rsp5 as described previously (Ubn-Sic1)<46>. Degradation of these substrates (50 nM) by 26S proteasomes (1 nM) was assayed in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.01 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) as reported<47>,<48> and measured by after the conversion of the substrate to trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble 32P-labeled peptides. The reaction of 26S was carried out at 37 °C for 0, 10, 20 or 30 min with Ub5-DHFR and at 0, 3 or 9 min with Ubn-Sic1. ATPase function of 26S proteasomes subunits was performed using a malachite green system that detects the formation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) during ATP hydrolysis. The assay buffer contains 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 125 mM potassium acetate, 0.025% Triton X-100, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction with 5 nM of 26S proteasomes was carried out at 37 °C for 0, 20, 40 or 60 min. After incubation, samples were transferred to a 96-well plate on ice, and 170 µl malachite green hydrochloride/ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate solution (3:1) was added to the plate Immediately afterward, 20 µl 34% of citric acid was added to each well. Final concentration of the assay solution was 6 mM ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, 120 µM malachite green hydrochloride and 3.4% sodium citrate. Incubation at room temperature for 30 min is required for color development. The absorbance was read at 650 nm by infinite 200 PRO multimode reader (TECAN). The amount of Pi released was calculated on the basis of the absorbance standard curve established by KH2PO4. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the brains were immediately dissected on wet ice and stored on dry ice. Briefly, frozen hemispheres free of cerebellum and brainstem were weighed and homogenized without thawing in RIPA buffer (10× volume/weight) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl (PMSF), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride (NaF), 1 µl/ml protease inhibitor mix (Sigma-Aldrich)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein assay was performed on the clear supernatants representing the total extract used for analysis of the total protein levels. Sample volumes were adjusted with RIPA buffer containing 100 mMDTT and NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer 4× buffer (Life Technologies) and boiled for 5 min. The sarkosyl-insoluble extracts, which are highly enriched in aggregated tau species, were generated when 200 µg aliquots from the total protein extracts were normalized into 200 µl final volume containing 1% sarkosyl, followed by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 20 °C. Without disturbing the pellet, the supernatant was transferred to new tubes. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µL RIPA buffer con-taining DTT and NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer 4× buffer, followed by vortexing for 1 min and 5 min heating at 95 °C. The heat-stable extract, which contains soluble tau, was obtained when the supernatant was further processed, first by heating for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 30 min centrifugation at 20,000 × g. Extracts were transferred to new tubes containing NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer 4× buffer (4:1 (extracts/buffer) ratio). Statistical analyses for immunoblots, proteasome assays, ATPase activity and Ub5-DHFR and Ubn-Sic1 degradation assays were performed with Prism5 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test between groups with unequal variance or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test.

The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) degrades misfolded proteins including those implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the effects of tau accumulation on proteasome function in a mouse model of tauopathy and in a cross to a UPS reporter mouse (line Ub-G76V-GFP). Accumulation of insoluble tau was associated with a decrease in the peptidase activity of brain 26S proteasomes, higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins and undegraded Ub-G76V-GFP. 26S proteasomes from mice with tauopathy were physically associated with tau and were less active in hydrolyzing ubiquitinated proteins, small peptides and ATP. 26S proteasomes from normal mice incubated with recombinant oligomers or fibrils also showed lower hydrolyzing capacity in the same assays, implicating tau as a proteotoxin. Administration of an agent that activates cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling led to attenuation of proteasome dysfunction, probably through proteasome subunit phosphorylation. In vivo, this led to lower levels of aggregated tau and improvements in cognitive performance. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5095516_0,"Dendritic spine stabilization depends on afferent synaptic input and requires changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and protein synthesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we report the identification of ‘calmodulin kinase-like vesicle-associated' (CaMKv), a pseudokinase of the CaMK family with unknown function, as a synaptic protein crucial for dendritic spine maintenance. CaMKv mRNA localizes at dendrites, and its protein synthesis is regulated by neuronal activity. CaMKv function is inhibited upon phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Thr345. Furthermore, CaMKv knockdown in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons impairs synaptic transmission and plasticity in vivo, resulting in hyperactivity and spatial memory impairment. These findings collectively indicate that the precise regulation of CaMKv through activity-dependent synthesis and post-translational phosphorylation is critical for dendritic spine maintenance, revealing an unusual signalling pathway in the regulation of synaptic transmission and brain function that involves a pseudokinase. CaMKv is a pseduokinase of unknown function. Here, the authors identify the protein as a substrate of the protein kinase Cdk5, and show that CaMKv is synthesized in response to neural activity and plays an important role in maintaining dendritic spines, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal memory via RhoA inhibition.

The dendritic spines of excitatory synapses constitute individual biochemical and electrical units of brain circuitry that can be regulated or remodelled independently<1>. Synaptic input to a neuronal circuit is determined by dendritic spine density. In turn, the morphology of individual synapses is thought to reflect their function<1><2>. Abnormal spine density and morphology can underlie neurological disorders such as intellectual disabilities and autism, underscoring the importance of spine morphogenesis in brain functions.Dendritic spines are highly dynamic, and their formation, turnover and morphology depend on synaptic activity from afferent inputs<3>. Acute activity-dependent spine growth and pruning appears to underlie the learning-related forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression<4><5>. Neuronal activity is also required for dendritic spine maturation and maintenance during brain development. For example, exposing young rodents to an enriched environment increases dendritic spine density, whereas sensory deprivation increases spine turnover and reduces spine density in pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex<6><7>. One mechanism underlying spine stabilization involves activation of the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) class of excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors by spontaneously released glutamate<8><9>. Blocking vesicular release by botulinum toxin reduces spine density in hippocampal tissue sections, which can be rescued by co-treatment with AMPA<8>. The pharmacological blockade of AMPA receptors by NBQX also reduces spine density in dissociated hippocampal neurons<10>. Conversely, AMPA receptor activation stabilizes dendritic spines by decreasing spine motility, which involves Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated Ca2+ channels<9>. However, the Ca2+-binding proteins involved in AMPA receptor-mediated spine maintenance remain unknown.Dendritic spine formation and maintenance are mediated by the Rho family of small GTPases<11>. Rac1 and RhoA are the best-studied members that regulate spine dynamics; their activation facilitates and prevents dendritic spine formation, respectively<12><13>. Nevertheless, how synaptic activity differentially regulates Rac1 and RhoA to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement is largely unresolved. Different Ca2+-dependent signalling proteins may functionally link ionotropic glutamate receptors to specific Rho-GTPases. For example, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are an important class of Ca2+ effectors that trigger synaptic structural modifications<5><14>. CaMKs functionally link NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors to Rac1 activation via the phosphorylation of specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Kalirin-7, TIAM1 and β-PIX<15><16><17>. In contrast, much less is known about how RhoA is regulated by excitatory glutamate receptors. The Rho-GEF Lfc (also known as GEF-H1) is one notable link between RhoA activity and glutamate receptors<18>. Lfc is inhibited by AMPA receptors; Lfc and RhoA inhibition is implicated in spine maintenance<10>. RhoA hyperactivity can lead to spine loss and impaired synaptic function, which may underlie the behavioural deficits in intellectual disabilities associated with loss-of-function oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) mutations<19><20><21>. It is critical to explicate the Ca2+-dependent signalling protein(s) that regulate Lfc and RhoA activity downstream of glutamate receptors to better understand activity-dependent spine maintenance.Besides CaMKs, the serine/threonine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is crucial in the regulation of spine morphogenesis<22><23><24>. To understand how CaMK and Cdk5 signalling interact to regulate synaptic function, we used mass spectrometry to generate a library of synaptic Cdk5 substrates (unpublished observations). This exploratory study identified the protein CaMKv as a potential Cdk5 substrate.In the present study, we show that CaMKv synthesis is induced by neuronal activity and sensory experience, and CaMKv is required for activity-dependent dendritic spine maintenance. In addition, CaMKv regulates spine morphogenesis in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner, and its role in spine maintenance is suppressed by Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation. CaMKv interacts with Lfc and increases spine number via RhoA inhibition. Furthermore, CaMKv knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 neurons of mice enhances locomotor activity and impairs spatial memory performance. These results indicate that CaMKv serves as convergence point for the transduction of Ca2+ signals to the neuronal cytoskeleton via RhoA; hence, CaMKv interacts with Cdk5 to regulate spine dynamics and contributes to normal synaptic transmission underlying brain function. To identify novel Cdk5 substrates at neuronal synapses, synaptosome fractions were prepared from Cdk5 conditional knockout<25> and wild-type (WT) control mice. Samples were analysed by mass spectrometry. Peptides containing phospho-serine or phospho-threonine specifically in the synaptosome were detected from the WT but not the Cdk5 conditional knockout mice. A putative Cdk5 substrate identified in this proteomic screen was CaMKv, a kinase-like calmodulin-binding protein of unknown function that is abundant in the nervous system<26>. Although the level of CaMKv messenger RNA (mRNA) remains relatively constant, CaMKv protein expression was upregulated throughout brain development and neuronal maturation (<Fig. 1a>; <Supplementary Fig. 1a>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5095516_1,"Consistent with CaMKv detection in the synaptosome in our proteomic screen, CaMKv was present in the synaptic plasma membrane and postsynaptic density (PSD) of the adult rat brain (<Supplementary Fig  1b>). Immunofluorescence staining further demonstrated the co-localization of CaMKv puncta with the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (<Fig. 1b>).A recent proteomic study revealed the significant reduction of CaMKv proteins in sensory-deprived barrel cortex in vivo<27>, suggesting that CaMKv may play a role in activity-dependent synapse development. Toward this end, we first determined whether sensory experience drives CaMKv expression in the visual cortex during development. As expected, CaMKv protein in the visual cortex was elevated upon eye-opening and suppressed by dark rearing (DR; <Fig. 1c–f>). These findings indicate that CaMKv expression depends on sensory experience in vivo. To verify the regulation of CaMKv expression by synaptic activity, we enhanced or blocked neuronal activity in primary cortical neurons by treatment with bicuculline (Bic) and tetrodotoxin (TTX), respectively. Indeed, CaMKv expression was bi-directionally regulated on Bic and TTX treatment (<Fig. 1g–i>). Moreover, the induction of CaMKv synthesis was abolished by anisomycin (a protein synthesis inhibitor) but not actinomycin D (a transcription inhibitor; <Fig. 1j,k>; <Supplementary Fig. 1c>), and the level of camkv mRNA was not changed by Bic treatment (<Supplementary Fig. 1d>); this indicates that the increase in CaMKv is independent of transcription but dependent on the translation of preexisting mRNA.Increasing evidence suggests that protein synthesis in dendrites is an important mechanism in neural circuitry development and plasticity. Indeed, camkv mRNA is among the ∼2,500 transcripts detected in the hippocampal neuropil<28>. To verify the dendritic localization of camkv mRNA, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on dissociated hippocampal neurons. The camkv transcripts appeared as distinct puncta, that is, RNA granules, which were detected in distal dendrites (<Fig. 1l>). To confirm the local synthesis of synaptic CaMKv, synaptoneurosomes were prepared for metabolic labelling, in which non-canonical amino acids incorporated into newly synthesized proteins were biotin-conjugated after a click reaction<29>. Subsequent immunoprecipitation by Streptavidin beads pulled down CaMKv, indicating that it was locally synthesized at the synapse (<Fig. 1m,n>). Collectively, these findings suggest that CaMKv is a synaptic protein whose synthesis can be driven by local synaptic activity. The subcellular localization of CaMKv mRNA and protein as well as the tight regulation of CaMKv expression by synaptic activity suggest that it may play a key role at synapses. As CaMKs are implicated in spine morphogenesis<17>, we determined whether the depletion of CaMKv affects dendritic spine density and morphology. Two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed for CaMKv knockdown in cultured neurons were effective (<Fig. 2a>; <Supplementary Fig. 2a>). Dissociated hippocampal neurons (14 days in vitro (DIV)) were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct together with either CaMKv shRNA or the corresponding scrambled shRNA control. CaMKv knockdown by either shRNA significantly reduced dendritic spine density (<Fig. 2b,c>; <Supplementary Fig. 2b,c>). Co-transfection of RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant CaMKv constructs with the shRNA in cultured neurons rescued the reduced spine density, suggesting that the observed spine defects were due to CaMKv depletion (<Fig. 2b,c>). To ascertain whether CaMKv plays a permissive or instructive role in spine morphogenesis, we examined the effect of CaMKv overexpression. Compared with the vector control, CaMKv overexpression in dissociated hippocampal neurons significantly increased dendritic spine number, suggesting that CaMKv regulates spine morphogenesis in a gain-of-function manner (<Supplementary Fig. 2d,e>).Amino-acid alignment indicated that CaMKv contains a conserved calmodulin-binding site at Ala-316, cognate to Ala-302 of CaMKII, which is required for calmodulin binding<30>. To determine whether CaMKv function depends on Ca2+/calmodulin binding, we generated a CaMKv A316R mutant, which failed to bind calmodulin in the pull-down assay (<Fig. 2d>). Notably, the reduced spine density upon CaMKv knockdown could only be rescued by WT CaMKv and not the A316R mutant (<Fig. 2b,c>). Moreover, unlike WT CaMKv, A316R mutant overexpression did not increase spine density (<Supplementary Fig. 2d,e>). Sequence alignment suggests that CaMKv is a pseudokinase; accordingly, CaMKv does not exhibit kinase activity in vitro<26><31>. To corroborate the in vitro findings, we determined whether CaMKv functions in a kinase-independent manner by generating a mutation in the ATP-binding domain of CaMKv (K48R). The rescue experiment showed that the CaMKv-K48R mutant reversed the spine defects caused by the CaMKv shRNA (<Supplementary Fig. 2f,g>). These findings collectively indicate that the promotion of spine formation/maintenance by CaMKv is independent of kinase activity but requires Ca2+/calmodulin binding.Changes in spine density are closely correlated with synaptic transmission efficacy. To determine whether CaMKv knockdown regulates functional connectivity between neurons, the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were measured in dissociated hippocampal neurons on CaMKv knockdown. Consistent with spine density reduction, CaMKv knockdown reduced mEPSC frequency without affecting amplitude. Importantly, the mEPSC frequency reduction was completely rescued by co-transfection of RNAi-resistant CaMKv (<Fig. 2e–h>), indicating that CaMKv is essential for spontaneous excitatory neurotransmission. Next, we investigated the mechanism by which CaMKv regulates spine morphogenesis. As the Rho family of small GTPases has been implicated to regulate spine density<10><12><13>, we examined RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 activity after transfection of cultured cortical neurons with scrambled or CaMKv shRNA (<Fig. 3a–c>). Among the three small GTPases, RhoA activity was most drastically induced after CaMKv depletion (<Fig. 3a>; <Supplementary Fig. 3a>). Consistent with the change in RhoA activity and loss of dendritic spines, CaMKv knockdown also reduced the proportion of filamentous actin (<Supplementary Fig. 3b,c>).Next, we investigated how CaMKv suppresses RhoA activity. The activity of the Rho family of small GTPases requires binding to specific GEFs. Accordingly, the RhoA-specific GEF Lfc was pulled down by CaMKv (<Fig. 3d>). This binding was specific; CaMKv was not associated with the other Rho-GEF Ephexin1 or Rac1-GEF TIAM1 (<Fig. 3d>). Endogenous Lfc also interacts with CaMKv in the brain homogenate and synaptosome fractions (<Fig. 3e>). As CaMKv knockdown resulted in RhoA activity induction, CaMKv may inhibit RhoA through competitive binding to Lfc. To test this, co-immunoprecipitation between RhoA and Lfc was performed in the presence of GST-fusion proteins encoding different CaMKv domains. The presence of the CaMKv calmodulin-binding domain inhibited the interaction between Lfc and RhoA, while the PEST domain had no effect (<Fig. 3f>). These observations suggest that CaMKv blocks RhoA activity by preventing its interaction with Lfc. To further evaluate the function of CaMKv-RhoA signalling in dendritic spine maintenance, the effect of the Y27632 inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein kinase ROCK on CaMKv shRNA-dependent changes in spine density was assessed. While treatment with Y27632 alone did not affect spine density, Y27632 abolished the effect of CaMKv knockdown on spine density (<Fig. 3g,h>). These results demonstrate that CaMKv regulates spine maintenance through RhoA inhibition.The suppression of the Lfc/RhoA pathway by AMPA receptors is implicated in dendritic spine maintenance<10>. Given that CaMKv expression is upregulated by synaptic activity, CaMKv may be a key signalling protein that transduces the signals from AMPA receptors to suppress RhoA during activity-dependent spine maintenance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5095516_2,"Corroborating this, the AMPA receptor blocker NBQX attenuated CaMKv expression in neurons (<Fig  3i,j>). Importantly, CaMKv overexpression completely rescued NBQX-induced spine loss (<Fig. 3k,l>). These findings collectively reveal that activity-dependent CaMKv expression and the subsequent inhibition of Lfc/RhoA are required to mediate AMPA receptor function in spine maintenance. We initially identified CaMKv as a putative substrate of Cdk5 from a proteomic screen. CaMKv phosphorylation by Cdk5 was confirmed by in vitro phosphorylation assay; the presence of recombinant Cdk5 and its activator p35 significantly increased CaMKv 32P-ATP incorporation (<Supplementary Fig. 4a>). Cdk5/p35 co-expression specifically induced the Thr, but not Ser, phosphorylation of CaMKv (<Supplementary Fig. 4b>). In addition, CaMKv was co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk5 and p35 from mouse brain lysates, indicating their interaction in vivo (<Supplementary Fig. 4c>). To verify CaMKv phosphorylation by Cdk5 in vivo, we mapped the major phosphorylation sites on CaMKv; there are 10 Thr–Pro sites, and 7 are localized within the PEST domain (<Fig. 4a>). The Thr residues were individually or collectively mutated to Ala via site-directed mutagenesis. Thr345 located within the poly-Ala region was identified as the major site of CaMKv phosphorylation by Cdk5 (<Supplementary Fig. 4d>). More importantly, using an antibody that specifically recognizes Thr345 (<Fig. 4b>), we observed significant reduction of phospho-Thr345 CaMKv in p35 knockout mouse brains (<Fig. 4c,d>). These findings collectively indicate that Cdk5 phosphorylates CaMKv at Thr345 in the brain.While CaMKv expression increased in the mouse brain during development, Thr345 phosphorylation drastically decreased from postnatal day 10, which was consistent with the change of Cdk5 activity along development (<Fig. 4e>; <Supplementary Fig. 4e>). CaMKv phosphorylation in the mouse visual cortex was reduced after eye-opening, but was elevated on DR (<Fig. 4f–i>). Moreover, TTX increased Thr345 phosphorylation in cortical neurons, suggesting that the elevated phosphorylation was due to neuronal activity blockade (<Fig. 4j,k>). Given that CaMKv expression was upregulated by synaptic activity (<Fig. 1c–k>), the reciprocal regulation suggests that the phosphorylation may inhibit CaMKv function. To confirm this, we generated RNAi-resistant phospho-deficient T345A and phospho-mimetic T345E CaMKv mutants, and co-transfected them with CaMKv shRNA in a rescue experiment (<Supplementary Fig. 4h–j>). Introducing either the WT or phospho-deficient T345A CaMKv mutant rescued the loss of dendritic spines caused by CaMKv shRNA in hippocampal neurons. However, co-expression of the phospho-mimetic T345E failed to restore the defects in spine density after CaMKv depletion (<Fig. 4l,m>), suggesting that CaMKv phosphorylation by Cdk5 at Thr345 inhibits its function. Given that CaMKv depletion resulted in dendritic spine loss and impaired synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons, we examined the consequences of CaMKv knockdown in the hippocampus in vivo. Lentivirus containing CaMKv shRNA or control virus was stereotaxically injected into the hippocampal CA1 region. The GFP signal was largely confined to the injected CA1 region, suggesting that CaMKv knockdown was spatially restricted to the injected area; the knockdown efficiency was confirmed by the significant reduction of CaMKv protein expression (<Fig. 5a–c>). Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the reduced CaMKv immunoreactivity in GFP-positive neurons in the shRNA-injected mouse sections (<Fig. 5d>).We subsequently determined whether CaMKv depletion affects the spine morphogenesis of hippocampal neurons in vivo. Consistent with the findings in dissociated hippocampal neurons, CaMKv shRNA virus injection into the mouse hippocampus significantly decreased spine density in CA1 neurons compared with the control virus injection (<Fig. 5e,f>). Furthermore, delivery of ROCK inhibitor in vivo restored the spine density after CaMKv knockdown (<Supplementary Fig. 5a,b>). These findings confirm that CaMKv is required to maintain dendritic spine density through the inhibition of RhoA in vivo. Extracellular field recording of CA1 neurons also revealed attenuated synaptic transmission indicated by the ratio of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude to fibre volley (<Fig. 5g>). Therefore, CaMKv function in spine maintenance contributes to normal synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampus.Long-lasting synaptic plasticity such as late-phase LTP (L-LTP) requires de novo protein synthesis, which is the molecular basis of memory storage in the brain. As CaMKv is locally translated at synapses (<Fig. 1m,n>), we investigated whether CaMKv contributes to L-LTP. L-LTP was significantly attenuated after CaMKv knockdown, while NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression was unchanged (<Fig. 5h,i>; <Supplementary Fig. 5c>). These findings suggest that CaMKv is required for both synaptic transmission and protein synthesis-dependent LTP in the hippocampus. Given that CaMKv is important for the structure and function of hippocampal synapses, we investigated whether hippocampal-specific CaMKv knockdown affects behavioural performance. CaMKv was specifically knocked down in the CA1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus in mice using viral-mediated CaMKv shRNA. The impacts on home-cage activity, open-field exploration and the Morris water maze (MWM) performance were assessed. Mice injected with control virus served as controls. In the open-field test, CaMKv knockdown mice were hyperactive, as indicated by increased total moving distance (<Fig. 6a,b>). Consistently, home-cage activity was also increased in CaMKv knockdown mice during the initial phase (<Supplementary Fig. 5e,f>). CaMKv knockdown mice also spent significantly more time in the central area of the open field (<Fig. 6c>).The effect of CaMKv knockdown in hippocampal CA1 neurons on spatial memory formation was investigated using the MWM paradigm (<Fig. 6d–g>). Acquisition was comparable between the CaMKv shRNA-injected mice and the controls (<Fig. 6d>). However, in the MWM probe trial, control mice exhibited spatial learning and memory capability, spending significantly more time in the target quadrant than any other quadrant (<Fig. 6f>). In contrast, the CaMKv knockdown mice exhibited no significant spatial learning or memory capability, spending comparable time in the target quadrant as in the other quadrants (that is, at the level of chance; <Fig. 6f>). Accordingly, the cumulative distance from any given point of the swimming path to the platform was greater in CaMKv knockdown mice than in controls (<Fig. 6g>).Emerging evidence suggests that hippocampus contributes to spatial encoding in working memory through synaptic changes<32><33>. We therefore also determined whether CaMKv is involved in the processing of working memory. Indeed, CaMKv knockdown mice exhibited decreased alternation rate in a T-maze spontaneous alternation task (<Supplementary Fig. 5d>), indicating that CaMKv in the hippocampus is required for the encoding of information into working memory. These results collectively show that CaMKv knockdown in the CA1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus induces spatial memory deficits, underlining an important role of CaMKv in learning and memory. The maintenance and pruning of synaptic connectivity are tightly regulated by neuronal activity. Although AMPA receptor activation promotes dendritic spine maintenance, the underlying mechanism is unclear. The present study identified the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein CaMKv as a synaptic protein whose expression is regulated by AMPA receptors. Importantly, despite being classified as a pseudokinase, CaMKv plays important roles in regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory processes. Numerous pseudoenzymes including pseudokinases are encoded in the genome<31>, but few have been characterized or further demonstrated to contribute to physiological functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5095516_3,"Therefore, the present study demonstrates an unusual signalling pathway mediated by a pseudokinase in the regulation of synaptic function CaMKv was originally identified as a vesicle-associated kinase-like calmodulin-binding protein abundantly expressed in the central nervous system<26>. Despite sharing homology with CaMKII-α and CaMKII-β, CaMKv lacks a few amino-acid residues universally conserved among different members of the CaMK family and does not possess kinase activity<26>. Hence, CaMKv may be the only pseudokinase of the CaMK family<31>. While the function of CaMKv is unknown, a large-scale transcriptomic study revealed camkv as one of the many mRNA transcripts present in the synaptic neuropil<28>. In addition, a quantitative proteomics study shows that CaMKv is downregulated at the synapse on sensory deprivation<27>. Consistent with the emerging importance of the interplay between local dendritic translation and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in spine morphogenesis<3><34><35>, our findings suggest that CaMKv acts as a molecular link between AMPA receptor signalling to RhoA-dependent actin dynamics and organization (<Supplementary Fig. 6>). Hence, we hypothesize that AMPA receptor activation promotes dendritic CaMKv synthesis likely through elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor release as reported previously<34>. Supporting this hypothesis, CaMKv expression was increased in hippocampal neurons after brain-derived neurotrophic factor treatment (<Supplementary Fig. 1e,f>). The continued CaMKv synthesis on AMPA receptor activation controls RhoA activity, at least in part through the inhibition of the Lfc–RhoA interaction; in turn, the balance of RhoA activity is essential for dendritic spine stability.While dendritic spine maintenance is crucial for neural network stability, spine pruning is ongoing in both the developing and adult brain, which underlies the remodelling of neuronal connectivity through experience. If CaMKv promotes spine maintenance, termination of its action may be required during spine pruning. The present study demonstrates that CaMKv phosphorylation by Cdk5 is a major regulatory mechanism that inhibits CaMKv function. Consistent with this hypothesis, treating neurons with ephrin-A1, which activates the receptor EphA4 and induces spine retraction via Cdk5 and RhoA activation<22>, also increased CaMKv phosphorylation at Thr345 (<Supplementary Fig. 4f,g>). This suggests that ephrin-A induces the Cdk5 phosphorylation of CaMKv during spine pruning, consequently contributing to dendritic spine loss.The tight regulation of RhoA activity is crucial for proper brain function, as exemplified by its hyperactivation caused by loss-of-function mutations of the RhoA-GAP OPHN1. Since ophn1 was the first intellectual disability-associated gene to be linked to the Rho-GTPase signalling pathway<19>, multiple loss-of-function mutations of the gene have been identified<36>. OPHN1 knockdown or knockout is associated with reduced spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons in mice<20><21>. These synaptic defects are accompanied by behavioural deficits including novelty-driven hyperactivity in the open-field test and impaired spatial memory in the MWM<21>. These findings indicate that RhoA overactivation in hippocampal neurons is detrimental and leads to hyperactivity and impaired memory formation. After CaMKv is knocked down specifically in adult CA1 hippocampal neurons, the mice also exhibit hyperactivity and spatial memory defects in the MWM compared with the controls. Therefore, our findings are concordant with the idea that RhoA activity dysregulation and the subsequent impairment in hippocampal synaptic transmission lead to abnormal explorative and learning behaviours. It is noteworthy that the human camkv gene is located in chromosome 3 (3p21.31), and copy-number variants and microdeletion of this chromosome region have been reported in individuals with autism, intellectual disability and developmental delays<37><38><39><40>. This suggests a possible link between CaMKv dysregulation and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disability, which is of immense interest and warrants further investigation. Mouse CaMKv cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The shRNAs for mouse CaMKv were designed online (http://sirna.wi.mit.edu/). The RNAi target sequences were shCaMKv (5′-gaactcaaagattgtcatc-3′) and shCaMKv-2 (5′-gccaagaacgagattggaa-3′), whereas the corresponding scrambled shRNAs were Scr (5′-gaaatatcgacccgttata-3′) and Scr-2 (5′-ggaaaggccgaacaattga-3′). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, subcloned into the pSUPER vector and expressed in cortical neurons by nucleofection to confirm the knockdown efficiencies.CaMKv mutants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Meanwhile, hippocampal neurons were seeded on 18-mm coverslips (1.5 × 105 or 0.5 × 105 cells per coverslip) coated with 1 mg ml−1 poly-D-lysine. The neurons were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide. Hippocampal neurons at 14 DIV were transfected with different plasmids plus EmGFP using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation<22> and fixed at 17 DIV for morphological analysis. The visual cortical tissues were collected at the indicated time points as described previously<41>. For the DR experiments, litters regardless of gender were divided into two groups after birth: the control animals were raised in a normal light/dark cycle from birth, and the DR animals were moved into a photon-free chamber at postnatal day (P) 1–2. Both groups were killed, and their visual cortices were collected 1 day after eye-opening of the control mice<42>.For most biochemical studies, cortical neurons were lysed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay plus various protease and phosphatase inhibitors.

The external solution was bubbled with carbogen and maintained at 34±1 °C. TTX (1 μM) and Bic (10 μM) were included to block action potentials and GABA transmission, respectively. Once a whole-cell recording was achieved, the cell was held at −70 mV to record the mEPSCs and filtered at 3 kHz for 5–15 min. AMPA receptor involvement in mediating the mEPSCs was confirmed by the addition of CNQX (20 μM) that eliminated all events. The mEPSCs were analysed by MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft).For slice recording, mice were decapitated and brains were immediately removed and immersed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (125 mM NaCl, 2.0 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 11 mM glucose and 26 mM NaHCO3), which was continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Parasagittal sections (300 μm) were cut using a vibrating microtome (Leica). Slices were preincubated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 34±1 °C for at least 2 h.A planar multi-electrode recording set-up (MED64 system, Alpha Med Sciences) was used to record the fEPSPs. Each slice was superfused with 100 ml oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid, which was recirculated at a flow rate of 1.0–1.5 ml min−1. The fEPSPs were recorded from the dendritic layer of CA1 neurons by choosing an electrode in the Schaffer collateral pathway as the stimulating electrode. The input–output curve was generated by delivering electrical stimuli from 10–100 μA, and the peak amplitude of the fEPSPs was measured. A stimulation intensity that evoked the fEPSP with a magnitude of 30–40% of the maximum response was chosen. After allowing a stable baseline of 30 min, an induction protocol that evoked L-LTP was applied; five spaced trains (inter-train interval of 5 min) were applied, each consisting of six theta bursts (100 Hz, inter-burst interval of 300 ms)<23>. The field potential was monitored for at least 3 h after the conditioning stimuli.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All electrophysiology experiments were performed and analysed in a blinded manner. Virus injection was performed using 2–3-month-old adult C57/B6 mice. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G-pseudotyped lentiviral particles with pFUGW control or pFUGW-CaMKv shRNA (shCaMKv) were delivered bilaterally into the hippocampal CA1 region (anteroposterior, −2.00 mm; mediolateral, ±1.70 mm; dorsoventral, −1.4 mm; relative to the bregma), and the mice were returned to their home cages for 4 weeks before analysis. Lentivirus was injected using an animal stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting) and the quintessential stereotaxic injector (Stoelting) with an injection volume of 3 μl at 0.10 μl/min (virus titre: 2 × 108 μl−1). To analyse spine density, the viruses were diluted 10-fold with PBS before injection to label isolated CA1 neurons.The micro-osmotic pumps (1003D, Alzet) were implanted 3 days before the perfusion following manufacturer's instruction. ROCK inhibitor Y27632 was diluted in PBS as described. Images cultured neurons were acquired by a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a × 60 oil-immersion objective. We collected 8–12 serial individual optical sections (Z-interval of 0.5 μm). Images from the same experiment were obtained using identical acquisition settings, and image analysis was performed using Metamorph software (Meta Image Series 7.5, Universal Imaging). For quantification, three dendritic segments from each cultured neuron were analysed, and the head width, neck width and length of individual protrusions on the dendritic shaft were measured. If the head/neck width ratio exceeded 1.5, the protrusion was defined as a dendritic spine. For brain slices, images were acquired by a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. The proximal secondary dendrites from the apical shaft of CA1 pyramidal neurons were selected, and spine morphology and density were analysed as described above. All data are presented as the mean±s.e.m. from at least three independent experiments. The transgenic mice and C57BL/6J mice were produced by the Animal Care Facility of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), and the experiments were approved by the HKUST Animal Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with the Code of Practice Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes of Hong Kong.The MWM was performed using 3–4-month-old male C57BL/6J mice injected with shCaMKv or scrambled (Scr) lentivirus 1 month prior. The MWM was performed in a circular tank (diameter: 1.5 m) filled with opaque water. The hidden platform location was alternated for each cage (n=4 mice). Release points were randomized for each trial. The swimming path of the mice was recorded by video camera and tracked and analysed using Ethovision XT (Noldus Software). In each trial, each mouse was allowed to search for the platform for a maximum of 90 s. Once the mouse found the platform and remained for 5 s, it was left to dry and returned to its home cage. On the first day, the mice that did not locate the platform during the 90 s were gently guided to the platform and left on it for 5 s. Three to four training trials were conducted each day for 7 days, and the latency for each trial was recorded. On day 8, the probe trial was performed; each mouse was allowed to swim for 60 s with the platform removed. Performance was assessed according to the time spent in each quadrant and the cumulative distance travelled to where the hidden platform was originally located.The open-field test was performed in an open-top opaque polyethylene box (40 × 40 × 40 cm), and locomotion was tracked and analysed using Ethovision XT (Noldus Software). Each mouse was placed in the centre of the box and allowed to explore the arena for 20 min in dim light conditions. Horizontal spontaneous locomotor activity was monitored in clean home cages for 2.5 h in the dark. Mice were individually placed in standard cages located in chambers equipped with a computer-monitored infrared photobeam system (Photobeam Analysis Software, San Diego Instruments). Locomotor activity was measured as sequential adjacent beam breaks. T-maze spontaneous alternation task was performed as described<52>. Two trials were given to mice in quick succession. On the first trial, mice were started from the base of T-maze and allowed to choose one of the arms; on the second trial, mice were allowed to choose the arms without the central partition in the maze. Each mouse was tested six times within 1 day, and the duration and destination were recorded manually. All behavioural experiments and analyses were performed with the experimenter blinded to the treatment groups.

Dendritic spine stabilization depends on afferent synaptic input and requires changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and protein synthesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we report the identification of ‘calmodulin kinase-like vesicle-associated' (CaMKv), a pseudokinase of the CaMK family with unknown function, as a synaptic protein crucial for dendritic spine maintenance. CaMKv mRNA localizes at dendrites, and its protein synthesis is regulated by neuronal activity. CaMKv function is inhibited upon phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Thr345. Furthermore, CaMKv knockdown in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons impairs synaptic transmission and plasticity in vivo, resulting in hyperactivity and spatial memory impairment. These findings collectively indicate that the precise regulation of CaMKv through activity-dependent synthesis and post-translational phosphorylation is critical for dendritic spine maintenance, revealing an unusual signalling pathway in the regulation of synaptic transmission and brain function that involves a pseudokinase. CaMKv is a pseduokinase of unknown function. Here, the authors identify the protein as a substrate of the protein kinase Cdk5, and show that CaMKv is synthesized in response to neural activity and plays an important role in maintaining dendritic spines, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal memory via RhoA inhibition. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3040256_0,"Tau undergoes numerous post-translational modifications during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Some of these changes accelerate tau aggregation, while others are inhibitory. AD-associated inflammation is thought to create oxygen and nitrogen radicals such as peroxynitrite (PN). In vitro, PN can nitrate many proteins, including tau. We have previously demonstrated that tau’s ability to form filaments is profoundly affected by treatment with PN and have attributed this inhibition to tyrosine nitration. However, PN is highly reactive and unstable leading to oxidative amino acid modifications through its free radical byproducts. To test whether PN can modify other amino acids in tau via oxidative modifications, a mutant form of the tau protein lacking all tyrosines (5XY→F) was constructed. 5XY→F tau readily forms filaments; however, like wild-type tau the extent of polymerization was greatly reduced following PN treatment. Since 5XY→F tau cannot be nitrated, it was clear that non-nitrative modifications are generated by PN treatment and that these modifications change tau filament formation. Mass spectrometry was used to identify these oxidative alterations in wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau. PN-treated wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau consistently displayed lysine formylation throughout tau in a non-sequence specific distribution. Lysine formylation likely results from reactive free radical exposure caused by PN treatment. Therefore, our results indicate that PN treatment of proteins in vitro cannot be used to study protein nitration as it likely induces numerous other random oxidative modifications clouding the interpretations of any functional consequences of tyrosine nitration.

Tau transitions from its relatively soluble state into filamentous aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (<3>), constituting one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<4>–<6>). The anatomical distribution of filamentous tau inclusions correlates with the cognitive deficits diagnostic of AD, appearing first in the transentorhinal and entorhinal cortices prior to emerging in the hippocampus (<7>, <8>).Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (<4>, <9>, <10>) and truncation (<11>) are thought to contribute to tau conformational changes (<12>–<14>) that accelerate filament formation. By contrast, nitration of tyrosine residues in tau has been reported to inhibit tau filament formation in vitro (<15>–<17>).Unlike phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by naturally occurring protein kinases, nitration is thought to be the result of a non-catalytic event that involves peroxynitrite (PN). PN is a nitrogen radical posited to form in situ as the result of inflammatory processes, such as those associated with AD (<18>). This compound is capable of nitrating tyrosine residues in vitro (<19>) through its reaction with carbon dioxide leading to secondary nitrating species (<20>) that generate 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) by the addition of a nitro group. This alteration is thought to modify a protein’s hydrogen bonding, electrostatic properties, and hydrophobicity. Several groups have shown that nitration has biological selectivity and can alter both function and folding properties of the affected protein (<21>–<25>). In addition to tau, a number of proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to be nitrated (<21>–<25>).In addition to nitration of tyrosines, PN can cause oxidative modification of other amino acids including cysteine, tryptophan, histidine, and methionine among others (<20>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3040256_1,"In fact, Norris and colleagues (2003) provided evidence that PN treatment could change the behavior of proteins independent of tyrosine nitration (<26>)  The treatment of an α-synuclein mutant lacking tyrosine residues with PN impaired fibril formation, suggesting involvement of other oxidative amino acid modifications (<26>). However, the nature of these other alterations was not identified.Previously, we reported that nitration of individual tyrosine residues in tau appeared to result in inhibition of filament formation (<16>); however, we did not determine whether other oxidative modifications occurred. To address this issue, a tau mutant lacking all tyrosine residues (5XY→F tau) was used in assembly reactions both with and without PN treatment to determine whether PN treatment caused other oxidative modifications in addition to nitration in tau. Here we report that PN treatment of 5XY→F tau prevents filament formation, indicating that PN can cause modifications in tau other than tyrosine nitration. Additionally, using mass spectrometry we identified an apparently non-sequence specific oxidative modification, formylation of lysine residues, generated by PN treatment. Our results indicate that formylation of lysines is sufficient to alter the polymerization capacity of tau in vitro, suggesting that PN should not be used to study tyrosine nitration, without taking into consideration other oxidative modifications caused by PN exposure. Wild-type and mutant tau proteins were expressed using a pT7C-tau plasmid that drives the expression of full-length human tau (441 amino acids) fused to an amino terminal 6X His affinity tag (<27>). This isoform contains two N-terminal insertions (exons 2 and 3) and exon 10 which encompasses MTBR 2 (<28>–<30>). Genetic modifications were used to create different tau constructs by point mutations with a QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Four tau mutants, each containing a single tyrosine (Y) residue at position Y18, Y29, Y197, or Y394 were generated by mutating all of the other native tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (F) (<Table 1>) as previously described (<15>). A fifth tau mutant, with only Y310, was not used in this study since that residue is seldom nitrated by PN in vitro (<16>). A tau mutant containing no tyrosine residues, termed 5XY→F, was made as previously described (<15>) and used as a negative control. The identity of all the tau mutants was confirmed using DNA sequencing (Genomics Core Facility, Northwestern University). These tau mutants and wild-type tau were then expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified using a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech), followed by size-exclusion chromatography to further separate full length tau from incompletely translated tau proteins and proteolytic fragments (<31>). The purification was assayed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. PN (Cayman Chemicals) was used to nitrate tau (<15>). The PN concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 302 nm in 0.3 M NaOH (ε302=1670 M−1 cm−1) prior to each experiment (<22>). Proteins were dialyzed into nitration buffer [100 mM potassium phosphate, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaactetic acid] for 16 hours at 4°C (<15>). After dialysis, the Lowry method was used to determine protein concentrations with bovine serum albumin as a standard (<32>). The pH of the solution was kept constant at 7.4 throughout the nitration reaction (<33>). The mutant and control tau proteins were exposed to 100-fold molar excess PN twice in separate reactions with vigorous stirring for 30 seconds each time at room temperature (<15>). After PN treatment, the samples were passed through a size-exclusion column to remove any 3’,3’-dityrosine cross-linked proteins created during the nitration process. The final concentration of PN-treated proteins was measured as outlined above. Polymerization of both untreated and PN-treated wild-type tau and tau mutants was induced using the fatty acid inducer arachidonic acid (Cayman Chemicals) as previously described (<34>). This in vitro assembly paradigm accurately models tau polymerization at near physiological conditions (e.g. tau concentrations, temperature, pH and ionic strength) and the filaments are morphologically similar to tau filaments isolated from postmortem AD brains (<35>, <36>). Wild-type tau and PN-treated tau mutants were individually diluted in polymerization buffer (10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid, and 5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.6).Two distinct experimental approaches were employed. First, the effects of PN treatment on tau polymerization were assessed by measuring polymerization without (baseline) and with PN treatment of wild-type tau and single tyrosine tau mutants. Each protein, at a concentration of 4 µM, was polymerized in the presence of 75 µM arachidonic acid. Second, the effects of PN-treated tau species on polymerization of untreated tau were assayed by measuring polymerization in a reaction containing a mixture of untreated wild-type tau (4 µM) and PN-treated tau proteins (wild-type or single Y mutants) at three concentrations (0.4 µM, 0.8 µM and 4 µM). In these experiments, arachidonic acid was added to each reaction mixture separately to achieve a final concentration of 75 µM. After arachidonic acid was added, untreated tau and PN-treated tau solutions were mixed (250 µL total volume) and transferred into fluorometer cells (5 mm path length; PGC Scientific). All samples measured were illuminated with vertically polarized laser light at a wavelength of 475 nm generated by a Lexel model 65 ion laser set at 5 mW. Images were captured at a 90° angle to the incident light beam and perpendicular to the direction of polarization using a digital camera (Electrim Corp., model EDC1000HR) operated by HiCam ’95 software (written by G. Albrecht-Buehler, Northwestern University (available at http://.basic.northwestern.edu/g-buehler/hicam.htm)). Images were collected at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes. Background levels were obtained by determining the scattering intensity before the addition of arachidonic acid (time 0). The levels of scattered light were measured as pixel intensity using Photoshop 7.0 and background values were subtracted from each time point to obtain an accurate assessment of mass. The IC50 values and maximal level of inhibition were calculated using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software and compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with all multiple comparison procedures done using the Student-Newman-Keuls method. After the final LLS reading, the samples were fixed in 2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for EM analysis. Samples were absorbed onto 300 mesh, carbon-Formvar coated copper grids and then negatively stained using 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (<37>). The grids were analyzed using a JEOL JEM-1220 EM at 60 kV at a magnification of 12,000X. Five random pictures were taken from each grid for analysis. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop 7.0, and average filament number, mass, and length were quantified using Optimus 6.5 software (Media Cybernetics) as described previously (<38>). Average filament mass was determined through the summation of all the filaments, and average filament length was calculated by dividing filament mass by filament number. The level of statistical significance was set at p≤0.05, and the means were compared through a two-way ANOVA with all pairwise multiple comparison procedures done using the Holm-Sidak method. Proteins were separated by 1-D SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands of interest were excised and the proteins digested in situ with trypsin (Promega Corporation). The digests were analyzed by capillary high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) on a Thermo Fisher LTQ fitted with a New Objective PicoView 550 nanospray interface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3040256_2,"On-line HPLC separation of the digests was accomplished with an Eksigent NanoLC micro HPLC: column, PicoFrit™ (New Objective; 75 µm i d.) packed to 10 cm with C18 adsorbent (Vydac; 218MS 5 µm, 300 Å). A mass spectral scan strategy was used in which a survey scan was acquired followed by data-dependent collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra of the seven most intense ions in the survey scan above a set threshold. Mascot (Matrix Science) was used to search the uninterpreted CID spectra against a locally-generated protein database (containing the sequences of wild-type tau and the Y→F tau mutants) concatenated with the SwissProt database. For initial searches, the variable modifications that were considered were: hydroxylation (Pro); nitration (Tyr); oxidation (His, Met, Trp); and S-nitrosylation (Cys). In subsequent searches, lysine formylation was included in place of cysteine S-nitrosylation. Cross correlation of the Mascot results with X. Tandem and determination of protein and peptide identity probabilities were accomplished by Scaffold (Proteome Software). Previously, we demonstrated that PN treatment efficiently nitrates tyrosines in tau in vitro (<15>). In the absence of PN treatment, wild-type tau and the single tyrosine tau mutants readily formed filaments; however, polymerization of wild-type tau and the single tyrosine tau mutants is markedly decreased by PN treatment (<15>, <16>). The more likely scenario in situ is the presence of a mixture of non-nitrated and nitrated tau proteins. Thus, it was of considerable interest to determine whether PN-treated (nitrated) tau can influence the assembly of untreated wild-type tau. The addition of PN-treated wild-type tau to untreated tau in varying ratios (1:10, 1:5, and 1:1) was tested to establish the effects of tau nitration on polymerization of unmodified tau. The resulting measurements were normalized to polymerization of untreated wild-type tau controls that were run with each experiment. Addition of PN-treated wild-type tau to untreated wild-type tau resulted in a reduction in the total filament mass formed, but the rates of filament assembly were unaffected (<Figure 1A>). Since there was no change in polymerization rate, we chose to evaluate filament mass as a steady-state endpoint, and defined inhibition as a reduction in filaments longer than 20 nm after 5 hours incubation. The addition of PN-treated wild-type tau to untreated wild-type tau resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of filaments formed proportional to the amount of PN-treated tau added to the reaction (<Figure 1A>).This inverse relationship between the amount of PN-treated wild-type tau added and the mass of filaments formed indicated that the modifications caused by PN treatment prevented untreated wild-type tau from forming filaments. To confirm that the effects on polymerization were not a result of changing the ratio between total tau and arachidonic acid (<36>), a polymerization reaction was performed in which different concentrations of untreated wild-type tau (0.4 µM, 0.8 µM and 4 µM) were added to a second sample of 4 µM untreated wild-type tau. No change of the polymerization rate was noted but, as expected, there was an increase in the total number of filaments formed with an increase in the amount of untreated wild-type tau in the reaction (data not shown). These results indicated that the tau to arachidonic acid ratios used in this experimental paradigm did not inhibit polymerization.To determine whether nitration was causing inhibition of tau polymerization as opposed to other oxidative changes induced by PN treatment, we tested the effects of PN treatment on 5XY→F tau protein. In the absence of PN treatment, the 5XY→F tau mutant, in which all five of the tyrosine residues have been replaced with phenylalanines, assembled essentially the same as wild-type tau under the same experimental conditions in vitro (<16>). However, PN treatment caused a decrease in the ability of 5XY→F tau to polymerize into filaments, as assayed with LLS (<Figure 1B>). Furthermore, PN-treated 5XY→F tau caused a dose-dependent inhibition of untreated wild-type tau assembly (<Figure 1B>), much like the PN-treated wild-type tau. Quantitative EM assays indicated little significant difference between the mass of filaments formed when either PN-treated wild-type tau or PN-treated 5XY→F tau was incubated with untreated wild-type tau (<Figure 1C>). Representative EM images used for filament mass quantification in the PN-treated 5XY→F additions are shown in <Figure 2>. Taken together, these data suggest that PN treatment caused modifications other than tyrosine nitration that are capable of inhibiting tau filament assembly to a similar extent in both wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau. HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests of wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau was used to indentify PN-derived tau modifications. In the initial Mascot database searches of tandem-MS data, nitration, S-nitrosylation and oxidation of methionine were included as possible modifications. Tyrosine nitration was detected only in PN-treated wild-type tau samples (<Figure 3>), and S-nitrosylation was not found in any of the samples, confirming our previous results (<15>).Additional Mascot database searches were conducted using an “error tolerant” strategy in which all modifications listed in UniMod were considered to determine whether other modifications resulting from PN treatment were present. The results indentified an additional mass of 28 on numerous lysine residues, randomly distributed in both PN-treated wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau (<Figure 4>). The observed mass shift is consistent with lysine formylation (see Discussion). Since full-length tau contains 44 lysine residues, accounting for 9.98% of the 441 amino acids (<Figure S1>), the high frequency of formylation observed in both PN-treated wild-type and 5XY→F tau suggests that lysine formylation is responsible for inhibition of tau polymerization. Attempts were made to nitrate tau without causing any effects on the polymerization profile of the 5XY→F protein by using alternative methods. First, both wild-type tau and 5XY→F were exposed to different concentrations of PN (0.01–100 molar excess of PN compared to tau) to determine if there was a concentration of PN that could cause nitration and not alter the polymerization capacity of the control protein. At all concentrations, PN caused a consistent inhibitory effect on polymerization of 5XY→F (data not shown). Another nitration method was used that involves a transition metal center and nitrative reagents that have the capacity to nitrate a protein. However, this method caused unexpected results in that it drastically inhibited polymerization in 5XY→F protein, and the filaments that formed from wild-type tau did not morphologically resemble filaments typically generated from tau polymerization (data not shown).Since the lysine modification detected in our experiments appeared to have a substantial influence on tau polymerization, we reasoned that only the effects that were significantly different from PN-treated 5XY→F tau could be attributable to tyrosine nitration. The concentration of each tau mutant at which 50% inhibition (IC50) was achieved is reported in <Table 2>. The IC50 values of PN-treated wild-type tau, Y18 and Y197 are statistically significant when each is compared to PN-treated Y29, Y394 and 5XY→F. In addition to the differences in IC50 values of the various tau constructs, the amount of maximum inhibition of wild-type tau polymerization must also be taken into consideration to determine if any tau mutant is significantly different from PN-treated 5XY→F tau. In comparing the maximal inhibition of wild-type tau polymerization, PN-treated Y197 was the only tau construct statistically significant from all other PN-treated tau mutants, wild-type tau and 5XY→F (<Table 2>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3040256_3,"Surprisingly, nitration at Y197 appears to reduce the inhibitory effects of lysine formylation as PN-treated Y197 tau formed significantly more filaments alone and when added to untreated wild-type tau compared to the PN-treated 5XY→F polymerization profiles (<Figure 5A>)  Comparative analysis of the IC50 values and maximal inhibition for all tau species used in this study (<Table 2>) revealed that PN-treated Y394 tau was an appropriate representative of the similarity of the PN-treated single tyrosine mutants compared to 5XY→F (<Figure 5B>). In contrast, PN-treated Y197 tau was statistically significant when compared to both the IC50 and maximal inhibition of 5XY→F, and the maximal inhibition achievable with this mutant was lower than the other variants (56.6% inhibition). The observation that Y197 tau cannot inhibit normal tau assembly to the same extent as the other tau mutants could indicate that nitration at site 197 stabilizes the soluble conformation of the protein, making it more assembly competent.Quantitative EM analyses confirmed that PN-treated wild-type tau, Y18, Y29 and Y394 single tyrosine tau mutants were not significantly different when compared to PN-treated 5XY→F tau in inhibiting the assembly of wild-type tau. In contrast, the total filament mass of PN-treated Y197 tau was significantly greater than PN-treated Y394 and 5XY→F tau when polymerized alone or at the 1:1 dilution with untreated tau (<Figure 5C>). In addition, when polymerized in isolation, PN-treated Y197 exhibited a statistically significant increased amount of filaments compared to all the other PN-treated single tyrosine tau mutants and wild-type tau (data not shown). However, at the 1:10 and 1:5 dilutions, Y197 was not different from PN-treated 5XY→F tau (<Figure 5C>). These findings indicate that, after PN treatment, the Y197 single tyrosine mutant can readily assemble despite the presence of lysine formylation. Evidence reported in the literature clearly demonstrates that tyrosine nitration occurs in several proteins in neurodegenerative diseases (<39>). Understanding the way nitration affects protein function is crucial to determining how this modification plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Indeed, previous studies have confirmed that tau is nitrated during the progression of AD (<40>–<42>). Currently, the prevailing hypothesis is that PN, created by inflammatory processes (e.g. reaction between superoxide and nitric oxide), is the primary nitrating agent (<43>). Paradoxically, only a relatively small number of proteins appear to be nitrated in situ, and addition of a nitrate group on a single tyrosine residue can be sufficient to cause protein dysfunction (<21>). The current study demonstrates that PN treatment can nitrate tau, but, under the conditions used, there were additional modifications (e.g. lysine formylation) that had a substantial effect on tau polymerization. This indicates that PN treatment under these common experimental conditions is not specific for tyrosine nitration in vitro.PN is a potent one- or two-electron oxidant that can spontaneously form •OH and •NO2 radicals (<44>). PN does not directly react with tyrosine but oxidizes and nitrates through radical byproducts (<19>). The free radicals interact with tyrosine and can abstract a hydrogen atom from the amino acid creating a tyrosyl radical. This radical can recombine with •NO2 to form 3-nitrotyrosine. The protocol used to nitrate and oxidize tau in this report is a well-established and commonly used method, but in most cases, additional modifications by PN exposure are not considered. Previous studies have established that PN causes not only nitration of tyrosines, but can also oxidize and/or nitrate cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, histidine, and phenylalanine among other amino acid residues. (<19>, <20>). In the absence of CO2 (in the form of bicarbonate), cysteine is the amino acid that reacts the fastest with PN (<20>). In the presence of CO2, cysteine oxidation is decreased by 50% because the direct reaction of PN with CO2 outcompetes the reaction with the thiol of the cysteine (<20>). Using mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the two cysteines within the wild-type tau were not modified by PN. The common use of PN as a seemingly convenient nitrating agent in vitro stems from the increase of nitrotyrosine formation in the presence of CO2, created through the use of a 25 mM bicarbonate buffer during PN treatment (45). Also, the nitration reaction can be promoted through exposure of the tyrosine, association with a negative charge, and absence of proximal cysteines (<22>). For these reasons, as well as confirmatory mass spectrometry data (<15>, <45>–<47>), PN exposure became a widely used method for protein nitration.Our data clearly demonstrate that non-nitrative modifications occur in vitro and emphasize the need for proper controls when working with PN. A particularly striking discovery of our studies was uncovered when we examined PN-treated 5XY→F tau. After PN treatment, 5XY→F tau was unable to self-assemble into filaments, and it decreased the polymerization capacity of the unmodified tau species when co-incubated in solution. This suggests that PN treatment is causing an oxidative change that, in some manner, affects the ability of the untreated wild-type tau in solution to polymerize. These results closely mirrored those found with an α-synuclein mutant lacking tyrosines that was treated with PN (<26>). Norris and coworkers (2003) showed that PN treatment significantly reduced the amount of fibrils formed by an α-synuclein mutant lacking all tyrosine residues in vitro (<26>). While the authors acknowledged that the PN treatment must have caused other oxidative modifications, the identities of these modifications were not determined. Hence, it is possible that lysine formylation may have played a role in functionally altering α-synuclein as well, but this cannot be ascertained without further analysis.Lysine formylation was not only found in the 5XY→F tau, but also in PN-treated wild-type tau. Formylation is the addition of HCO to the primary amino group on the side chain of lysine, eliminating a basic site on the protein. Although this is the most likely modification that could occur in our experimental paradigm, other groups have demonstrated that PN can create formaldehyde in a reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (<48>, <49>). Even though DMSO is not present in our reaction, creation of formaldehyde through the reaction of PN and the bicarbonate buffer could cause formylation of the lysine residues in tau. Other possibilities that would create an additional mass of 28, such as a dimethyl modification of lysine, cannot be completely excluded; however, there seems to be little likelihood of lysine dimethylation under these experimental conditions. Interestingly, lysine formylation did not appear to be site-specific as this modification was found throughout the protein. The fact that this modification was found at numerous lysine residues within the protein and that it changes the charge of the amino acid certainly could explain its disruption of tau polymerization in vitro. However, since the modification appeared to be non-sequence specific, it might not be possible to elucidate a clear mechanism for the influence of the formyl-lysine residues on tau polymerization.Little is known about lysine formylation, and certainly, the effects of lysine formylation have not been studied in the context of tau function, its presence in AD and its role in disease pathogenesis. However, lysine formylation has been identified as a post-translational modification of histones and other nuclear proteins (<50>, <51>). Multiple formylation sites in histones have been shown to be important in DNA binding and may interfere with chromatin function, leading to cellular dysfunction and diseases such as cancer (<50>). Additionally, lysine formylation can be stimulated by oxidative stress (<51>). Oxidation of histones and lipid peroxidation have been suggested to contribute to the vulnerability of DNA to oxidation in AD brain (<52>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC3040256_4,"Oxidative stress creates free carbonyls that arise from side-chain oxidations of lysine as well as other amino acids (<53>)  It has been demonstrated that carbonyl formation is a major oxidative modification that can result from PN in addition to the nitration of tyrosine phenols (<42>). Alzheimer’s disease tissue has been recognized to have increased carbonyl reactivity associated with neurofibrillary changes; indicative of an increase in oxidative stress during neurodegeneration (<42>, <54>). In addition, the distribution of nitrotyrosine reactivity in situ in AD has been reported to be very similar to the staining of free carbonyls (<42>, <54>). Other studies have demonstrated that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) a product of oxidative stress, can modify the nucleophilic side chains of several amino acids including lysine (<55>, <56>). Oxidation by HNE causes carbonyl enhancement of lysines and this modification stabilizes the Alz50 epitope (<57>). It has been reported that this increase in the Alz50 conformation mediated by HNE is also dependent upon the phosphorylation of tau (<58>). These studies of HNE mediated lysine modifications suggest that carbonyl-modified tau may be a crucial component of the change from soluble tau to NFTs (<57>, <58>). Also, selective carbamoylation of lysines reduces the capacity of tau to induce microtubule assembly and induces aggregation of tau into filaments (<59>) These studies strengthen the conclusion that lysine modifications may alter the normal polymerization profile of tau; however, further research is required to elucidate the effects of lysine formylation on tau folding and function.A critically important finding in this work is the fact that PN cannot be used in vitro as a nitrating agent under these commonly used experimental conditions because it causes additional oxidative modifications that must be taken into consideration. These results bring into question the interpretation of our previous study conducted with the site-specific nitrated tau mutants (<16>). Importantly, we did confirm the polymerization results initially reported with PN-treated single tyrosine mutants (<16>), but it was necessary to reinterpret the data from this past publication in light of these new findings. The polymerization profile of 5XY→F tau after PN treatment must be taken into consideration prior to assaying the effect of nitration at specific tyrosine residues. Only one single tyrosine tau mutant had a significantly different effect on filament formation when compared to 5XY→F tau. The single tyrosine mutant Y197 appeared to be less affected by PN treatment in that it could still form filaments even though some of its lysines were likely formylated. Tyrosine 197 is located within the proline rich region of tau where there is also an abundance of lysine residues (<Figure S1>). This ability for PN-treated Y197 to form filaments could suggest that nitration at Y197 neutralizes the negative effect of formylation on the assembly process to some degree. Nitration at this site could also affect the ability of the surrounding lysines to be formylated. Further research is necessary to determine the method by which nitration at Y197 may affect filament formation in disease progression.There are numerous important implications of the current study. First and foremost, PN cannot be used to study nitration in vitro under experimental conditions utilizing a bicarbonate buffer, as random formylation of lysines will likely mask any change due to nitrotyrosine formation. Second, if proteins known to contain 3-nitrotyrosine modifications are isolated from tissue, but do not contain formylated lysines, it is unlikely that PN is the effector responsible for tyrosine nitration. Third, accumulating data and results from our study supports the view that the likelihood of PN as a nitrating agent in situ is very low since nitrated proteins (including tau) have been found in normal cells and animals (<60>–<62>). Lastly, if PN is not responsible for nitration then one must posit other means for the nitrative modifications observed. Since nitration appears to be selective and specific in situ, it is tempting to speculate that nitration occurs through a more specific, enzymatic reaction; however, such a nitrotransferase has yet to be described. That said, a nitrotyrosine denitrase has been identified that can remove nitro groups from previously nitrated proteins (<63>).In summary, our work indicates that PN treatment of tau causes nitration on tyrosines and non-sequence specific addition of formyl groups to lysine residues. This work likely invalidates the common experimental protocol that uses PN as a nitrating agent in the presence of a bicarbonate buffer on most proteins and suggests that alternative means must be discovered or developed to study the effect of nitration on protein function in vitro. Tau undergoes numerous post-translational modifications during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Some of these changes accelerate tau aggregation, while others are inhibitory. AD-associated inflammation is thought to create oxygen and nitrogen radicals such as peroxynitrite (PN). In vitro, PN can nitrate many proteins, including tau. We have previously demonstrated that tau’s ability to form filaments is profoundly affected by treatment with PN and have attributed this inhibition to tyrosine nitration. However, PN is highly reactive and unstable leading to oxidative amino acid modifications through its free radical byproducts. To test whether PN can modify other amino acids in tau via oxidative modifications, a mutant form of the tau protein lacking all tyrosines (5XY→F) was constructed. 5XY→F tau readily forms filaments; however, like wild-type tau the extent of polymerization was greatly reduced following PN treatment. Since 5XY→F tau cannot be nitrated, it was clear that non-nitrative modifications are generated by PN treatment and that these modifications change tau filament formation. Mass spectrometry was used to identify these oxidative alterations in wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau. PN-treated wild-type tau and 5XY→F tau consistently displayed lysine formylation throughout tau in a non-sequence specific distribution. Lysine formylation likely results from reactive free radical exposure caused by PN treatment. Therefore, our results indicate that PN treatment of proteins in vitro cannot be used to study protein nitration as it likely induces numerous other random oxidative modifications clouding the interpretations of any functional consequences of tyrosine nitration. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC6371980_0,"Acetylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau promotes its polymerization into neurofibrillary tangles that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) regulates cell signaling through the nitrosylation of proteins. We found that NO production and tau acetylation at Lys280 occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ1–42), a peptide that is also implicated in AD. An increased abundance of NO facilitated the S-nitrosylation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). S-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The abundance of GAPDH-SNO was increased in postmortem brain samples from AD patients. Preventing the increase in GAPDH-SNO abundance in both cultured neurons and mice, either by overexpression of the nitrosylation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) or by treatment with the GAPDH nitrosylation inhibitor CGP3466B (also known as omigapil), abrogated Aβ1–42-induced tau acetylation, memory impairment, and locomotor dysfunction in mice, suggesting that this drug might be repurposed to treat patients with AD. We thank S. Snyder (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) for sharing the constructs related to GAPDH and SIRT1. We also thank W. Lariviere (University of Pittsburgh) for editing the manuscript. Funding:  This research was supported by the NIH grants R01NS094516 and R01EY025622. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory and higher cognitive functions and, as an aging- associated disease, is increasing in incidence (<1>–<5>). Plaque deposits of amyloid, mostly composed of amyloid-β (Aβ1–42), are a key feature of AD and are implicated in its pathology (<6>–<8>). Numerous studies have shown that a high or toxic amount of recombinant oligomeric Aβ1–42 elicits neuronal death, synaptic dystrophy, loss, and dysfunction, and learning and memory deficits in AD patients and transgenic mice models of AD (<6>, <8>, <9>). Brain regions that are often affected by the deposition of the amyloid plaque include the hippocampus, the cortex, and subcortical structures, such as the basal forebrain and the amygdala (<10>, <11>).The protein tau is also implicated in AD and regulates neuronal functions by binding and stabilizing microtubules (<12>–<15>). However, the acetylation of tau impairs its interaction with microtubules and promotes its aggregation (<16>–<20>). Lys280-acetylated tau is detected in postmortem AD patient brain tissue (<21>) and in insoluble fractions in brain lysates from both transgenic mouse models of AD, in which the abundance of Lys280-acetylated tau increased with age in the cortex (<21>), suggesting that Lys280 acetylation of tau promotes its aggregation and its role in AD. Notably, acetylation of tau at this epitope is preceded by other modifications, including phosphorylation, and is succeeded by truncation modifications and cell death in AD.Numerous studies have shown that an increase in nitrosative stress is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, ultimately leading to synapse loss or neuronal cell death, which are common in several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (<22>–<24>). Nitric oxide (NO) mediates cell signaling through the nitrosylation of proteins, in which NO is covalently incorporated into a cysteine residue in the protein, forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO) (<25>). We previously reported that p300- mediated acetylation of Lys160-nitrosylated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH-SNO), in turn, promotes GAPDH-mediated acetylation of p300 (<26>), which is critical for its catalytic activity (<26>). Elsewhere, we have also shown that GAPDH-SNO interacts directly with the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), upon which the NO group is transferred from GAPDH-SNO to SIRT1 at Cys387/390, which impairs its catalytic activity (<27>). Here, we investigated whether these NO-induced effects on GAPDH, p300, and SIRT1 have a role in AD with regard to tau and amyloid pathology. To investigate whether Aβ1–42 has any influence on tau acetylation, we isolated primary neurons from the cortex of mice, treated them with Aβ1–42 oligomers, and monitored Lys280 acetylation on tau by Western blotting and confocal microscopy. We found that tau acetylation at Lys280 increased significantly in response to Aβ1–42, but not in the presence of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (<Fig. 1A and B>, and <fig. S1, A and B>). We repeated these analyses with wild-type or Nos1 -null (hereafter nNOS−/−) mice that had been intracortically injected with a control peptide or with Aβ1–42 and again found the acetylation of tau at Lys280 to be nNOS-dependent (<Fig. 1, C and D>, and <fig. S1, C and D>). In addition, tau acetylation was increased in primary neurons isolated from nNOS+/+ mice compared to those from nNOS−/− mice treated with Aβ1–42 (<Fig. 1E> and <fig. S1E>). Together, these data suggest that Aβ1–42 up-regulates tau acetylation at Lys280 in an NO-dependent manner in neurons. Previously, it was demonstrated that tau can be acetylated by activation of the acetyltransferase p300 (<19>), and we have shown that activation of p300 can be activated by the nitrosylation of GAPDH in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, macrophages, and dopaminergic neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells (<26>). Given our results above that Aβ1-42 induces tau acetylation through a nitrosylating enzyme, we hypothesized that the mechanism may be mediated by the nitrosylation of GAPDH and subsequent activation of p300. To test our hypothesis, we first assessed the amount of nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) that was present in postmortem cortical samples from AD patients. We found significantly greater amounts of nitrosylated GAPDH in AD samples than in controls (postmortem cortical samples from individuals of similar age range with no known dementia) (<Fig. 2A> and <fig. S2A>). A biotin-switch assay in cortical lysates from mice revealed that GAPDH nitrosylation was inducible by administration of Aβ1–42 (<Fig. 2B>). Previously, we reported that GAPDH can be nitrosylated at the Cys150 residue (<26>,<28>). To see whether Aβ1–42 nitrosylates GAPDH at that residue, we overexpressed wild-type GAPDH or expressed mutant (C150S) GAPDH in primary neurons isolated from mice and treated them with Aβ1–42. Aβ1–42-induced nitrosylation of GAPDH was abolished in cells that expressed GAPDH C150S (<Fig. 2C>).Previously, we determined that nitrosylated GAPDH interacts with the acetyltransferase p300 and that this interaction mediates the acetylation of both p300 and GAPDH (<26>). Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays confirmed that the interaction between GAPDH and p300 was substantially induced by Aβ1–42 in primary neurons overexpressing wild-type but not C150S-mutant GAPDH (<Fig. 2D>), as well as in nNOS+/+ but not nNOS−/− mice (<Fig. 2E>). Furthermore, the acetylation of both p300 GAPDH was markedly increased in primary neurons that overexpressed wild-type but not C150S- mutant GAPDH (<Fig. 2F>).Our previous findings also indicated that GAPDH is acetylated at Lys160 and that preventing acetylation of GAPDH inhibits the acetylation of p300, which is indispensable for its catalytic activity (<26>). Overexpression of a nonacetylatable mutant (K160R) of GAPDH in primary neurons significantly inhibited Aβ1–42-induced acetylation of p300 and of H3 histone, a marker p300 acetyltransferase activity (<Fig. 2G> and <fig. S2B>). Confocal microscopy analysis further confirmed that Lys280-acetylated tau was increased in the cortex of mice injected with Aβ1–42 and which overexpressed wild-type but not K160R-mutant GAPDH (<Fig. 2H> and <fig. S2C>). Furthermore, RNA interference [RNAi; specifically small interfering RNA (siRNA)] mediated depletion of p300 in primary neurons before exposure to Aβ1–42-inhibited tau acetylation (<Fig.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC6371980_1,"2I> and <fig  S2D>). However, disruption of p300 decreased Aβ1–42-induced tau acetylation by roughly only half in cells and in vivo (<Fig. 2>, G and I, and <fig. S2, B and D>); this suggests that activation of p300 may be only partially responsible for the increase in tau acetylation. Given the partial effects of p300 inhibition and our previous findings that the deacetylase SIRT1 is inactivated through transnitrosylation by GAPDH-SNO (<27>), we hypothesized that concurrent inactivation of a deacetylase, perhaps SIRT1, may also contribute to tau acetylation. To test this hypothesis, we tested the interaction between tau and SIRT1 in the cortex of nNOS+/+ and nNOS−/− mice after administration of Aβ1–42. We found that the interaction between SIRT1 and tau after administration of Aβ1–42 was decreased significantly in nNOS+/+ mice compared to nNOS−/− mice (<Fig. 3A> and <fig. S3A>), indicating that SIRT1 may regulate tau acetylation in an NO-dependent manner. Accordingly, we found that Aβ1–42 induces SIRT1- SNO (<Fig. 3B>) along with an interaction of GAPDH with SIRT1 (<Fig. 3C>) in the cortex of nNOS+/+ mice.To further substantiate whether SIRT1 was transnitrosylated by GAPDH-SNO upon administration of Ab1–42, we overexpressed either wild-type or C150S-mutant GAPDH in the cortex of mice and administered Aβ1–42. We found that the interaction between GAPDH and SIRT1 (<Fig. 3D>) and the nitrosylation of SIRT1 and GAPDH (<Fig. 3E> and <fig. S3B>) were increased in the cortices of mice overexpressing wild-type GAPDH, but not GAPDH C150S after administration of Aβ1–42 (<Fig. 3D>). Consistent with this in vivo data, we found that nitrosylation of SIRT1 was decreased in cells that overexpressed GAPDH C150S (<Fig. 3F>). We infer that a decrease in interaction between GAPDH and SIRT1 results in a loss of nitrosylation of SIRT1, which indicates that SIRT1 can be nitrosylated by transnitrosylation reaction through its interaction with nitrosylated GAPDH. Thus, blocking nitrosylation of GAPDH results in prevention of SIRT1 nitrosylation.SIRT1 is nitrosylated at residues Cys387/390 and mutation of these residues abolishes its nitrosylation (<27>). To test whether overexpression of SIRT1 C387/390S has any influence on the interaction between SIRT1 and tau and the acetylation of tau in cells, we isolated primary neurons and transfected them with either SIRT1 C387/390S or wild-type SIRT1 constructs before we administered Aβ1–42 to the cultures. We found that the interaction between tau and SIRT1 was increased substantially in cells that overexpressed SIRT1 C387/390S compared to cells that overexpressed SIRT1 (<Fig. 3G> and <fig. S3C>). To see whether an interaction between tau and nitrosylated SIRT1 affects tau acetylation, we monitored tau acetylation at residue Lys280 by Western blot hybridization. We found that acetylation of tau was decreased by not more than 50% (<Fig. 3H> and <fig. S3D>), although the interaction between SIRT1 and tau was increased significantly in cells that overexpress SIRT1 C387/390S compared to cells that overexpress SIRT1 (<Fig. 3H>). As a control, we tested acetylation of H3 after administration of Aβ1–42 in cells that overexpress SIRT1 or SIRT1 C387/390S. We found that H3 acetylation was increased significantly in cells that overexpress SIRT1 C387/390S compared to cells that overexpressed SIRT1 (<Fig. 3H>). The influence of nitrosylation of SIRT1 on tau acetylation was further assessed by confocal microscopy after overexpression of either SIRT1 or SIRT1 C387/390S in the cortex. We found that tau acetylation was increased substantially in cortical cells that overexpressed SIRT1 but not SIRT1 C387/390S (<Fig. 3I> and <fig. S3E>).These data suggest that nitrosylation of SIRT1 is sufficient to block its deacetyltransferase activity but is not enough to reduce the acetylation of tau. These data can be explained in two ways: (i) that it may be possible that another deacetylase, such as HDAC6, is involved in tau acetylation at Lys280 and/or (ii) that tau acetylation at Lys280 depends on both activation of p300 and inactivation of SIRT1. Thus, preventing only the inactivation of SIRT1 will not rescue the tau acetylation at residue Lys280. To test whether another deacetylase, such as HDAC6 (<16>), is involved in tau acetylation at Lys280, we depleted HDAC6 in primary neurons before administration of Aβ1–42 and monitored the acetylation of tau by Western blot hybridization. We found that tau acetylation at Lys280 remains unaltered in cells depleted of HDAC6 (<Fig. 3J> and <fig. S3F>). Thus, we concluded that HDAC6 may not be responsible for acetylation upon Aβ1–42 and excluded the first possibility. Given that our data show that an increase in GAPDH-SNO is responsible for activation of p300 and inactivation of SIRT1, we anticipated that reducing the amount of GAPDH-SNO would prevent both events and consequently Aβ1–42-induced acetylation of tau at Lys280. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed the nitrosylation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) into the cortex before administration of Aβ1–42 and measured tau acetylation in that brain region. We found that tau acetylation at Lys280 was increased after administration of Aβ1–42 in mice that overexpressed wild-type GAPDH but not those that overexpressed GAPDH C150S (<Fig. 4A> and <fig. S4A>). These data suggest that the ni-trosylation of GAPDH is critical for tau acetylation. This was further confirmed by confocal microscopy analysis wherein acetylation of tau was increased significantly despite no change to total tau abundance (<Fig. 4, B and D>, and <fig. S4B>).Previously, we reported that treatment with CGP3466B reduced the nitrosylation of GAPDH both in vivo and in cultured cells (<29>–<31>). To test whether treatment with CGP3466B can reduce tau acetylation, we administered CGP3466B in mice at two concentrations (0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg) before administrating Aβ1–42 into the cortex and monitored tau acetylation by confocal microscopy. The amount of acety- lated tau in Aβ1–42-treated cortex was abolished by treatment with CGP3466B at the higher dose (2.5 mg/kg) (<Fig. 4C> and <fig. S4C>). We also measured GAPDH-SNO level and tau acetylation using the lysates prepared from the cortex after administration of Aβ1–42 into the cortex. We found that nitrosylation of GAPDH was prevented (<Fig. 4D> and <fig. S4D>), and tau acetylation was reduced significantly (<Fig. 4E> and <fig. S4E>) in mice treated with CGP3466B compared to those treated with vehicle. These data further support the conclusion that GAPDH-SNO is a critical mediator of tau acetylation in the brain.To test whether blocking GAPDH nitrosylation rescues behavioral impairments associated with tau acetylation, we measured locomotor activity by the open-field test and spatial memory by the Morris water maze test in mice pretreated with CGP3466B before being administered with Aβ1–42. Compared to mice administered with Aβ1–42 only, pretreatment with CGP3466B improved the activity of the mice in the open-field test by more than 82% (<Fig. 4F>) and reduced the latency to find the platform (<Fig. 4G>). These data suggest that blocking GAPDH nitrosylation improves the locomotor and spatial memory deficits caused by Aβ1–42 exposure. We have shown here that administration of Aβ1–42 nitrosylates GAPDH, which inactivates SIRT1 through augmenting its nitrosylation level via transnitrosylation reaction. At the same time, nitrosylated GAPDH activates p300 by increasing its acetylation level. Both inactivation of SIRT1 and activation of p300 contribute to an augmentation in the level of tau acetylation preferably at Lys280, which was previously shown to contribute to tau aggregation (<Fig. 4H>).The direct infusion of oligomeric Aβ1–42 into the wild-type mouse brain provided an in vivo model to acutely increase the amount of Aβ1−−42 in a spatial and temporal manner. The advantage of using wild-type mice for this model avoids the potential compensation or side effects from the mutations introduced in transgenic mouse lines (<32>–<34>). Past studies have shown that infusing toxic amount of Aβ1–42 into the brain results in tau phosphorylation (<35>, <36>).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC6371980_2,"Our study provides insight into pathological tau acetylation after infusion of Aβ1–42 into the cortex Our data indicate an augmentation in tau acetylation contributed significantly by inactivation of SIRT1 and activation of p300. Nota-bly, either blocking p300 or activating SIRT1 singularly did not reduce tau acetylation at Lys280. The deacetylation of tau is also reportedly regulated by SIRT1 (<19>, <37>) and HDAC6 (<38>, <39>), and blocking HDAC6 activity or genetically reducing HDAC6 expression reportedly alters tau acetylation (<40>). However, our results suggest that HDAC6 does not regulate the acetylation of tau at Lys280 specifically, but that SIRT1 has a substantial role.An induction of NO in response to Aβ1–42 has been demonstrated previously (<41>–<43>). Their studies have highlighted the importance of nitrosylated proteins in the pathogenesis of AD. They have shown that nitrosylation of mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 (<44>) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (<42>) facilitates mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic alteration, which contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of AD. Our study shows that nitrosylation of GAPDH and SIRT1 regulates pathological tau acetylation at Lys280. The nitrosylation of SIRT1 was identified a few years ago (<27>), however, its role in the pathogenicity of neurological disorders is not established. Our study suggests that preventing the ni-trosylation of SIRT1 by reducing GAPDH-SNO abundance will be instrumental in reducing pathological tau acetylation at Lys280.The nitrosylation of GAPDH has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<31>), mental disorders (<45>), and in mouse models of hyperactivity induced by a drug of abuse, such as cocaine (<30>). However, the role of nitrosylation of GAPDH in tauopathies has not been identified yet. Our study could be the first example where nitrosylation of GAPDH significantly contributes to the acetylation of tau. Moreover, inhibition of nitrosylation of GAPDH by administration of CGP3466B has been shown to provide neuroprotection in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine-treated mice model of PD (<31>), ketamine- induced mental disorder (<45>), and cocaine-induced hyperactivity in mice (<30>). Here, we have shown that treatment with CG- P3466B reduces tau acetylation and provides neuroprotection against Aβ-induced toxicity. Moreover, treatment with CGP3466B reverses the deficits in memory and lack of locomotor function induced by Aβ1–42. Together, our data provide a framework to develop a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce tau acetylation, considered as one of the major causes for tau aggregation and consequent toxicity in neurons. Before injection, the Aβ1–42 peptide was dissolved in a physiological saline solution at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 72 hours to induce aggregation (<46>,<47>). All the animal studies conducted were according to the Committee on Animal Use for Research and Education at Georgia Regents University and the University of Pittsburgh in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, as described previously by others and our laboratory (<48>–<51>). For the Aβ1–42 injections, male C57BL/6 mice (8 to 10 weeks) were divided into four groups (n = 5) per treatment. Both nNOS+/+ and nNOS−/− mice were anesthetized with xylazine (8 mg/kg) and ketamine (60 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection, mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and injected with 100 μM Aβ1–42, as described before (<34>, <50>). Motor function of the mice was assessed with the open-field test, and memory function was assessed with the Morris water maze test after 7 days after infusion of Aβ1–42 into the cortex (both behavior experiments are described below). Mice were treated with CGP3466B (2.5 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal injection after 20-min infusion of Aβ1–42 into the cortex. Either hemagglutinin (HA)-GAPDH, HA-GAPDH C150S, HA-GAPDH K160R, SIRT1, or SIRT1 C387/390S was injected into the brain using the in vivo DNA transfection reagent jetPEI (Polyplus- transfection) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with little modification (<52>–<54>). Briefly, each construct and jetPEI were separately diluted in a 5% sterile glucose solution. Our formulation corresponds to a nitrogen and phosphate (N/P) ratio of 7. A 5-μl volume of the polyethyleneimine-plasmid complexes was stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the cortex. The control and HDAC6 RNAi (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-35545) were injected into the mouse brain using jetSI reagent (Polyplus-transfection) according to the manufacturer’s protocol 4 days before administration of Aβ1–42 into the cortex with little modification (<55>). All the experiments and analysis were performed in a blinded manner. The assay was performed as described (<29>,<49>, <56>), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells/tissues were first lysed for 10 min on ice in NP-40/ Hepes-EDTA-Neocuproine (HEN buffer adjusted to contain 0.4% NP-40) and then centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min. at 4°C. The pellet was then resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)/ HEN (HEN buffer adjusted to contain 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g at 4°C. The supernatant was then used for the assay. In addition, labeling was performed in the dark for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature with 5 mM sodium ascorbate and 0.4 mM biotin-HPDP (Pierce), and pull down was performed overnight with high-capacity neutravidin agarose (Pierce). In the Morris water maze test, the hidden platform procedure was performed in a circular tank filled with opaque water as described already with minor modifications (<48>,<49>). For training, the mice (8 to 12 weeks old) received Aβ1–42 in the cortex, were placed in the tank at four random points, and were allowed to search for and find the platform. In the event that the mouse did not find the platform within the 60-s trial period, the mouse was manually put on the platform for an extra 30 s. Two trials were given every day, and the latency to find the platform in each trial was recorded. A probe trial was performed on day 6 or 7, in which mice were allowed to swim in the tank for 60 s without the platform, and performance was assessed as the time spent in the quadrant in which the hidden platform was originally located. Locomotor activity was assessed in mice treated intraperitoneally with Aβ1–42 and with or without CGP3466B (2.5 mg/kg) using open- field tests, performed as described previously (<46>). Briefly, the animals were placed at the center of the arena and allowed to explore the apparatus freely for 60 min with the experimenter out of the animal’s sight. A black square arena (100 cm × 100 cm × 60 cm) was used for the test. The total distance travelled was analyzed using a video-tracking software. The preparation of the primary cortical neurons from the nNOS+/+ and the nNOS−/− mice was performed as described previously (<29>, <48>, <49>). Pregnant mice at embryonic day 18.5 gestational age based on the vaginal plug determination method were anesthetized with xylazine (8 mg/kg)/ ketamine (60 mg/kg) and cleaned using 70% ethanol. The uterus was opened, and pups were placed in sterile prechilled Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Each pup was mounted on the stereomicroscope, and cortices were dissected out. After enzyme-based digestion, cortical neurons were counted and plated on the sterilized cover glass or six-well plates in serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with appropriate growth supplements (B27 and N2, Life Technologies). The medium was changed every 3 to 4 days. For the biochemical experiments, neurons were washed, scraped off, and collected in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. The protein content was estimated by the Bradford method. Primary neurons were treated with Aβ1–42 (100 μg/ml) for 24 hours in subsequent experiments. All experiments were performed with 10- to 12-day-old cultures, at which time the cultures contain ~95 to 98% neurons and 2 to 5% astrocytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC6371980_3,"We overexpressed GAPDH, GAPDH C150S, and GAPDH K160R in primary neurons using jetPRIME reagent (Polyplus- transfection) according to the manufacturer’s protocol  Briefly, the complexes were added to the media of 6- to 8-day-old primary neuronal cultures. After 3 to 4 days, Aβ1–42 was added and cells were incubated for 24 hours then either homogenized for biochemical assays or processed for immunohistochemistry as described below. Neurons were collected into a sample buffer [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1% SDS containing protease inhibitors: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leu-peptins (10 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml)] (<57>). Then, equal amounts of protein for each sample were run in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and transferred using polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight with the primary antibody for acetylated tau-K280 (AnaSpec; 1:200). After washing, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody and imaged using Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system as described previously (<49>,<58>,<59>). Mouse or human brain tissue samples were lysed in RIPA containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were spun to remove the insoluble fraction, and the concentration of protein was quantified using a Bradford assay. Brain tissues were suspended and homogenized in 5 vol/g of RIPA buffer [50 mM tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS]. Finally, resultant insoluble pellets were extracted in 1 vol/gram of tissue in urea buffer [7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 30 mM tris (pH 8.5)]. Soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting using the indicated antibodies to detect total and acetylated tau proteins, as described previously (<16>,<47>, <60>). For the co-IP assay, each lysate isolated from cells/tissues was incubated overnight with either antibodies to acetyl-lysine (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:200), tau (AnaSpec; 1:200), or GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000). Then, samples were pulled down with immunoglobulin G beads and run into SDS-PAGE gel. The membrane was used for Western blotting using antibodies against acetylated tau-K280 (AnaSpec; 1:100), SIRT1 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:500), p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500), and GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2000). Neurons were fixed with 3 to 4% paraformaldehyde containing sucrose for 15 min at room temperature, as described previously (<26>, <48>,<49>). Briefly, cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M, pH 7.4), then incubated in blocking serum, to which antibodies were added [antibodies to acetylated tau (1:200 dilution; K280, AnaSpec), total tau (1:200 dilution; AnaSpec), and actin (1:3500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology)]. Cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 and fluorescein isothiocyanate, and coverslips were mounted on a poly-L-lysine-coated glass slide in a mounting medium containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For the brain samples, 8- to 10-μm frozen sections were rehydrated and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were then blocked using a serum and incubated with primary antibodies. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating sections with 0.5 N HCl containing trypsin, as described previously. Tagged secondary antibodies were applied, and sections were washed again and mounted in medium containing DAPI. Sections were analyzed under confocal Zeiss 710 Meta microscope. Images were obtained using integrated image acquisition software, ZEN 2012, and analyzed in a blinded manner. rhetorical Fig. 1.

(H) A working model of our findings suggesting that Ap1–42 leads to an induction in the level of nitric oxide (NO), which, in turn, nitrosylates GAPDH. Nitrosylated GAPDH interacts with an acetyltransferase p300 and a deacetylase SIRT1. The interaction between p300 and GAPDH facilitates an activation of p300 and an induction of tau acetylation. The interaction between SIRT1 and GAPDH results in nitrosylation of SIRT1, which is unable to deacetylate tau. Inhibition of GAPDH-SNO reduces tau acetylation and improves behavioral impairments. Acetylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau promotes its polymerization into neurofibrillary tangles that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) regulates cell signaling through the nitrosylation of proteins. We found that NO production and tau acetylation at Lys280 occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ1–42), a peptide that is also implicated in AD. An increased abundance of NO facilitated the S-nitrosylation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). S-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The abundance of GAPDH-SNO was increased in postmortem brain samples from AD patients. Preventing the increase in GAPDH-SNO abundance in both cultured neurons and mice, either by overexpression of the nitrosylation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) or by treatment with the GAPDH nitrosylation inhibitor CGP3466B (also known as omigapil), abrogated Aβ1–42-induced tau acetylation, memory impairment, and locomotor dysfunction in mice, suggesting that this drug might be repurposed to treat patients with AD. .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5101637_0,"In the expanding field of anticancer drugs, HDAC inhibitors are playing an increasingly important role. To date, four/five HDAC inhibitors have been approved by FDA. All these compounds fit the widely accepted HDAC inhibitors pharmacophore model characterized by a cap group, a linker chain and a zinc binding group (ZBG), able to bind the Zn2+ ion in a pocket of the HDAC active site. Romidepsin, a natural compound, is the only thiol derivative. We have selected a new class of synthetic HDAC inhibitors, the thio-ω(lactam-carboxamide) derivatives, with ST7612AA1 as drug candidate, pan-inhibitor active in the range of single- to two-digit nanomolar concentrations. Preliminary results of a synthetic optimization attempt towards a fast scale-up process are here proposed. In the four steps of synthesis, from unsaturated amino acid intermediate to the final product, we explored different synthetic conditions in order to have a transferable process for a scale-up synthetic laboratory. In the first step, isobutyl chloroformate was used and, after a simple work up with 1M HCl, 2 (96% yield) was obtained as a white solid, which was used directly in the next step. For thioacetic acid addition to the double bond of intermediate 2, two different routes were possible, with addition reaction in the first (D’) or last step (D). Reactions of 2 to give 5 or of 4 to give ST7612AA1 were both performed in dioxane. Reactions were fast and did not need the usually advised radical quenching with cyclohexene. The corresponding products were obtained in good yields (step D’, 89%; step D, 81%) after a flash chromatography. , a thiol derivative prodrug of ST7464AA1, is the first of a new generation of HDAC inhibitors, very potent, orally administered, and well tolerated. Here, we have identified a synthetic route, competitive, versatile and easily transferable to industrial processes. Declared none. The authors Gianfranco Battistuzzi e Giuseppe Giannini are employees of Sigma-Tau I.F.R. SpA. In the expanding field of anticancer drugs, HDAC inhibitors are playing an increasingly important role [<1>]. To date, four HDAC inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: Vorinostat (Merck, 2006), Romidepsin (Gloucester Pharmaceuticals now Celgene, 2009), Belinostat (TopoTarget now Onxeo, 2014) and Panobinostat (Novartis, 2015) for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and multiple myeloma. Recently, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration has also approved Chidamide (Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences, 2015) for the treatment of PTCL (Fig. <1>). All of them are also being investigated for the treatment of different types of cancers as well as other diseases, as single agents and in combination therapies [<2>].Moreover, approximately 15 new HDAC inhibitors are in different stages of clinical trials and an even greater number of molecules are currently under preclinical investigation. It is worth noting that only over the last two years three HDAC inhibitors have been consecutively approved, which indicates the rapid development of the field of HDAC inhibitors.All these compounds fit the widely accepted HDAC inhibitors pharmacophore model characterized by a cap group, a linker chain and a zinc binding group (ZBG), able to bind the Zn2+ ion in a pocket of the HDAC active site [<1>].HDAC inhibitors obtained by total synthesis are hydroxamic acid or benzamide derivatives. Romidepsin, the only natural HDAC inhibitor, is a thiol derivative discovered from cultures of Chromobacterium violaceum, a Gram-negative bacterium isolated from a Japanese soil sample [<3>].Benzamide-based inhibitors are usually selective for class I HDACs (1, 2, and 3) while hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors - more prevalent – are, unfortunately, metabolically unstable (i.e. with a short half-life) and show an off-target activity at other zinc-containing enzymes. Besides, they are more active in hematological malignancies than in solid tumors due to the peculiar pharmacokinetic profile [<4>]. In addition, many hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors have been shown to be Ames-positive and to cause chromosomal aberrations and this makes them suspected of genotoxicity [<5>].Accordingly, the availability of novel inhibitors with nonhydroxamate ZBGs represents a highly desirable condition. The thiol and the mercaptoacetamide groups have been widely investigated in HDAC inhibitors and provided compounds with comparable HDAC inhibitory potency and cancer cell growth inhibition [<6>-<10>].The role of thiols in the control of the cellular redox environment, essential for normal physiological function, is well-reported [<11>]. Oxidative stress is particularly prevalent in cancer where many malignant cell types possess an abnormal redox metabolism involving down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and impaired mitochondrial function. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in many signal transduction pathways via the oxidation of redox sensitive cysteine residues. The range of cellular processes under redox regulation is extensive and includes both the proliferative and apoptotic pathways. Therefore, thiol-based HDAC inhibitors are of great interest for their potential synergistic pharmacological effects between ROS and histone acetylation. In Sigma-Tau, after more than a decade of research activity, a new class of synthetic HDAC inhibitors, the thio-ω(lactam-carboxamide) derivatives, has been selected. The drug candidate stemming from this class is ST7612AA1, a γ-lactam derivative, pan-inhibitor active on eleven HDAC isoforms in the range of single- to two-digit nanomolar concentrations [<12>]. It is also active at sub-micromolar concentrations on a large number of tumor cell lines as well as effective in in vivo tumor models. After either oral or parenteral administration, ST7612AA1 showed a good tolerability, safety and negligible body weight loss, with a fast acetyl group hydrolysis to form the corresponding active drug (thiol) (Fig. <2>) [<13>].Recently, it has also been investigated as an HIV-1 latency reactivation agent where ST7612AA1 showed to be a potent activator of latent HIV. The reactivation activity is exerted without activation or proliferation of CD4+ T cells, making this drug candidate useful for new potential therapies to eradicate the viral reservoirs [<14>].However, it should be stated that these thiol-based HDAC inhibitors cannot be considered as simple bioisosteric analogues of their corresponding hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors [<15>]; indeed, a study on parasites highlighted an important difference between the two classes with, contrary to expectations, the hydroxamic acid derivatives more potent than the counterpart thiols [<16>].Overall, this new class of drugs represents a breakthrough in the field of HDAC inhibitors, and ST7612AA1 is a drug candidate with a broad therapeutic potential. Thio-ω(lactam-carboxamide) derivatives could be obtained by different and versatile synthetic strategies; for example, our first approach drew a synthetic route with 12 steps, starting from diethyl acetamidomalonate, using an enzimatic stereoselective N-deacetylation to resolve racemic mixture (Scheme 1).However, to get to the final step the enzymatic strategy could be avoided; ST7612AA1 was obtainable through easily approachable and competitive industrial process.Here we report our preliminary results of a synthetic optimization attempt towards a fast scale-up process. Reagents, solvents and anhydrous solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. The exclusion of moisture from reagents and glassware was performed following standard techniques for manipulating air-sensitive compounds. Flash chromatography was performed on pre-packed silica gel columns (50 μm particle size) with the indicated solvent systems. Thin layer chromatographies (TLCs) were performed on pre-coated, glass-backed silica gel plates (Merck 60F254). Visualization was performed under short-wavelength ultraviolet light or by iodine vapour staining into a iodine development chamber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5101637_1,"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on Gemini spectrometers (Varian) at 300 or 500 MHz or on Bruker spectrometer at 300 Mhz  Peak positions are given in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane as the internal standard; J values are expressed in hertz. Mass analyses were performed on Waters ZQ2000 spectrometer using electrospray (ES) technique. High resolution mass spectra were obtained by an Orbitrap spectrometer. HPLC analyses were performed on a Waters apparatus (HPLC Waters Alliance 2695 and PDA-UV detector 2996) equipped with a column Phenomenex Gemini C6-Phenyl (3 μm, 150 x 4.6 mm). A thiol-ene process is the key step of the synthetic route for ST7612AA1, starting from the commercially available (S)-2-tertbutoxycarbonylamino-hept-6-enoic acid 1 (Scheme 2). The reaction between thiol groups and ene-carbon-carbon double bonds (reported since the early 1900s [<17>]) belongs to the world of the well-known “click chemistry” because of some of its features: in fact, it is characterized by high yields, regio- (and stereo-) specificity (anti-Markonikov products), oxygen- and water-insensitivity and it can be performed under very mild reaction conditions. It is commonly defined as “thiol click-chemistry” [<18>]. This reaction is known to proceed via radical or anionic chain mechanisms, named respectively “thiol-ene reaction” and “thiol Michael addition”.In the last decades, the use of thermally sensitive radical initiators, such as AIBN (Azobisisobutyronitrile), for many thiol–ene reactions has emerged as necessary, particularly for the functionalization of biological materials [<19>-<22>] and for large-scale syntheses, where photoinitiation was not viable and high temperatures and thermal initiators allowed achieving uniform bulk radical generation.A great variety of thiols were used in many examples of AIBN-initiated thiol-ene reactions, such as radical construction of dendrimers functionalized with sugars, surface functionalization of semiconducting nanoparticles, and so on [<18>].Moved by all these features towards scaling up of the process, we designed a ST7612AA1 synthesis where the thioacetate group was built by an AIBN-catalyzed addition of thioacetic acid to a terminal double bond (Scheme 2, step D or D’).The first synthesis of ST7612AA1, on multi-mg scale, were performed in our laboratory. Now here report also the yields of a synthesis on ten-gram scale as it obtained from an outsourcing laboratory engaged in the preparation of the product (A comprehensive comparison of yields, in Table S1; Supplementary Data). Our synthesis started with the coupling of aniline with (S)-2-tertbutoxycarbonylamino-hept-6-enoic acid (Scheme <2>, step A). We performed a little screening of different coupling reagents in order to compare reagents (cost), yields, and inversion of the chiral center (Table 
<1>).Chiral separation and enantiomeric excess (ee) determination were performed by HPLC on a chiral column (Phenomenex Lux Cellulose-2, 250*4.6mm, 5 κ m) using n-hexane/isopropanol with 0.1% v/v diethyl amine as eluting mixture. In order to know the retention time of the two enantiomers, a racemic mixture of 1 was first used in the reaction with aniline (see Supplementary Material, Fig. <1>) Only the optimization procedure with single steps is here reported. For a complete characterization of each intermediate and final product, the interested readers are encouraged to read our previously published full paper [<12>]. Step A. (S)-2-Tertbutoxycarbonylamino-hept-6-enoic acid (379 mg, 1.56 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DCM (8 mL) and the mixture was cooled at 0°C with an ice bath. Under stirring, N-methylmorpholine (169 mg, 1.67 mmol) and isobutyl chloroformate (228 mg, 1.67mmol) were added. After 1 hour under stirring at 0°C, aniline (145 mg, 1.56 mmol) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm at room temperature. After 2 hours TLC monitoring showed complete conversion of the starting material; the mixture was diluted with DCM and washed two times with 1M HCl, two times with NaHCO3ss (satured solution), and finally, with brine. The organic phase was dried on Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 2 (477 mg, 96% yield) as a light brown solid that was used directly for the next step. Step B. Compound 2 (472 mg, 1.48 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (16 mL) and the mixture was cooled at 0°C with an ice bath. Trifluoroacetic acid (4 mL, 52.24 mmol) was added under stirring and the mixture was allowed to warm at room temperature. After five hours, the conversion was complete and the solution was diluted with DCM, then washed two times with NaHCO3ss and brine. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 3 (320 mg, 99%) as a brown glassy solid that was used directly for the next step. Step C. (2R)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (49 mg, 0.38 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DCM (2 mL) and the mixture was cooled at 0°C with an ice bath. Under stirring, N-methylmorpholine (40 mg, 0.40 mmol) and isobutyl chloroformate (54 mg, 0.40mmol) were added. After one hour 3 (82 mg, 0.38 mmol) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm at room temperature. After 2 hours conversion was not complete and a premixed solution (0.5 mL in DCM) of (2R)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (0.04 mmol) N-methylmorpholine (0.04 mmol) and isobutyl chloroformate (0.04 mmol) was added. After another hour, TLC showed complete conversion. The mixture was diluted with DCM and washed two times with 1M HCl, the same with NaHCO3ss and finally, with brine. The organic phase was dried on Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 4 (100 mg, 81% yield) as a white solid that was used directly for the next step. Step D. Compound 4 (121 mg, 0.37 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (10 mL) and, under stirring, thioacetic acid (280 mg, 3.67 mmol) was added. The mixture was warmed at 75°C with an oil bath and AIBN (30 mg, 0.18 mmol) was added. After one-hour TLC monitoring showed complete conversion of 4; the mixture was cooled at room temperature and then to 0°C and an excess of cyclohexene was added. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with DCM and washed with 5% Na2CO3 and brine. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by chromatographic column (eluent DCM/MeOH = 95/5) to give ST7612AA1 as a white solid (125 mg, 81% yield). Step D’. Compound 2 (143 mg, 0.45 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (9 mL) and, under stirring, thioacetic acid (342 mg, 4.49 mmol) was added. The mixture was warmed at 75°C with an oil bath and AIBN (37 mg, 0.22 mmol) was added. After one-hour TLC monitoring showed complete conversion of 2; the mixture was cooled at room temperature and then to 0°C and an excess of cyclohexene was added. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with DCM and washed with 5% Na2CO3 and brine. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by chromatographic column (eluent cyclohexane/AcOEt = 80/20) to give 5 as a white solid (158 mg, 89% yield). Step B’. Compound 5 (158 mg) was dissolved in DCM (4 mL) and the mixture was cooled at 0°C with an ice bath. Trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added under stirring and the mixture was allowed to warm at room temperature. After three hours the conversion was complete and the solution was diluted with DCM and concentrated under reduced pressure (three cycles of dilution and concentration) to give 6 as trifluoroacetate salt (163 mg, quantitative yield) as a brown glassy solid that was used directly for the next step. Step C’. Compound 6 (163 mg, 0.4 mmol), (2R)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (57 mg, 0.44 mmol) and DIPEA (155 mg, 1.20 mmol) were added to anhydrous DCM (3 mL) under stirring at room temperature. After complete dissolution, PyBOP (228 mg, 0.44 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. Conversion was not complete but the mixture was worked up because of evidence of 6 degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PMC5101637_2,"The mixture was diluted with DCM and washed two times with 1M HCl, two times with NaHCO3ss and finally, with brine  The organic phase was dried on Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by chromatographic column (eluent AcOEt/MeOH = 95/5) to give ST7612AA1 as a white solid (110 mg, 68% yield). As shown in Table <1>, this first step could be performed avoiding the use of expensive coupling reagents such as PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) or HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluoro- phosphate); EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)- carbodiimide) and isobutyl chloroformate gave, surprisingly, about the same ee of PyBOP, which becomes even more advantageous considering that no chromatographic purification was needed after work up. Indeed, reaction with isobutyl chloroformate, after a simple work up with 1M HCl, saturated NaHCO3 and brine, gave 2 (96% yield) as a white solid, which was used directly in the next step. Incidentally, HCl was preferable to the more commonly used citric acid, because of a more efficient extraction of N-methylmorpholine.For thioacetic acid addition to the double bond of intermediate 2, two different routes were possible, with addition reaction in the first (D’) or last step (D) (Scheme 2). Reactions of 2 to give 5 or of 4 to give ST7612AA1 were both performed in dioxane at 75°C with 0.5 equivalents of AIBN and 10 equivalents of thioacetic acid. Reactions were fast and did not need the usually advised radical quenching with cyclohexene. The corresponding products were obtained in good yields (step D’, 89%; step D, 81%) after a flash chromatography.Concerning yields, we can observe that route D’-B’-C’ was slightly worse than the other due to a poor yield in step C’. Besides, when using 6 (particularly as free base) for coupling to (2R)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, a less polar byproduct was observed, subsequently identified as the N-acetylation derivative 7 (Fig. <3>).Indeed, it is known in literature that some attempts to deprotect S-acetate of 3-mercaptoproline derivatives, under basic conditions, resulted in an intramolecular trans-acetylation [<23>]. We therefore hypothesized that the organic base used in the coupling steps could be responsible for the same process, albeit giving an intermolecular reaction in this case. It must be said, however, that 7 was also observed in a reference sample for TLC, where 6 was simply stored in DCM at room temperature.These concerns have pushed us to consider as favorite the alternative route, through the B-C-D steps, with the advantage to use, for step C, the cheaper conditions with isobutyl chloroformate and N-methylmorpholine.

In conclusion, ST7612AA1, prodrug of ST7464AA1, is the first of a new generation of HDAC inhibitors, very potent, orally administered, and well tolerated. It is a thiol derivative, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, active against a broad panel of cancer cell lines and in vivo tumor models. It was also an activator of latent HIV, potentially useful in HIV antiretroviral therapy.In the present paper, the effects of different synthesis routes at lab scale for ST7612AA1 synthesis were discussed. In Scheme <1> we reported our first synthetic way based on enzymatic resolution and thioacetylation by nucleophilic substitution with potassium thioacetate. Avoiding the enzymatic pathway (steps a-e), the highlighted intermediate in Scheme 1 could be obtained from the commercial 2-tert-butoxycarbonylaminohept-6-enoic acid by a simple hydrobromination. However, we have chosen the way of thioacetylation reaction by a radical mechanism, that yields the final product in only four steps, with high yields, easily, inexpensive and reproducible scalable process. ST7612AA1 is now completing the preclinical studies, with emphasis on evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties, with the aim to identify the optimal dose and the identification of the best therapeutic indication. Once this phase will be ended, whether this new drug will enter in a clinical trials phase, it will be necessary a scale-up of the synthetic process. The results obtained from this study and here presented, will be an important starting point for this process. rhetorical Fig. (1) Structures of FDA approved HDAC inhibitors. rhetorical Fig. (2) Structures of ST7612AA1 and the corresponding active drug after in vivo hydrolysis. rhetorical Fig. (3) Structure of side product 7 from step C’ of the synthetic procedure described in (Scheme 2). rhetorical Scheme 1 Reagents and conditions: (a) 1) EtOH, EtONa, reflux, 30 min; 2) Br(CH2)5Br, reflux, 3h; (b) NaOH aq, EtOH, 0°C, 5h; (c) toluene, reflux, 4h; (d) NaOH aq, EtOH, 0°C, 4h; (e) aminoacylase, H2O, pH7, CoCl2.6H2O, 38°C, 24h; (f) (Boc)2O, Et3N, THF, H2O, r.t., 20 h; (g) R1NH2, EDCI, HOBt.H2O, THF, r.t.; (h) KSAc, EtOH, RT; (i) CF3COOH, CH2Cl2, r.t., 5h; (l) R2COOH, DMF, PyBOP, DIPEA, r.t., 20 h. rhetorical Scheme 2 Reagents and conditions: (A) Aniline, isobutyl chloroformate, N-methylmorpholine, DCM, r.t.; (B,B’) DCM/TFA (4/1), 0°C – r.t.; (C) (2R)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, isobutyl chloroformate, N-methylmorpholine, r.t.; (D,D’) CH3COSH, AIBN, Dioxane, 75°C; (C’) (2R)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, DIPEA, PyBOP, DCM, r.t.
