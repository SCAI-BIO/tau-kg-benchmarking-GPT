PMC4414438_0,"Excitotoxicity (the toxic overstimulation of neurons by the excitatory transmitter Glutamate) is a central process in widespread neurodegenerative conditions such as brain ischemia and chronic neurological diseases. Many mechanisms have been suggested to mediate excitotoxicity, but their significance across diverse excitotoxic scenarios remains unclear. Death Associated Protein Kinase (DAPK), a critical molecular switch that controls a range of key signaling and cell death pathways, has been suggested to have an important role in excitotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism by which DAPK exerts its effect is controversial. A few distinct mechanisms have been suggested by single (sometimes contradicting) studies, and a larger array of potential mechanisms is implicated by the extensive interactome of DAPK. Here we analyze a well-characterized model of excitotoxicity in the nematode C. elegans to show that DAPK is an important mediator of excitotoxic neurodegeneration across a large evolutionary distance. We further show that some proposed mechanisms of DAPK’s action (modulation of synaptic strength, involvement of the DANGER-related protein MAB-21, and autophagy) do not have a major role in nematode excitotoxicity. In contrast, Pin1/PINN-1 (a DAPK interaction-partner and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase involved in chronic neurodegenerative conditions) suppresses neurodegeneration in our excitotoxicity model. Our studies highlight the prominence of DAPK and Pin1/PINN-1 as conserved mediators of cell death processes in diverse scenarios of neurodegeneration.

Excitotoxicity is a neurodegenerative process believed to be the central mediator of brain damage in acute conditions such as brain ischemia and traumatic injury, and an important contributor to a range of chronic neurodegenerative diseases [<1>-<4>]. In excitotoxicity, the malfunction of Glutamate (Glu) Transporters (GluTs) [<5>-<7>] causes accumulation of Glu in excitatory synapses and exaggerated stimulation of postsynaptic Glu receptors (GluRs) [<8>]. The excessive influx of ions (especially Ca2+) into the postsynaptic neurons leads to their cell death via a spectrum of mechanisms that range from necrosis (at the core of the ischemic damage) to apoptosis or even recovery (at the penumbra). Despite our familiarity with the first few steps in excitotoxicity, our understanding of the steps following Ca2+ influx is very limited. Clinical trials using GluRs antagonists ended with disappointment, and recent data suggests that using antagonists to block GluR functions might be counterproductive, because Glu signaling includes both neurotoxic and pro-survival cascades [<9>,<10>]. These complications emphasize the need to illuminate cell-death-specific signaling cascades in excitotoxicity downstream of GluRs. A considerable number of such excitotoxic mechanisms have been suggested, but in many cases the data that supports a given suggestion is limited to specific excitotoxic paradigms.One suggested mediator of excitotoxicity implicated in multiple experimental setups is the CaM-dependent Death Associated Protein Kinase (DAPK) [<11>-<14>]. Originally identified by an unbiased screen for mediators of interferon-induced cell death [<15>], DAPK was later recognized as a molecular switch that controls the choice between cell death processes such as apoptosis and autophagy [<16>,<17>]. Moreover, an elaborate web of biochemical interactions and functional connections has been revealed, placing DAPK in a key position at the center of many critical signaling cascades [<11>,<18>]. A considerable body of evidence suggests that DAPK also contributes to cell death in excitotoxicity [<19>], and its inhibition reduces neuronal loss in models of brain ischemia [<20>]. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain DAPK’s involvement in excitotoxicity, but the issue remains controversial. One possible mechanism involves DAPK’s regulation of autophagy [<17>], a process that modulates some neurodegenerative conditions [<21>]. Alternatively, an intriguing study suggests the involvement of DANGER, a protein that contains a region of homology to the nematode protein MAB-21 and functions as a regulator of the IP3R [<22>]. Indeed DANGER was found to also interact with and inhibit the activity of DAPK [<23>]. The most cited suggestion in the field attributes the involvement of DAPK in excitotoxicity to the potentiation of Ca2+ currents through NR2B/GluN2B subunit-containing complexes of the NMDA- receptor (NMDA-Rs) family of GluRs [<24>]. This suggestion fits well with a proposed leading role for extrasynaptic NR2B/GluN2B –containing NMDA-Rs in excitotoxicity [<25>]. However, recently the proposed unique significance of NR2B/GluN2B –containing extrasynaptic NMDA-Rs in excitotoxicity has been brought into question [<26>-<28>]. Moreover, an earlier study suggests that in some mammalian neurons DAPK knockout provides protection from excitotoxicity that is not dependent on NMDA-Rs [<29>]. Indeed, some cases of excitotoxicity are mediated by another family of GluRs, the Ca2+ -Permeable AMPA Receptors (CPARs) [<30>-<32>]. These observations suggest that if DAPK is widely involved in excitotoxicity, including in cases where NR2B/GluN2B is not a main determinant of neurodegeneration, it might act through additional mechanisms to exert its effect.We hypothesize that many signaling cascades might be involved in specific cases of excitotoxicity, depending on the exact scenario being used to induce it. However, the key features that constitute the core of the excitotoxic process might be conserved across differences in cell death scenarios and large evolutionary distances, as is the case in apoptosis [<33>,<34>] and autophagy [<35>,<36>]. We therefore set out to study the role of DAPK in excitotoxicity in our model of CPAR-mediated neurodegeneration in C. elegans [<37>], where GluR-dependent necrosis of central neurons postsynaptic to Glu connections is triggered by knockout (ko) of the GluT gene glt-3 [<38>] in a sensitized background (nuIs5 [<39>]). Indeed, this model has proven effective in identifying core processes that are conserved between nematode and mammalian excitotoxicity [<37>,<40>,<41>]. DAPK is particularly well conserved in C. elegans (in 52% sequence homology, presenting all of DAPK’s functional domains, and in its involvement in a number of signaling cascades [<42>-<44>]). The nematode DAPK-1 is widely expressed (including in neurons [<42>]), allowing us to test its involvement in nematode excitotoxicity and to study its mechanism of action. In this study we establish the central role of DAPK in Glu-triggered neurodegeneration in C. elegans, suggesting that its function is conserved across evolution and excitotoxic scenarios. We find little or no support for the views that DAPK’s regulation of excitotoxicity is mediated through the modulation of synaptic strength, MAB-21, or autophagy. Instead, we identify PINN-1, the nematode homolog of the DAPK-interaction-partner and phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, as an important factor in nematode excitotoxicity."
PMC4414438_1,"To test the involvement of DAPK in nematode excitotoxicity we combined our excitotoxicity strain (glt-3;nuIs5) with a deletion allele of the nematode homolog of DAPK, dapk-1(gk219), a gene knockout that was used to confirm the effect of the (ubiquitously expressed) nematode DAPK in autophagy and innate immunity [<42>,<45>]  In our previously described model of neurodegeneration we use the sensitizing transgenic modification nuIs5, where hyperactive Gαs and GFP are expressed under the glr-1 promoter in ~30 neurons [<39>] and cause GluR-independent stochastic degeneration of ~1 of these at-risk neurons per animal. When we add the KO of the GluT gene glt-3 we observe that more of these at-risk neurons degenerate [<37>]. The GluT-KO-triggered exacerbated necrosis in glt-3;nuIs5 is GluR-dependent, and therefore qualifies as nematode excitotoxicity. Nematode excitotoxicity causes neuronal swelling and death that is manifested with characteristic kinetics as gradually and stochastically appearing vacuole-like structures in some of the at-risk postsynaptic neurons. These vacuole-like structures become more abundant during larval development as the Glu signaling system matures (usually reaching up to ~4.5 head neurons/animal at L3), and then decline due to removal of cell corpses by engulfment [<37>]. We now observe that adding dapk-1 ko to this excitotoxicity strain causes a strong and statistically significant suppression of neurodegeneration throughout development (Figure <1>A, an additional independent cross gave very similar results, not shown). To further confirm the contribution of dapk-1 to nematode excitotoxicity, we overexpressed the wt dapk-1 cDNA from an extra-chromosomal transgenic construct under a heat-shock promoter [<42>]. Since heat-shock might affect susceptibility to neurodegeneration, we took special care to compare an exact match of treated animals, without or with the dapk-1 overexpression transgene. To that end we took advantage of the fact that the random and partial segregation of the non-integrated overexpression construct allows us to compare transgenic and non-transgenic animals on the same plate exposed to the same conditions. We observed that dapk-1 overexpression resulted in a strong and statistically significant potentiation of necrotic neurodegeneration in postsynaptic neurons in all developmental stages (Figure <1>B). Together, our data indicate that DAPK is an important mediator of excitotoxicity in C. elegans, suggesting that diverse scenarios of excitotoxicity share a common mechanism that assigns a central role to DAPK. rhetorical Figure 1 dapk-1 is an important mediator of nematode excitotoxicity.

Together, our data indicate that DAPK is an important mediator of excitotoxicity in C. elegans, suggesting that diverse scenarios of excitotoxicity share a common mechanism that assigns a central role to DAPK. We used two main guidelines in trying to track the mechanism by which dapk-1 regulates excitotoxic neurodegeneration in the nematode: 1) we looked at previous reports suggesting specific mechanisms for DAPK’s involvement in mammalian excitotoxicity; 2) we inferred from the general map of DAPK’s connectome in other cell processes [<18>] which additional proteins are plausible candidates for mediating DAPK’s effect in nematode excitotoxicity. One line of evidence suggests that DAPK interacts with, and may regulate the function of, Syntaxin 1A [<46>]. Syntaxin is part of the general mechanism of vesicular neurotransmitter release, a mechanism that is shared among all neurotransmitters [<47>]. Therefore, an effect of dapk-1 ko on any component of the synaptic vesicle release could lead to DAPK-mediated changes in excitotoxicity levels. However, given the ubiquitous expression of this gene, such an effect of DAPK on the common synaptic vesicle release mechanism will affect the dynamics of neurotransmitter release in all synapses. The study of synaptic vesicle release is very well developed in the nematode, and aldicarb is routinely used in C. elegans to identify mutations that cause even modest changes to the general synaptic release mechanism [<48>]. As aldicarb suppresses the degradation of Acetylcholine in the neuro-muscular junction, it causes animal paralysis with a typical dynamics. Mutations that reduce the activity of the general, common vesicle release mechanism (such as rab-3 [<48>]) cause a pronounced resistance to aldicarb (shifting the time-dependent paralysis curve to the right, Figure <2>A), while mutations that enhance synaptic release (such as the ko of cpx-1, which encodes the synaptic vesicle release regulator complexin [<49>]) cause increased sensitivity to aldicarb (shifting the paralysis curve to the left, Figure <2>A). We observed that the sensitivity of dapk-1 animals to aldicarb is indistinguishable from that of WT animals, suggesting that dapk-1 ko does not modify the synaptic release mechanism, as would have been expected of an effect on syntaxin (Figure <2>A). rhetorical Figure 2 The effect of dapk-1 does not correlate with several proposed mechanisms. A) Aldicarb assay measures the overall activity of the common mechanism of synaptic vesicle release."
PMC4414438_2,"Complexin (cpx-1) mutant is used as example of an oversensitive mutant (where synaptic release is exaggerate), while rab-3 serves as an example of aldicarb resistant mutant (where synaptic release is abnormally low)  dapk-1 mutants do not show oversensitivity or resistance, suggesting their level of synaptic release is roughly normal. B) Duration of forward runs during spontaneous mobility is a sensitive reporter of the overall strength of Glu synapses that control this parameter. Even small changes in the activity or number of GluRs typically modify this behavior. dapk-1 mutants are not different from normal counterparts in either a WT background, in an excessive Glu stimulation background (glt-3), or in the sensitized background (nuIs5) used in our excitotoxicity model. These three conditions by themselves do not cause excessive command neuron loss, a loss that might otherwise render the assay uninformative as it is suppressible by dapk-1. C) A mutation in the gene encoding the DANGER-related protein MAB-21 does not affect nematode excitotoxicity. D) A mutation in the gene encoding the nematode homolog of CaMKK does not affect nematode excitotoxicity. We used two main guidelines in trying to track the mechanism by which dapk-1 regulates excitotoxic neurodegeneration in the nematode: 1) we looked at previous reports suggesting specific mechanisms for DAPK’s involvement in mammalian excitotoxicity; 2) we inferred from the general map of DAPK’s connectome in other cell processes [<18>] which additional proteins are plausible candidates for mediating DAPK’s effect in nematode excitotoxicity.

Mutations that reduce the activity of the general, common vesicle release mechanism (such as rab-3 [<48>]) cause a pronounced resistance to aldicarb (shifting the time-dependent paralysis curve to the right, Figure <2>A), while mutations that enhance synaptic release (such as the ko of cpx-1, which encodes the synaptic vesicle release regulator complexin [<49>]) cause increased sensitivity to aldicarb (shifting the paralysis curve to the left, Figure <2>A). We observed that the sensitivity of dapk-1 animals to aldicarb is indistinguishable from that of WT animals, suggesting that dapk-1 ko does not modify the synaptic release mechanism, as would have been expected of an effect on syntaxin (Figure <2>A).We next asked if DAPK modifies the extent of postsynaptic response in the glutamatergic synapses where excitotoxicity occurs (as reported in mammals, where DAPK was suggested to modify synaptic strength [<24>]). Two behavioral assays have proven very effective in detecting even small changes in the activity level of glutamatergic synapses in C. elegans. These are the Nose Touch (NOT) assay, and the duration of spontaneous forward mobility assay. Therefore, if dapk-1 ko causes changes in the specific Glu packaging mechanism in synaptic vesicles (e.g., by affecting vGluTs), or changes the number or activity-level of GluRs in the synapse, this should be reflected in behavioral changes in these assays. In the particular case of dapk-1, a secondary phenotype of this mutation, namely overgrowth of cuticle on the animal’s nose [<42>], makes the nose-touch assay less informative. However, the duration of spontaneous forward mobility depends on the internal balance between forward and backward circuits, and should not be affected by the cuticle aberration. This assay is very reliable in detecting both under-activity and over-activity of the relevant Glu synapses [<50>-<52>], allowing us to use it as a proxy measure for Glu synaptic strength. We did not observe any changes in spontaneous mobility triggered by dapk-1 ko, either in WT background or in the background of each of the two components (glt-3 or nuIs5) used in our excitotoxicity model to trigger the intensified Glu signaling (Figure <2>B). These observations suggest that dapk-1 has no strong effect on synaptic release or the overall strength of signaling in Glu synapses in C. elegans. The characterization of DAPK as a CaM-dependent kinase is particularly intriguing to us, since Ca2+ signaling is critical to excitotoxicity in both mammals and nematodes. We therefore examined DAPK-partners that might also be involved in Ca2+ signaling. DANGER is a mammalian DAPK inhibitor that regulates Ca2+ release from the ER [<22>,<23>]. There is no direct, full-length homolog of DANGER in the worm genome, but the core of the mammalian protein is thought to be homologous to the nematode protein MAB-21 [<53>]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that mab-21 will be essential to the role of a hypothetic DANGER-like complex in C. elegans. However, a mutation in mab-21 had no effect on nematode excitotoxicity (Figure <2>C). Another important protein that binds mammalian DAPK and is involved in Ca2+ signaling is CaMKK. However, again, a mutation in the only CaMKK gene in the worm, ckk-1 [<54>], had no effect on excitotoxicity (Figure <2>D). These results suggest that these two putative Ca2+ signaling regulators and DAPK-interaction-partners do not have a large contribution to nematode excitotoxicity.We also considered the many other proteins that are known to interact with DAPK [<18>] as possible modulators of excitotoxicity, but we could not assign to many of them high priority because either there was no immediate obvious connection to neurodegeneration (e.g., tropomyosin), there is no clear nematode homolog (e.g., NFκB), the nematode homolog is not known to be active in C. elegans neurons (e.g., p53), or the process in which this protein is involved has been shown by us to be not involved in nematode excitotoxicity (e.g., apoptosis [<41>]). However, DAPK is also known to interact with Beclin1, a key regulator of the evolutionary conserved process of autophagy, suggesting that autophagy-mediated cell death could potentially be an avenue for DAPK to regulate nematode excitotoxicity. The interaction between mammalian DAPK and Beclin1 is considered a major avenue for DAPK’s ability to regulate autophagy [<11>,<16>,<17>,<55>]. Autophagy has been suggested to be an important factor in some neurodegenerative conditions [<21>,<56>,<57>], and has also been shown to be a major contributor to degenerin-mediated neurodegeneration in the nematode [<58>-<60>] (where necrotic neurodegeneration is triggered by a constitutively open channel of the DEG/ENaC family [<61>]). Moreover, dapk-1 regulates autophagy in C. elegans [<43>]. We therefore set out to determine the role of autophagy in nematode excitotoxicity, using some of the same reagents used to demonstrate autophagy’s role in degenerin-induced neurodegeneration in the worm [<58>,<60>,<62>]. One such reagent is the red fluorescent labeled LC3 –homolog LGG-1 (originally created by the Tavernarakis lab [<62>], for the current study assigned the strain name IMN21). This reporter indicates elevated autophagy by both the appearance of intracellular puncta and by an overall increase in cellular fluorescence. We crossed IMN21 with our excitotoxicity strain glt-3;nuIs5."

We counted the number of at-risk neurons that show LGG-1 puncta and measured the overall intensity of DsRed::LGG-1 signal in these neurons. Since autophagy was reported to have a role in the low-level neurodegeneration caused by nuIs5 alone [<60>], we concentrated on the added effect of excitotoxicity by comparing DsRed::LGG-1 signals in animals that express only the sensitizing construct nuIs5 to those of animals in which neurons are subjected to the full excitotoxic insult (glt-3;nuIs5). We found that excitotoxicity resulted in only a small and statistically-insignificant increase in LGG-1 puncta, and no change in overall LGG-1 intensity in at-risk neurons (Figure <3>A and B). rhetorical Figure 3 A DsRed::LGG-1 reporter of autophagy does not provide convincing evidence for triggering of autophagy in at-risk neurons exposed to the excitotoxic insult.

We found that excitotoxicity resulted in only a small and statistically-insignificant increase in LGG-1 puncta, and no change in overall LGG-1 intensity in at-risk neurons (Figure <3>A and B).To further study the possible involvement of autophagy in nematode excitotoxicity we examined the effect of inhibiting autophagy by genetic and chemical means. While a number of mutations and drugs have been used in the past, not all of them are available to us here. For example, bec-1 ko was previously used to monitor the requirement of this autophagy regulator for mec-4(d) –induced necrosis in early development [<58>]. However, the lethal effect of this mutation in later development, when most of the nematode excitotoxic necrosis occurs, prevents us from using this approach. Similarly, the vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin is commonly used to block autophagy by elevating lysosomal pH [<63>]. However, the same V-ATPase is used in neurons to acidify synaptic vesicles as a means to provide the driving force for neurotransmitter loading [<64>-<66>], and therefore using bafilomycin can be expected to reduce neurotransmitter release. We therefore turned to use other means of intervention that are more compatible with our system: a mutation in the autophagy regulator unc-51 (using the e369 allele) and the chemical inhibitor 3MA (both used previously to show that degenerin-triggered neurodegeneration in C. elegans depends strongly on autophagy [<58>,<60>]). We noticed only a moderate effect for these two factors, evident in some developmental stages (Figure <4>A and B). Such a moderate effect is in line with the reported effect of unc-51 on nuIs5 alone [<60>] (see discussion). We then used an independent set of experiments and epistasis analysis to determine if this moderate effect works independently of dapk-1 or in the same pathway. We noticed that the effect of blocking autophagy on the extent of excitotoxicity is reproducible only in one developmental stage (L3). Trying to determine if dapk-1 and 3MA work in the same pathway, we compared their observed combined effect (in the dapk-1 + 3MA combination) to the calculated expected effect if these two processes were completely independent. However, given the moderate size of the 3MA effect and the inherent variability in our experiments, it is currently difficult to determine if dapk-1 and autophagy work in the same pathway or independently. Nonetheless, the fact that the effect of autophagy is much more limited in size and duration than that of dapk-1 supported a continued search for other mechanisms by which dapk-1 might regulate excitotoxicity. rhetorical Figure 4 Treatments that block autophagy (and dramatically reduce neurodegeneration in other forms of necrotic neurodegeneration in C. elegans) have a reproducible but small effect in nematode excitotoxicity. A) A mutation in unc-51 shows a moderate effect on nematode excitotoxicity. *p < 0.05 ; ***p < 0.01 B) Treatment with the autophagy-blocking drug 3MA has a moderate effect on nematode excitotoxicity. ***p < 0.01 C) Independent repetition of the experiment shown in B with the addition of epistasis analysis. The data shows that the only reproducible effect of autophagy blockade is in L3. Although at this stage the combined effect of autophagy blockade and dapk-1 correlates with a model of independent action of these two factors, the moderate extent of effects limits the strength of such a conclusion. The interaction between mammalian DAPK and Beclin1 is considered a major avenue for DAPK’s ability to regulate autophagy [<11>,<16>,<17>,<55>]. Autophagy has been suggested to be an important factor in some neurodegenerative conditions [<21>,<56>,<57>], and has also been shown to be a major contributor to degenerin-mediated neurodegeneration in the nematode [<58>-<60>] (where necrotic neurodegeneration is triggered by a constitutively open channel of the DEG/ENaC family [<61>]).

For example, bec-1 ko was previously used to monitor the requirement of this autophagy regulator for mec-4(d) –induced necrosis in early development [<58>]. However, the lethal effect of this mutation in later development, when most of the nematode excitotoxic necrosis occurs, prevents us from using this approach. Similarly, the vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin is commonly used to block autophagy by elevating lysosomal pH [<63>]. However, the same V-ATPase is used in neurons to acidify synaptic vesicles as a means to provide the driving force for neurotransmitter loading [<64>-<66>], and therefore using bafilomycin can be expected to reduce neurotransmitter release. We therefore turned to use other means of intervention that are more compatible with our system: a mutation in the autophagy regulator unc-51 (using the e369 allele) and the chemical inhibitor 3MA (both used previously to show that degenerin-triggered neurodegeneration in C. elegans depends strongly on autophagy [<58>,<60>]). We noticed only a moderate effect for these two factors, evident in some developmental stages (Figure <4>A and B). Such a moderate effect is in line with the reported effect of unc-51 on nuIs5 alone [<60>] (see discussion). We then used an independent set of experiments and epistasis analysis to determine if this moderate effect works independently of dapk-1 or in the same pathway. We noticed that the effect of blocking autophagy on the extent of excitotoxicity is reproducible only in one developmental stage (L3). Trying to determine if dapk-1 and 3MA work in the same pathway, we compared their observed combined effect (in the dapk-1 + 3MA combination) to the calculated expected effect if these two processes were completely independent. However, given the moderate size of the 3MA effect and the inherent variability in our experiments, it is currently difficult to determine if dapk-1 and autophagy work in the same pathway or independently. Nonetheless, the fact that the effect of autophagy is much more limited in size and duration than that of dapk-1 supported a continued search for other mechanisms by which dapk-1 might regulate excitotoxicity. Pin1 is an isomerase that changes the conformation of proline residues located next to phosphorylated Ser or Thr residues, thus changing overall protein conformation and controlling the activity of many phosphoproteins [<67>,<68>]. In recent years this protein has gained recognition as a major regulator of many signaling cascades, involved in both normal cell physiology, pathology, and in neurodegenerative diseases [<67>,<69>-<71>]. Pin1 is expressed in dendrites, its activity is modulated by Glu signaling, and it regulates PKCζ and PKMζ [<72>,<73>]. Pin1 is also known for its regulation of neuronal cytoskeleton and Tau protein phosphorylation, and for modulating neurodegeneration [<69>,<74>,<75>]. Recently, Pin1 was shown to functionally interact with DAPK [<76>]. We find that pinn-1 ko [<77>] causes increased neurodegeneration in nematode excitotoxicity (Figure <5>). Like dapk-1 ko, the effect of pinn-1 ko is seen in all developmental stages (Figure <5>A), and does not seem to involve a change in Glu synaptic strength (Figure <5>B and C), suggesting that they influence cell-death processes subsequent to- (and not at the level of-) GluR. rhetorical Figure 5 pinn-1 is an important suppressor of nematode excitotoxicity that does not affect basic synaptic strength.

pinn-1 does not affect the duration of spontaneous forward mobility or nose touch sensitivity, two sensitive measures of Glu synaptic strength.

Given the stochastic nature of neurodegeneration in glt-3;nuIs5 animals, it is usually difficult to identify which of the ~30 at-risk head neurons are degenerating in different animals. To circumvent this difficulty, we address the survival of specific neurons by focusing on the easily identifiable RIG neurons. The RIG neurons are part of the group of at-risk head neurons, they show only very minor levels of neurodegeneration in nuIs5 alone, and they are sensitive to all the treatments that modify total head neuron degeneration analyzed in our previous studies [<37>,<40>,<41>]. Indeed, RIG neurons exhibit inverse correlation between the number of vacuole-like structures they show during development (as observed by Nomarski) and the number of GFP-labeled RIG neurons surviving in the adult [<37>]. We now confirm that the number of degenerating RIG neurons during development is reduced by dapk-1 ko and increased by pinn-1 ko (data not shown). Importantly, we find that the number of GFP-labeled RIG neurons that survive to adulthood is increased by dapk-1 ko and decreased by pinn-1 ko (Figure <6>B)."

A) Epistasis analysis testing the involvement of dapk-1 and pinn-1 in nematode excitotoxicity.

B) Verification that the effects of dapk-1 and pinn-1 mutations on the dynamics of overall neurodegeneration in head neurons translates to survival of identified neurons in the adult (counting surviving GFP-labeled RIG neurons in young adult animals).

The RIG neurons are part of the group of at-risk head neurons, they show only very minor levels of neurodegeneration in nuIs5 alone, and they are sensitive to all the treatments that modify total head neuron degeneration analyzed in our previous studies [<37>,<40>,<41>].

Importantly, we find that the number of GFP-labeled RIG neurons that survive to adulthood is increased by dapk-1 ko and decreased by pinn-1 ko (Figure <6>B). These observations suggest that the effects of dapk-1 and pinn-1 on vacuolar appearance during development indeed translate to changes in ultimate survival of identified neurons.Finally, we wanted to determine if dapk-1 (where a KO causes decreased neurodegeneration) and pinn-1 (where a KO causes increased neurodegeneration) work in the same or separate pathways. Mammalian studies suggest that DAPK is acting upstream of Pin1 to inhibit its function [<76>], so that KO of pinn-1 could be expected to exert its death-stimulating effect regardless of whether dapk-1 is present or not. Instead, using epistasis analysis (Figure <6>A), we observe that the double knockout dapk-1 ; pinn-1 exhibited suppression of excitotoxicity. We tried to further determine if the effect of dapk-1; pinn-1 double knockout reflects an intermediate outcome (in line with an independent, parallel effect of these two factors) or a dapk-1 ko –only-like outcome (in line with an obligatory sequential effect, where the dapk-1 mutation-induced decrease in neurodegeneration completely masks the ability of pinn-1 mutation to increase neurodegeneration). To that end we calculated what would be the effect of these two factors acting in parallel, to predict their cumulative independent effect (Figure <6>A). Unfortunately, the small difference between the observed effect of dapk-1 alone and the calculated independent cumulative effects of dapk-1 and pinn-1, together with the variability in our data, do not allow us to discriminate with confidence between these two options. We therefore limit our conclusion to say that dapk-1 acts either downstream or in parallel to- (but not upstream of-) pinn-1 in nematode excitotoxicity. Mammalian studies have generated a plethora of proposed mechanisms in excitotoxicity, and some of these studies include suggested pathways for the involvement of DAPK in critical cell death events. However, the significance of these proposed mechanisms across divergent excitotoxic conditions remains unclear. In our study we focused on a glutamate-dependent neuronal death in C. elegans and examined a set of candidate mechanisms to define those that might be conserved through a large evolutionary distance. We previously found that some core constitutes of excitotoxicity are well conserved in our nematode model of GluT KO –triggered and CPAR-mediated neuronal necrosis. These include both death-promoting factors (such as release of Ca2+ from the ER [<37>]), and neuroprotective factors (such as cell stress resistance to insults, resistance that is conferred by FoxO/DAF-16 [<40>,<41>]). We now report that DAPK is also a highly conserved regulator of excitotoxicity (Figure <1>A and B), though we note that dapk-1 ko does not bring neurodegeneration all the way down to background levels. We find no evidence for dapk-1 –mediated regulation of synaptic strength, as defined by the spontaneous mobility assay (Figure <2>B), suggesting that the effect of DAPK on mammalian NR2B/GluN2B, though probably very important, does not extend to all forms of excitotoxicity. We also found no role for the DANGER-related protein MAB-21 in nematode excitotoxicity (though DANGER is a much larger protein than MAB-21, suggesting it might have additional functions not tested here).Although dapk-1 is an important regulator of autophagy in C. elegans, we find only a minor role for autophagy in the neurodegenerative condition we study in glt-3;nuIs5 animals. We find that blocking autophagy has a relatively small neurodegeneration-reducing effect (~0.5-1 dying neuron/animal, Figure <4>). This effect is smaller than the neurodegeneration-suppressing effect of dapk-1 ko (a decrease of ~2.5 dying neurons/animal, three independent isolates counted in Figures <1>A, <4>C, and <6>A). Therefore, even if related, autophagy cannot account for the majority of DAPK’s effect in glt-3;nuIs5 animals. The minor effect of autophagy on neurodegeneration in glt-3;nuIs5 is in sharp contrast to the major effect that autophagy has on degenerin-mediated neurodegeneration, where it suppresses neurodegeneration by 75-90% [<60>]. We further note that these previous studies have demonstrated that blocking autophagy decreases the extent of low-level neurodegeneration triggered by nuIs5 alone [<60>]. Since neurodegeneration by nuIs5 alone (independent of excitotoxicity) is part of the total number of degenerating neurons we count in our assay (accounting for ~1 dying neuron/animal [<37>]), the small effect of autophagy seen in the current study can be attributed to its documented effect of nuIs5 alone."
PMC4414438_6,"Indeed, we see no significant difference in labeling of fluorescent autophagy reporter when comparing nuIs5 to glt-3;nuIs5 animals (Figure <3>)  The results of epistasis analysis are not conclusive, but put together with the difference in size and timing of the effects of dapk-1 and autophagy on nematode excitotoxicity, our observations cause us to favor one of the possible models in which autophagy has only a minor role in nematode excitotoxicity in parallel to the role of DAPK-1 (Figure <6>C). We emphasize that the parallel action of DAPK and autophagy is preferred by us in the specific scenario of nematode excitotoxic stress, while other stresses might include DAPK and autophagy in other pathway configurations.The observation that the DAPK-interaction-partner Pin1/PINN-1 is a significant regulator of excitotoxicity is particularly intriguing and novel. In addition to its involvement in cancer [<71>] and stress response [<78>], Pin1 has been shown to be a critical regulator of dendritic Glu responses [<72>,<73>] and of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease [<69>,<74>,<75>]. The results of our epistasis analysis do not seem to support a role for Pin1/PINN-1 as an obligatory step downstream of DAPK/DAPK-1, as might be inferred from mammalian cancer studies [<76>]. Instead, our data supports that PINN-1 acts in parallel or upstream of DAPK-1 (Figure <6>A and C). Put together, our study suggests that nematode excitotoxicity can be an important tool to sift through many proposed mechanisms of excitotoxicity, allowing us to identify conserved mechanisms that might be at the core of neurodegenerative processes common across divergent excitotoxic scenarios. Furthermore, our studies now illuminate DAPK/DAPK-1 and Pin1/PINN-1 as two such factors, important for excitotoxicity mechanisms across a large evolutionary distance. We can now further use this system to decipher DAPK-1 and PINN-1 –related mechanisms in nematode excitotoxicity, with the hope that such understanding might help us to continue uncovering conserved core mechanisms in this important form of neurodegeneration. The following C. elegans strains were obtained from the C. elegans Genetic Center (CGC), from the Japanese National Bioresource Project (NBSP), or from the original producers: WT: Bristol N2 (RRID:CGC_N2 (ancestral)); Nematode excitotoxicity model: ZB1102: glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V; (RRID:CGC_ZB1102) dapk-1: VC432: dapk-1(gk219) I; (RRID:CGC_VC432) dapk-1 over-expression: CZ9277:frIs7[Pnlp-29::GFP; Pcol-12:DsRed] (IV); juEx1933[Phsp16::DAPK-1; Pttx-3::RFP] (the frIs7 insertion was later eliminated during our cross); Aldicarb assay control strains: sv-hyper-releasing/aldicarb-oversensitive RB1367: cpx-1(ok1552) (RRID:CGC_RB1367); sv-under-releasing/aldicarb-resistant NM791: rab-3(js49) (RRID:CGC_NM791): Autophagy modulatorunc-51: CB369: unc-51(e369) V (RRID:CGC_CB369); Autophagy label, DsRed::LGG-1: (originally created by the Tavernarakis lab [<62>], strain naming here as per BMC policy) IMN21: N2; Ex [Plgg-1:: DsRed:: LGG-1; Pmyo-2:: GFP]; Glu-regulated mobility defective control: VM1268: nmr-1(ak4) II; glr-2(ak10) glr-1(ky176) III;DANGER-related protein MAB-21: EM128: mab-21(bx53) III (Q203* , CAG -- > UAG) (RRID:CGC_EM128).CaMKK-like KO: ckk-1(ok1033) III (RRID:CGC_VC691);Pin1-like KO:pinn-1(tm2235) II (this 364 bp deletion runs the ORF into a stop codon after 8 codons). Most crosses were followed by PCR analysis to detect deletions, and by monitoring nuIs5’s GFP expression in glr-1-expressing interneurons using a high power fluorescence dissecting scope. dapk-1 over-expressing construct juEx1933 was followed by its coinjection marker, which produces RFP expression on AIY neurons. The unc-51 mutation was followed by uncoordinated phenotype and sequencing. DsRed::LGG-1 was followed by DsRed expression in cells throughout the body and by GFP expression in the pharynx (from the myo-2 promoter). We constructed the following strains: dapk-1 in excitotoxicity (by crossing VC432 and ZB1102) IMN26: dapk-1(gk219) I; glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V;DAPK-1 overexpression in excitotoxicity (by crossing ZB1102 and CZ9277) IMN25: glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V; juEx1933 [Phsp16::DAPK-1; Pttx-3::RFP]; Autophagy suppression in excitotoxicity (by crossing ZB1102 and CB369) IMN22: glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 , unc-51(e369) V;Autophagy reporter in excitotoxicity IMN24: glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V; Ex[Plgg-1:: DsRed:: LGG-1; Pmyo-2:: GFP];CaMKK deletion in excitotoxicity:ckk-1 (ok1033) III; glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V.DANGER-like deletion in excitotoxicity: (by crossing EM128 and ZB1102): mab-21(bx53) III; glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V; Pin1-like deletion in excitotoxicity: IMN30: pinn-1(tm2235) II; glt-3(bz34) IV ; nuIs5 V (± dapk-1(gk219) I). The level of necrotic neurodegeneration in head neurons was monitored using an inverted scope and Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast (DIC). Animals with no anesthetics were examined on a fresh chunk of agar of nematode culture flipped upside down over a slide. Swollen “vacuolated-looking” cells located in the area of the nerve ring were counted as head neurons undergoing necrosis, as described previously [<37>,<41>]. Briefly, we use freshly growing mixed-stage animals, and we record the developmental stage and the number of “vacuolated” dying neurons of each animal that we see while scanning through the agar chunk, thus creating a “snap-shot” of the transitory number of dying neurons exhibited by the population of animals at the time of analysis. As mentioned above, in the excitotoxicity strain the number of “vacuolated” cells observed at each developmental stage typically goes up until L3 (with the maturation of Glu signaling in the worm), and then declines with the engulfment of cell copses. This analysis is repeated several times, with several isolates of each strain. For confirmation of suspected effects in new mutant combinations, a representative part of the analysis is done blindly by independent observers. Similar numbers of control and test animals are recorded in each session. Records from all these sessions is pooled together to calculate average neurodegeneration from large number of animals in each strain and each stage (50–200 in each data bar). We occasionally confirmed these dying neurons as neurons postsynaptic to Glu connections by verifying their labeling with the GFP co-expressed in nuIs5 animals under the glr-1 promoter. For heat-shock-induced overexpression of DAPK-1, animals carrying [Phsp16::DAPK-1; Pttx-3::RFP] were placed in a 35°C incubator for 2 hours to induce activation of heat shock promoter, left to rest for about 30 minutes and scored regularly for two days for the extent of swollen degenerating neurons (protocol & strains coordinated with the Chisholm group, UCSD [<42>]). Experimental animals (animals with extrachromosomal array) and control animals (animals lacking extrachromosomal array) were obtained, identified and scored on the same day from the same pool of heat-shocked animals. For epistasis analysis between given excitotoxicity-modifying mutations X and Y, we calculated the effect of each mutation for each developmental stage as: Fold effect of X = (the average number of dying head neuron in the excitotoxicity strain in the presence of mutation X)/(the average number of dying head neuron in the starting excitotoxicity strain), with a similar calculation for mutation Y. The expected cumulative fold effect of mutations X and Y when working independently in parallel pathways is (fold effect of X) * (fold effect of Y). The calculated expected number of dying neurons presented on the graphs in Figures <4> and <6> is (the average number of dying head neuron in the starting excitotoxicity strain) * (fold effect of X) * (fold effect of Y). Error bars represent SE. Statistical significance of difference between control groups and experimental groups was analyzed using z-test score (as the significance of these differences is calculated for large populations of ~100 animals in each group)."
PMC4414438_7,"Animals carrying Ex [Plgg-1:: DsRed:: LGG-1; Pmyo-2:: GFP]; glt-3(bz34) IV; nuIs5 V and Ex [Plgg-1:: DsRed:: LGG-1; Pmyo-2:: GFP]; nuIs5 V were analyzed for the extent to which glr-1 expressing command interneuron (labeled with GFP) were undergoing autophagy (i e., show DsRed punca or increased DsRed intensity). Animals were mounted on a 2% agar pad. To compare average DsRed intensity between worms we identified the cell with the highest DsRed intensity as 100% and then compared the other neurons to this cell (following the procedure used by the Tavernarakis lab, who developed this DsRed::LGG-1 marker [<62>]). A few cells were analyzed in each animal and the average intensity from a total from 20–25 animals was calculated. We also counted the average of the number of green-labeled neurons showing DsRed puncta as another indication of neurons undergoing autophagy and compared control (nuIs5 only) versus experimental (glt-3; nuIs5) groups. For 3-methyladenine (3MA) treatment, mixed stage animals from the excitotoxicity strain (glt-3; nuIs5) or the DAPK-inhibited excitotoxicity strain (dapk-1; glt-3; nuIs5) were incubated overnight with 10 mM 3-MA (Sigma, M9281) dissolved in 1% DMSO (experimental group) or 1% DMSO alone (control). Plates were supplemented with E. coli OP50. The extent of neurodegeneration was recorded 20–24 h after treatment. Behavioral assays on nematode locomotion and worm paralysis were performed blindly following standard methods of behavioral analysis. For duration of Glu-regulated spontaneous forward mobility we followed the protocol of the Maricq group (U Utah) [<79>]. We did not measure mobility in strains that show excitotoxic neurodegeneration because the degeneration or rescue of command interneurons can change the results of this assay. For aldicarb assays we followed the Nonet lab protocol (Washington U) [<48>]. Briefly, we soaked worm plates with aldicarb to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and added food. We placed ~30 freshly growing young adult animal onto these plates. The percentages of paralyzed worms were recorded every 15 minutes for a period of 2 hours. Excitotoxicity (the toxic overstimulation of neurons by the excitatory transmitter Glutamate) is a central process in widespread neurodegenerative conditions such as brain ischemia and chronic neurological diseases. Many mechanisms have been suggested to mediate excitotoxicity, but their significance across diverse excitotoxic scenarios remains unclear. Death Associated Protein Kinase (DAPK), a critical molecular switch that controls a range of key signaling and cell death pathways, has been suggested to have an important role in excitotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism by which DAPK exerts its effect is controversial. A few distinct mechanisms have been suggested by single (sometimes contradicting) studies, and a larger array of potential mechanisms is implicated by the extensive interactome of DAPK. Here we analyze a well-characterized model of excitotoxicity in the nematode C. elegans to show that DAPK is an important mediator of excitotoxic neurodegeneration across a large evolutionary distance. We further show that some proposed mechanisms of DAPK’s action (modulation of synaptic strength, involvement of the DANGER-related protein MAB-21, and autophagy) do not have a major role in nematode excitotoxicity. In contrast, Pin1/PINN-1 (a DAPK interaction-partner and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase involved in chronic neurodegenerative conditions) suppresses neurodegeneration in our excitotoxicity model. Our studies highlight the prominence of DAPK and Pin1/PINN-1 as conserved mediators of cell death processes in diverse scenarios of neurodegeneration. ."
PMC5712583_0,"The pathological aggregation of tau protein is a hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. Tau aggregates independently in each neuron, but this aggregation can also occur in a non-cell autonomous manner in which aggregated tau is transmitted from one cell to another. Such trans-cellular propagation is initiated by the uptake of extracellular tau, which then seeds soluble tau in the recipient cells to spread the tau pathology. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that tau is not only present in the cytoplasm of neurons but also actively released into the extracellular space. This finding has led to the idea that extracellular tau could be a novel therapeutic target to halt the propagation of tau pathology. From this perspective, the present review article focuses on recent advances in understanding the mechanisms regulating the levels of extracellular tau and discusses the role of such mechanisms in the propagation of tau pathology. The abnormal accumulation of tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles is the common pathological hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), that are collectively referred to as tauopathies. The deposition of neurofibrillary tangles highly correlates with cognitive decline in AD, suggesting that tau plays a critical role in neurodegeneration (Gómez-Isla et al., <1997>). Tau is intrinsically highly soluble; however, in tauopathies, it self-assembles into fibrillar aggregates. This process involves a nucleation and elongation mechanism where tau first forms small intermediate oligomers that convert normally folded tau into misfolded aggregates by acting as aggregation nuclei or seeds (hereinafter referred to as “seed-competent tau”). Such nucleation-dependent aggregation was thought to occur only in a cell-autonomous manner, but compelling evidence now suggests that non-cell autonomous aggregation can also occur via seed-competent tau transmission from neurons to neurons via the extracellular space. The present review article discusses recent knowledge about the roles of extracellular tau including trans-cellular propagation, the possible mechanisms that regulate its extracellular levels, and the pathological implications of those mechanisms in tauopathies. Tau is well-recognized for its role in assembling/stabilizing microtubules although tau single knockout mice do not show major phenotypic changes in neuronal microtubule stability because of a putative functional redundancy (Takei et al., <2000>). Due to this interaction with microtubules, its localization has been long assumed to be restricted to the cytoplasm of neurons. However, accumulating evidence now demonstrates that tau is also physiologically present in the extracellular fluid. Tau is present in full-length (Karch et al., <2013>) or truncated forms (Bright et al., <2015>; Kanmert et al., <2015>) not only in the culture media of cells over-expressing human tau (Chai et al., <2012>), primary neurons (Karch et al., <2012>), and iPSC derived neurons (Chai et al., <2012>; Bright et al., <2015>) but also in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice (Yamada et al., <2011>) and human (Magnoni et al., <2012>).Although the physiological function of extracellular tau still remains unclear, extracellular tau currently receives considerable attention due to its role in trans-cellular propagation. Tau propagation was initially described in cell culture models where the extracellular application of tau fibrils enters the cells and robustly seeds aggregation of the soluble tau expressed in cells (Frost et al., <2009>). Such a seeding effect was not observed when soluble monomeric tau was applied. Subsequent studies have shown that injecting tau fibrils into the brain also induces trans-neuronal propagation in vivo (Clavaguera et al., <2009>; Iba et al., <2013>). In cell culture studies, the transfer of conditioned media from cells with aggregates was sufficient to induce aggregation in the recipient cells (Kfoury et al., <2012>; Wu et al., <2016>), suggesting that seed-competent tau is released into the culture media. It remains uncertain that trans-cellular propagation also contributes to the progression of tau pathology in human (Walsh and Selkoe, <2016>): nonetheless, seeding activity detected in human CSF using sensitive assays such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) analysis (Saijo et al., <2017>) or tau biosensor cells (Holmes et al., <2014>; Takeda et al., <2016>) supports this tau spreading hypothesis.In addition to being trans-cellularly propagated, tau may have specific functions in the extracellular space. For example, the application of extracellular tau increases the electrical activity of iPSC-derived or primary cortical neurons (Bright et al., <2015>). Moreover, extracellular tau may elicit cellular toxicity under certain conditions. The addition of tau into the cell culture media binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and increases intracellular calcium, eventually leading to cell death (Gómez-Ramos et al., <2006>, <2008>). Furthermore, extracellular oligomeric tau impairs memory and long-term potentiation (LTP) in mice (Fá et al., <2016>; Puzzo et al., <2017>). However, in some experimental models, the amount of tau needed to elicit impairment is far more than the circulating levels of tau; thus, further investigation is needed to determine whether aforementioned effects indeed reflect the pathophysiological function of extracellular tau. The amount of soluble monomeric tau released from cells is altered by the various types of external stimuli. For example, starvation or lysosomal dysfunction increases tau release (Mohamed et al., <2014>). In addition, stimulating neuronal activity in either cultured neurons or in vivo also enhances tau release (Pooler et al., <2013>; Yamada et al., <2014>; Fá et al., <2016>). Given that extracellular tau influences neuronal activity (Bright et al., <2015>), this observation suggests that the activity-dependent release of tau participates in a positive feedback loop on neuronal activity.Differences in tau species or isoforms also impact its release. For example, extracellular tau levels are differentially altered by the presence of mutations in MAPT, an amino-terminal insertion sequence, or a repeat domain (Karch et al., <2012>). Moreover, hyperphosphorylation-mimicking mutant tau is preferentially released while extracellular tau is rather less phosphorylated compared to intracellular tau (Plouffe et al., <2012>; Bright et al., <2015>). Furthermore, caspase-3 cleavage at D421 increases tau release (Plouffe et al., <2012>). These observations of variable tau release suggest the presence of active cellular mechanisms regulating its release.Tau does not contain an apparent signal peptide sequence to regulate its trans-location to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for conventional secretory pathway, thus, it remains to be elucidated how tau reaches the extracellular space. In addition to tau, an increasing number of proteins without a signal peptide sequence are being recognized for their unexpected release into the extracellular space. Such secretion is termed unconventional protein secretion and occurs via vesicular or non-vesicular pathways.One of the best-characterized mechanisms for unconventional vesicular secretion is the exosome-dependent pathway. Exosomes are the extracellular vesicles that are released upon fusion of the multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Tau from the CSF (Saman et al., <2012>) and blood of patients with AD (Fiandaca et al., <2015>) is associated with exosomes. N2a cells over-expressing tau (Wang et al., <2017>) and microglia also release tau in an exosome-dependent manner (Asai et al., <2015>). However, other studies show that the majority of extracellular tau is membrane-free (Chai et al., <2012>; Karch et al., <2012>) and not associated with extracellular vesicles such as exosomes or ectosomes (i.e., plasma-membrane originating vesicles) (Dujardin et al., <2014>)."
PMC5712583_1,"Therefore, the exosome-dependent mechanism may only explain a small fraction of the total tau that is released into the extracellular space Current understanding of exosome-independent tau release mechanisms is limited, however, chaperones and proteins responsible for intracellular vesicle trafficking have been implicated. For example, DnaJ/Hsc70 chaperone complexes control the release of tau and knockdown of SNAP23, a SNARE protein involved in vesicle-mediated exocytosis, blocks tau release (Fontaine et al., <2016>). Interestingly, a significant portion of endogenous tau in neurons is associated with membrane fractions and membrane-associated tau is largely dephosphorylated, like extracellular tau (Pooler et al., <2012>). Although the identity of membrane-associated tau remains to be clarified, it is tempting to speculate that tau is translocated into intracellular vesicles prior to its release.Rab GTPase regulates various steps of intracellular vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. Rab7a (Rodriguez et al., <2017>) and Rab1a (Mohamed et al., <2017>) have been recently implicated in tau release, further suggesting that tau release involves vesicle transport. Elucidating the precise molecular mechanism involving these proteins will uncover release pathway in more detail.Some substrates such as fibroblast growth factor 2 are secreted via the unconventional secretion pathway by direct translocation across the plasma membrane (La Venuta et al., <2015>). Tau also interacts with plasma membrane via amino terminal projection domain (Brandt et al., <1995>), which is influenced by a tauopathy-associated mutation (Gauthier-Kemper et al., <2011>). Nevertheless, there is no evidence to date that tau is also released through such a non-vesicular secretion pathway.The majority of tau binds to microtubules (Weissmann et al., <2009>), thus one might speculate that detachment of tau from microtubules increase releasable pool of tau. However, the relationship between tau release and interaction with microtubules is not understood well. To date, there is no clear demonstration that microtubule binding properties directly influence tau release. The stabilization or destabilization of microtubules with paclitaxel or pseudolaric acid B both increased tau release (Karch et al., <2012>). This may be the consequence of altered homeostasis of tau by perturbation of microtubule binding. How the release of tau is related to its dynamic kiss-and-hop interaction with microtubules needs further investigation.Finally, the majority of current literature only describes the release of soluble monomeric tau and there is little definitive evidence of whether and how seed-competent tau is released into the extracellular space. Soluble monomeric tau and seed-competent tau may exit cells via distinct pathways. Because tau aggregates that leak from dying or degenerating neurons also likely mediate transcellular propagation, further studies are needed to investigate whether there are active release mechanisms for seed-competent tau from living cells. Extracellular tau levels are maintained based on a balance between cellular release and clearance; thus, changes in clearance will also affect extracellular tau levels. A study of regulatable tau transgenic mice found a relatively low turnover rate of ISF tau (the expected half-life was ~11–17 days) (Yamada et al., <2015>); nonetheless, the molecular mechanism for clearing extracellular tau remains largely uninvestigated.The paravascular clearance pathway, also termed the “glymphatic system,” has been recently recognized for its critical role in eliminating extracellular molecules from the brain via perivascular tunnels (Iliff et al., <2012>). This pathway may participate in tau clearance, as tau accumulates along the veins upon injection into the brain (Iliff et al., <2014>).Uptake and degradation of seed-competent tau by glial cells may inhibit propagation by blocking neuronal uptake. Anti-tau antibodies facilitate microglial uptake of tau aggregates (Funk et al., <2015>; Luo et al., <2015>; Yanamandra et al., <2015>). In addition to microglia-mediated degradation, a brain-to-blood clearance pathway may play a role. A study has shown that tau injected into the CSF appeared in plasma and underwent degradation (Yanamandra et al., <2017>). Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, these data suggest the presence of pathway that eliminates extracellular tau from the CNS to the peripheral bloodstream. Accumulating evidence suggests that tau is physiologically released into the extracellular space independently of cell death or neurodegeneration. This evidence suggests the novel possibility that tau may play pivotal extracellular roles. Given that tau propagation is mediated by extracellular seed-competent tau, a possible therapeutic intervention strategy is to reduce such pathological tau levels in the extracellular space. However, such a strategy may interfere with the yet-to-be-identified physiological functions of normal extracellular tau.Elevated CSF tau is a diagnostic biomarker in AD patients (Tapiola et al., <2009>). The physiological presence of extracellular tau may challenge the view that this elevation merely reflects the degree of neurodegeneration. Notably, CSF tau levels begin to increase during the period when a significant neuronal loss would not be expected (Bateman et al., <2012>). Consistent with this observation, CSF tau in APP transgenic mice is increased in an age-dependent manner without a global neuronal loss (Maia et al., <2013>).Elucidating the precise mechanisms regulating extracellular tau levels, especially mechanisms involving prior to neurodegeneration, will lead to important new insights to better understand the physiological/pathological roles of tau in the brain and improve the diagnosis and treatment of tauopathies. The author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and approved it for publication. The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. The pathological aggregation of tau protein is a hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. Tau aggregates independently in each neuron, but this aggregation can also occur in a non-cell autonomous manner in which aggregated tau is transmitted from one cell to another. Such trans-cellular propagation is initiated by the uptake of extracellular tau, which then seeds soluble tau in the recipient cells to spread the tau pathology. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that tau is not only present in the cytoplasm of neurons but also actively released into the extracellular space. This finding has led to the idea that extracellular tau could be a novel therapeutic target to halt the propagation of tau pathology. From this perspective, the present review article focuses on recent advances in understanding the mechanisms regulating the levels of extracellular tau and discusses the role of such mechanisms in the propagation of tau pathology. ."
PMC5656431_0,"Genetic analysis has revealed that the dual specificity protein kinase DYRK1A has multiple roles in the development of the central nervous system. Increased DYRK1A gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, is known to affect neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of DYRK1A, we show here that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of DYRK1A interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. Specifically, DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of the absence or haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A on early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for DYRK1A in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells.

AGE and EGS are Senior Research Fellows of the NHMRC. The dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated (Dyrk) kinases belong to a family collectively referred to as CMGC kinases (<Aranda et al., 2011>) that includes cyclin dependent kinases, mitogen associated protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinases, and cyclin dependent-like kinases The distinguishing biochemical features of Dyrk kinases are their ability to phosphorylate serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, and the autoregulation of their kinase activity through tyrosine phosphorylation. The five mammalian Dyrk kinases are divided into two classes. The Class 1 kinase DYRK1A has been implicated in a diverse variety of biological processes, including central nervous system development, Down syndrome, cancer, beta cell proliferation and diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease, and the discovery of novel DYRK1A inhibitors has been a goal of many recent studies (<Abbassi et al., 2015>; <Aranda et al., 2011>; <Shen et al., 2015>; <Smith et al., 2012>; <Stotani et al., 2016>).DYRK1A has multiple roles in central nervous system development (<Tejedor and Hämmerle, 2011>). Genetic studies in mice (<Fotaki et al., 2002>) and man (<Bronicki et al., 2015>; <Courcet et al., 2012>; <Dang et al., 2017>; <DDD Study et al., 2017>; <Ji et al., 2015>; <Møller et al., 2008>; <van Bon et al., 2016>; <Yamamoto et al., 2011>) have revealed that haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A can lead to severe disorders of brain development, including microcephaly, as well as a generalized developmental delay. DYRK1A lies within the Down syndrome critical region on chromosome 21, and an excessive gene dosage of DYRK1A is thought to account for some of the central nervous system phenotypes of this disorder (<Duchon and Herault, 2016>). Studies of DYRK1A overexpression have elucidated some of its functions during neurogenesis. In embryonic neuroepithelium, a transient increase in DYRK1A expression results in the cessation of the proliferative divisions that expand the progenitor compartment, and premature entry of these cells into a pro-differentiation neurogenic pathway (<Hämmerle et al., 2011>). In several model systems, DYRK1A overexpression led to exit of neural stem cells from the cell cycle, through mechanisms involving cyclin D1 and p53 (<Najas et al., 2015>; <Park et al., 2010>; <Soppa et al., 2014>; <Yabut et al., 2010>). DYRK1A gene dosage also affects later stages of neurogenesis, including neuronal dendritogenesis (<Benavides-Piccione et al., 2005>; <Göckler et al., 2009>). DYRK1A has also been implicated in tau protein phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (<Coutadeur et al., 2015>).Previously we showed that the indole derivative ID-8, in combination with WNT3A, could maintain human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in long-term culture under defined conditions in the absence of exogenous activators of the nodal or FGF signalling pathways, both of which are generally considered to be essential for human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) maintenance (<Hasegawa et al., 2012>). In the presence of WNT3A, ID-8 modestly enhanced hESC plating efficiency, and strongly inhibited the induction of lineage specific differentiation genes normally observed following WNT treatment of undifferentiated stem cells. Using affinity chromatography, we found that ID-8 bound to Dyrk family members DYRK2 and DYRK4 in extracts of human pluripotent stem cells. We further showed that stable knockdown of DYRK1A and DYRK2 caused a modest increase in the plating efficiency of hESC, but we did not establish whether this effect was related to enhancement of attachment and survival, or to inhibition of differentiation. Thus although these studies suggested an important action of ID-8 on hESC through modulation of Dyrk kinase activity, the actual molecular target of the compound related to its specific biologic activities remained unclear.In this study we examine the biological activity of ID-8 and a related series of novel indole compounds to determine the role of Dyrk kinase inhibition in stem cell regulation. Human kinome screening, structure activity relationships and targeted gene activation and inactivation studies implicate DYRK1A as the biologically significant target of ID-8. We show that DYRK1A inhibition results in a block to neural specification of human embryonic stem cells. This block is not a uniform response across the entire hPSC population, but instead reflects the ability of DYRK1A inhibitors to insulate the self-renewing subpopulation of hESC from powerful differentiation induction signals. We consider these results in the context of stem cell fate determination, and the deleterious effects of DYRK1A loss on central nervous system development. We examined the specificity of kinase inhibition by ID-8 (<Figure 1a>) and a related series of novel indole compounds using a biochemical in vitro assay. ID-8 was screened against a panel of 339 human protein kinases by measuring incorporation of radioactive ATP into appropriate substrates (Reaction Biology). Activity (based on percentage inhibition at a 10 μM dose of ID-8) against the top ten protein kinase targets, and several members of the CMGC family, are listed in <Figure 1b>. The specificity of the compound is displayed in a kinome inhibition map in <Figure 1c> (for the complete results of the screen, see <Supplementary file 1>). ID-8 indeed showed selectivity against the CMGC kinase family, with DYRK1B, GSK3B and DYRK1A being the top three kinase targets. Although a biotinylated derivative of ID-8 bound DYRK2 and DYRK4 in affinity chromatography pull down assays (<Hasegawa et al., 2012>), ID-8 itself showed little activity against these kinases, or against DYRK3. Next we determined IC50 values for a subset of these kinase targets, using the same 33P incorporation assay (<Table 1>). This study revealed the high specificity of ID-8 for DYRK1A and DYRK1B, and confirmed a lack of activity against DYRK2 and DYRK4. Inhibition of PIM1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and CLK4 at IC50 values between 280–450 nM was also observed. rhetorical Figure 1. (A) ID-8 structure.

The 1 and 6 positions were targeted because modelling studies (discussed below) implicated the –OH and –OCH3 groups as critical to binding at the active site of DYRK1A. The NO2 group was modified since this group might lead to unwanted pharmacological properties in vivo, such as metabolic conversion to toxic nitroso or hydroxylamine derivatives. These compounds were prepared using: (1) the Nenitzescu reaction used for the preparation of ID-8 itself (for compounds 48 and 49); (2) by derivatization of ID-8 (for compounds 28, 29, 30, 34, 35); or (3) by Fischer indole synthesis (compounds 38 and 51).

In our previous study (<Hasegawa et al., 2012>), we established that ID-8 treatment modestly increased the replating efficiency of hESC. This effect was further enhanced by addition of WNT3A. WNT3A alone promoted propagation of hESC, but also strongly induced expression of differentiation markers. The addition of ID-8 to WNT3A- treated cells partially suppressed the induction of differentiation markers seen in the presence of WNT3A alone. We therefore first investigated the effects of ID-8 alone on hESC cultured under conditions that promote self-renewal. Propagation of hESC in the presence of ID-8 did not affect the cell cycle distribution of hESC (<Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b>), or the overall distribution of the proportion of cells in the culture bearing stem cell surface markers (<Figure 2—figure supplement 1c>). There was no consistent inhibition of apoptosis by ID-8 (data not shown).Since we observed previously that the most striking effect of ID-8 on hESC was to inhibit the expression of early lineage specification markers induced by WNT3A, we decided to investigate the effects of the compound on lineage specification in more depth, and to assess the role of DYRK1A inhibition in this effect. Given the importance of DYRK1A in the development of the nervous system, we chose to examine the effects of ID-8 and its homologues on early neural specification in hESC. We used the combined inhibition of BMP and nodal/activin signalling (<Chambers et al., 2009>) to induce neural specification, and assayed the conversion of hESC to neural progenitors by flow cytometry using a PAX6 reporter cell line developed in our laboratories (<Figure 2a>, <Figure 2—figure supplement 2>, and Materials and methods). rhetorical Figure 2.

Given the importance of DYRK1A in the development of the nervous system, we chose to examine the effects of ID-8 and its homologues on early neural specification in hESC. We used the combined inhibition of BMP and nodal/activin signalling (<Chambers et al., 2009>) to induce neural specification, and assayed the conversion of hESC to neural progenitors by flow cytometry using a PAX6 reporter cell line developed in our laboratories (<Figure 2a>, <Figure 2—figure supplement 2>, and Materials and methods). rhetorical Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

However, we observed a clear morphological difference between control cells that had been induced with dual SMAD only versus cells that also received ID-8. The former had formed obvious rosette structures characteristic of early neural differentiation by Day 16, whereas the latter more nearly resembled pluripotent stem cells (<Figure 2b>). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the addition of dual SMAD inhibitors led to the induction of the early human neural progenitor marker PAX6 (<Zhang et al., 2010>) in about 75% of cells after 16 days. By contrast, in the presence of ID-8, there was a dose dependent reduction in PAX 6 induction to around 5% of control levels at 5 μM (<Figure 2c>). We studied the time dependency of the ID-8 effect, to determine whether the compound was required during neural induction or later, after transfer to neural progenitor media. ID-8 had to be present during the period of neural induction and neural progenitor formation to achieve full inhibition of PAX6 expression (<Figure 2d>); it had no effect if added after the neural induction period. The decrease in PAX6 expression caused by ID-8 was accompanied by a decrease in NESTIN staining and an increase in POU5F1 staining in treated colonies (<Figure 2e>). We also evaluated the expression of stem cell surface markers in cultures subjected to neural induction alone or in the presence of ID-8. We have previously shown that flow cytometry using the cell surface markers GCTM-2 and CD9 can identify a continuum of pluripotent stem cell states within the population (<Hough et al., 2014>). Induction with dual SMAD inhibition alone resulted in a rapid depletion of the entire pluripotent stem cell population (<Figure 2f>). The addition of ID-8 had an unusual effect. As in control cells, dual SMAD inhibition resulted in loss of stem cell marker expression across much of the population, but the fraction expressing the highest level of stem cell markers persisted (<Figure 2f>). The proportion of cells remaining in this fraction relative to the rest of the population was markedly increased (140 fold) when ID-8 was present during dual SMAD inhibition. We then examined the effect of a series of known inhibitors of DYRK1A (<Figure 3a>) for effects in the PAX6 induction assay. In the same experiments, we also tested a known inhibitor of GSK3ß, to determine if ID-8 activity against this kinase (noted above) could account for its effects on neural induction. CHIR99021, a highly specific GSK3ß inhibitor, is used in some protocols for maintenance of hESC and therefore might be expected to mimic the inhibition of differentiation observed with ID-8 if the latter were acting through the GSK3B pathway. Of the compounds tested, only harmine and CHIR99021 produced statistically significant inhibition of neural induction in the dose tested (<Figure 3b>). Although some of these previously studied compounds are equipotent inhibitors of DYRK1A compared to ID-8, it is notable that ID-8 and harmine show relative selectivity for DYRK1A and B over DYRK2 and DYRK4 (<Supplementary file 3>). rhetorical Figure 3.

Only compounds 28, 30 and 45 displayed activity at 0.5 μM in this assay (<Figure 3c>). Thus, activity in this assay was quite sensitive to any alteration of the parent compound structure. As observed with ID-8, treatment of cells with compound 28 during dual SMAD inhibition resulted in colonies that contained few NESTIN positive cells and an increase in POU5F1 positive cells (<Figure 3d>). Considering the overall spectrum of kinase inhibition represented in the panel, the results argue that inhibition of DYRK1A accounts for compound activity in the assay. Compounds 34, 51 and 38 were inactive against DYRK1A and showed no activity in the differentiation assay. Compound 51 retained activity against PIM1 and PIM3, suggesting that off-target effects on these enzymes were unrelated to blockade of neural induction. Compound 28 showed much reduced activity against DYRK1B and GSK3B, and no activity against CLK1, but it was still active in the assay. Compound 30 likewise showed negligible activity against CLK1 and much reduced activity against GSK3A. Compounds 48 and 49, inactive in the neural induction assay, were active against CLK4 and PIM1 and PIM2.Although CHIR99021 treatment did reduce the extent of PAX-6 induction by dual SMAD inhibition, unlike ID-8 CHIR99021 co-administration did not result in retention of a pluripotent phenotype. Following neural induction, colonies formed in the presence of CHIR contained fewer POU5F1 positive cells compared to colonies induced in the presence of ID-8 or compound 28 (<Figure 3d>). These results were corroborated by studies of stem cell surface maker expression (<Figure 3e>). Expression of the cell surface antigens identified by antibodies GCTM-2 and TG30 (anti-CD9) was abolished by dual SMAD inhibition. Cells subjected to dual SMAD inhibition in the presence of ID-8 or compound 28 retained stem cell surface markers, but cells treated with CHIR99021 did not. These findings suggest that CHIR99021 was acting in a manner different to ID-8 to block neural induction, most probably through activation of the Wnt signaling pathway to induce alternate neural states (more caudal multipotent progenitors or neural crest) in conjunction with inhibition of stem cell renewal by SMAD2/3 inhibition, as shown previously by several groups (<Chambers et al., 2016>; <Denham et al., 2012>; <Denham et al., 2015>; <Menendez et al., 2011>). Off-target effects of ID-8 on DYRK1B, DYRK2, GSK3B, PIM1 or PIM3 or CLK1 or CLK4 might account for the inhibition of induction of neural differentiation by this compound. GSK3A, DYRK3, DYRK4, or LRRK2 are not expressed in hESC (www.stemformatics.org). The relationships between activity in kinase assays and activity of our panel of compounds in the neural induction bioassay described above would argue against a role for GSK3B, CLK1, CLK4, PIM1 or PIM3. To examine more directly the role of DYRK1A inhibition in the action of ID-8 on neural differentiation, we used a different model, namely a paradigm in which DYRK1A is specifically overexpressed in stem cells (<Figure 4a>). We used RNA guided gene activation mediated by the CRISPR system to switch on DYRK1A during induction of neural specification. gRNAs were designed to deliver a dCas9-VP64 activator construct to the DYRK1A regulatory region to enhance DYRK1A expression during induction of neural differentiation (<Figure 4a>). In this system, activation of DYRK1A (<Figure 4b>) during neural induction led to an increase in PAX6 expression that was offset by ID-8 or the other three inhibitors (compounds 28, 30 and 45, <Figure 4c>) active in the dual SMAD PAX6 induction assay described above.

WA09 hESC line was transduced with three separate doxycycline inducible DYRK1A shRNA constructs. Two out of three clones displayed strong knockdown of DYRK1A in the presence of doxycycline (<Figure 4d>). During neural specification, these two clones showed doxycycline inducible suppression of PAX6 expression (<Figure 4e>). Thus, DYRK1A knockdown phenocopies the effects of the inhibitors on PAX6 expression. We then confirmed the effects of inducible shRNA knockdown of DYRK1A in two more pluripotent stem cell lines, GENEA022 (the hESC line used in the DYRK1A activation study above) and C11(an hiPSC cell line). First we demonstrated that our active small molecule DYRK1A inhibitors could block the induction of PAX6 transcripts during neural induction by dual SMAD inhibition in WA09, GENEA022 and C11 cell lines (<Figure 4—figure supplement 1A>). Then we showed that shRNA knockdown of DYRK1A could phenocopy the effects of the inhibitors in GENEA022 and C11 cells (<Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C>). Immunoblotting of detergent extracts of WA09 cells treated with scrambled control shRNA or DYRK1A shRNA in the presence of doxycycline confirmed significant reduction of DYRK1A protein levels by two of the constructs (<Figure 4—figure supplement 1D>). Eleven X-ray crystal structures are available for DYRK1A in complex with a range of ligands (<Figure 5—figure supplement 1>). In order to rationalize the structure-activity relationships of the ID-8 analogues, we sought to understand how these compounds bind to DYRK1A by molecular modelling. Seven reported structures deposited in the protein databank were superimposed using Maestro and the ligand binding sites were closely examined (<Figure 5a>). In the majority of cases the amino group of K188 and the amide nitrogen atom of L241 were involved in hydrogen bonding to the ligands. In these crystal structures containing diverse ligands, the ligands bind to both of these amino acids through polar interactions with either nitrogen or oxygen atoms.

The average distance between both interacting atoms on the ligands was 8.3 ± 0.2 Å.Using the crystal structure complexed with LDN-211898 (PDB code 5AIK) a set of docking experiments using ID-8 and compound 45 were undertaken. ID-8 docked in three alternative modes, one of which was very similar to the bound states of other DYRK1 ligands, as illustrated by overlay with the experimentally-determined LDN-211898 bound into 5AIK (<Figure 5b>). In this pose, the plane of the indole ring of ID-8 coincides with the aromatic sections of LDN-211898. ID-8 docks such that there is a hydrogen bond from the 6-hydroxyl to the amide group of L241, which is achieved from a slightly different direction to LDN-211898 by binding deeper into the active site, while the para-methoxy group of ID-8 is bound to E203 (adjacent to the amino group of K188). The distance between the two interacting atoms of ID-8 is 8.22 Å, similar to that of other DYRK1A inhibitors. Similarly, the amino group of K188 hydrogen bonds to the para-hydroxyl group of ID-8 by placing this hydroxyl group deep into the binding site. Compound 45 was able to dock into the binding site of 5AIK (<Figure 5c>) forming hydrogen bonds between the 6-hydroxyl and the amide nitrogen of L241 (2.97 Å) as well as the backbone carbonyl group of E239 (3.09 Å). The nitro group formed an interaction with the primary amino group of K188 (3.02 Å). The distance between the two interacting oxygen atoms of compound 45 is 7.78 Å. While compound 45 did not dock in the same mode as ID-8 it is easily be envisaged that this mode of binding is possible, as this compound possesses the same key polar interaction oxygens present in ID-8. A confounding factor encountered in docking both ID-8 and 45 is that the nitro group is more polar than the other two hydrogen bonding groups, and the docking algorithm is biased towards placing this group within the site to achieve polar interactions. Here we present evidence that the indole compound ID-8 and a series of related molecules act to inhibit the neural specification of hESC through inhibition of DYRK1A. Our biochemical studies revealed that ID-8 is a relatively specific inhibitor of DYRK1A, and that the activity of a series of related compounds on neural specification most closely correlated to their ability to inhibit this enzyme."
PMC5656431_6,"Further, in pluripotent stem cells specifically engineered to overexpress DYRK1A, neural specification induced by dual SMAD inhibition is enhanced, and this effect is offset by addition of ID-8 or other DYRK1A inhibitors  Finally, DYRK1A knockdown phenocopied the effect of the inhibitors on PAX6 expression during neural specification.Our docking analysis provides a set of possible binding modes for ID-8 and compound 45, which allow a rationalization of the potency of ID-8 analogues (Table 2) as inhibitors of DYRK1A. For example, the lack of inhibition for compounds 38 and 51 likely arise from the absence of a hydroxyl group at position 6 which therefore cannot interact with L241. Substitution at this position with a methyl group in compound 28 led to a small reduction in potency, while larger acetyl or benzyl in compounds 29, 30 and 34 led to a marked reduction in potency. Compounds 48 and 49, bearing methoxy groups oriented ortho or meta, respectively, cannot make ideal interactions with E203. Studies in man have implicated missense mutations affecting residues around the proposed binding site of ID-8 and compound 45 in the microcephaly syndrome associated with DYRK1A deficiency (<Ji et al., 2015>).hPSC provide powerful models for understanding early human development. The biological actions of the DYRK1A inhibitors described here provide new insight into the effect of the absence of this kinase on neural development in the embryo. In human or mouse, hemizygous loss of DYRK1A leads to microcephaly, a severe disorder of brain development. Some of the phenotypes of Dyrk1a knockout mouse, and haploinsufficient humans (<Bronicki et al., 2015>; <Courcet et al., 2012>; <Fotaki et al., 2002>; <Ji et al., 2015>; <Møller et al., 2008>), could be explained by an action at a very early stage of lineage specification in the embryo. Our previous work showed that ID-8 treatment of hESC blocked the ability of WNT3A to induce expression of mesoderm or endoderm genes (<Hasegawa et al., 2012>). This study reveals that DYRK1A inhibition specifically interferes with the early specification of hESC to neural fates. Together, these findings suggest that DYRK1A loss might exert a profound effect on endowment of the three germ layer lineages in homozygous or heterozygous null embryos. Dyrk1a homozygous null mice die at E10.5, with growth delay in multiple organ systems, including heart, brain, liver and branchial arches. Humans heterozygous for loss or mutation of DYRK1A display severe microcephaly, but also commonly show developmental delay and intrauterine growth retardation. It is possible that failure to allocate sufficient numbers of pluripotent progenitors into the three germ layer lineages could result in generalised developmental deficiencies and delay, along with severe central nervous defects. The neural specification assay here is suitable for rapid screening of the effects of DYRK1A inhibition on neural development in human cells, and could aid in development of novel inhibitors, as could the CRISPR mediated DYRK1A induction assay, which mimics the gene dosage effect of DYRK1A overexpression in Down syndrome. Indeed, the results of this assay suggest that DYRK1A inhibitors could be used to ameliorate neural phenotypes in Down syndrome, though clearly the dose of the agents would need to be controlled rather precisely to avoid excessive reduction in enzyme activity.Our observations are in contrast to previously reported actions of DYRK1A inhibition in mouse embryonic stem cells, where treatment with epigallocatechin-gallate caused reduced expression of pluripotency genes and enhanced expression of mesodermal and endodermal lineage specific genes (<Canzonetta et al., 2008>). However, epigallocatechin-gallate is a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor that lacks specificity for DYRK1A, and its effects on mouse ES cells could be attributable to interference with other pathways, or to species differences in stem cell regulation.The actions of DYRK1A inhibitors on human pluripotent stem cells provide important insight into the role of this kinase in stem cell regulation. ID-8 treatment did not affect expression of stem cell markers in cultures maintained under conditions that support self-renewal. Neither did the compound affect proliferation of stem cells maintained under these conditions. We showed previously that ID-8 could promote colony formation of hESC, but this effect was modest, except in combination with WNT3A. The strongest effect of treatment of hESC with ID-8 observed in our previous work was the inhibition of induced differentiation. In cells treated with WNT3A (<Hasegawa et al., 2012>), WNT3A induction of mesodermal and endodermal genes was strikingly attenuated by ID-8. Here we showed that the powerful neural induction using dual SMAD inhibition could be offset by treatment of stem cells with ID-8.Careful inspection of flow cytometry profiles after ID-8 treatment revealed that the response of the cell population to DYRK1A inhibition was not homogenous. In fact, a large proportion of cells treated with dual SMAD inhibition with or without ID-8 lost stem cell surface markers. However, in ID-8 treated cultures, the cellular subset bearing the highest levels of stem cell markers appeared to remain intact, and indeed was proportionally expanded 140 fold in differentiating cultures relative to other subpopulations under the condition of DYRK1A inhibition. We have previously shown that this cellular subset represents the self-renewing component of hESC cultures, and that it has molecular properties distinct to the bulk of the stem cell population (<Hough et al., 2014>). Recently we have observed that this subpopulation of hESC has an unusual cell cycle, with a short or non-existent G1 phase compared to the remainder of the population (unpublished). It is known that hPSC become competent to respond to differentiation signals in G1 phase of the cycle (<Boward et al., 2016>). Our results suggest that DYRK1A inhibition by ID-8 prevents the self-renewing subpopulation from acquiring competence to respond to induction of differentiation, rendering it refractory to strong extrinsic inductive signals. Thus, transition to a differentiation permissive state may require activation of DYRK1A, an effect that may be actuated through the lengthening of G1 in the self-renewing population. Inhibition of DYRK1A could prevent the lengthening of the G1 phase and thereby block progression of the self-renewing hESC subpopulation towards neural specification. Further study of DYRK1A will provide additional insight into its role in early development, and the mechanism whereby its activity modulates the competence of hESC to respond to inducers of lineage specification. LDN193189 (Stemgent, Lexington, MA, #130-096-226), SB431542 (Stemgent, #130-097-448), CHIR99021 (Stemgent, #130-095-555) and harmine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, #SMB00461) were purchased from commercial suppliers. All other inhibitors were synthesised as described in the Supplemental Methods. All compounds were solid powders, stable at room temperature. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO to achieve desired stock concentrations, and were aliquoted for long-term storage at −20 or −80°C. Stock concentrations were diluted further in DMSO, to desired concentration for adding to cell culture, such that DMSO concentration in cell culture media did not exceed 0.15%. Kinase inhibition assays were performed by Reaction Biology (www.reactionbiology.com). Each kinase was produced as a recombinant protein and used a matched peptide substrate. The reaction buffer was 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.02% Brij35, 0.02 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM DTT, 1% DMSO. Radioassays were performed using 10 μM ATP and 10 μCi/μl [γ-33P]ATP. Enzyme concentrations were 0.2–50 nM, and peptide substrate concentration was 20 μM. Reactions were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature, then spotted onto P81 ion exchange paper, and product detected by radiometry."
PMC5656431_7,"For initial screening, candidate inhibitors were included at 10 μM, and activity was calculated as percentage inhibition relative to the control with no inhibitor  For determination of IC50 values, inhibitors were included into kinase reactions at 10 concentrations with 3-fold serial dilutions starting at 30 μM. WA09 and HES3 (PAX6mCherry)cell lines were maintained by and provided by the Stem Cell Core Facility of Stem Cells Australia. The knock-in reporter HES3 (PAX6mCherry) cells were developed as described (below). hESC lines WA09 (obtained from WiCell (WA09 MEF platform), GENEA022 (provided by Genea Biocells), and hiPSC line C11 (<Briggs et al., 2013>) were maintained at the University of Queensland laboratories on fibroblast feeder cell support in medium supplemented with Knockout Serum Replacer and FGF-2 (Invitrogen/Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), with daily media changes. For propagation in defined media, WA9 cells were adapted from culture on mouse embryo fibroblasts (mechanically dissociated organ cultures) at passage 74 or 87, and maintained thereafter on hES-qualified Matrigel in mTesR1 (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) medium using dispase to disaggregate the cells. HES3(PAX6mCherry) were cultured on hES-qualified Matrigel in mTesR1 medium. Medium was changed daily, and cells were passaged with dispase. Cell line identity was confirmed by STR profiling. DNA fragments representing the 5’ and 3’ homology arms were derived from bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BAC) RP11-26B16 and RP11-307I15 (Roswell Park Cancer Institute), which included sequences spanning the PAX6 stop codon. The PAX6 targeting vector was assembled using a combination of recombineering and standard cloning procedures. Sequences representing the 3.6 Kb 5’ homology arm were amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned into a vector containing a PGKNeo selection cassette and sequences corresponding to the 7.8 Kb 3’ homology arm, the latter having been previously introduced into this plasmid using recombineering. This vector was then linearised at an Mlu1 site at the junction of the 5’ homology arm and the PGKNeo selection cassette, enabling the sequential introduction of a T2A sequence that replaced the PAX6 stop codon and, an mCherry-IRES-puromycin cassette. Prior to electroporation, the final plasmid was digested with Pac1 and AsiS1 to release the targeting vector as depicted in <Figure 2—figure supplement 2a>. The HES3 cell line (<Richards et al., 2002>) was electroporated with the PAX6 targeting vector using standard conditions (<Costa et al., 2007>). Single G418 resistant colonies were screened for correct integration of the targeting vector using PCR primers that corresponded to sequences within the PGKneo cassette and genomic sequences 3’ of the 3’ end of the 3’ PAX6 homology arm: neo4 (cgatgcctgcttgccgaatatcatg) & 39783R (gccgattcctgagcctttcatacc). Two positive clones identified in this initial screen were then validated by repeating the PCR analysis performed in the original screen and by performing a second PCR analysis that confirmed correct recombination of the vector at the 5’ end. This second PCR, which utilised the primer pairs cherryrev2 (ccatgttatcctcctcgcccttgc) and 27749F (gctaacctgtcccacctgatttcc), generated the predicted product of 8.6 Kb. The result of this confirmatory PCR analysis is shown in <Figure 2—figure supplement 2b>. These positive clones were expanded and subsequently transfected with a cre recombinase expression vector as described previously (<Davis et al., 2008>), resulting in excision of the PGKNeo cassette. Successful removal of this cassette was confirmed using PCR analysis. Subclones of each primary clone were then submitted for karyotype analysis, performed by the Cytogenetics Department at Southern Cross Pathology, Monash Medical Centre. A single subclone, PAX6 # 85.2 with a normal female karyotype was then chosen for further analysis. The neural induction assay involved the directed differentiation of hESC to neural progenitor cells, and is based on the dual-SMAD inhibition methods by <Chambers et al. (2009)>. HES3(PAX6mCherry) or WA09 cells in mTeSR1 were passaged using 1 mg/ml dispase onto Matrigel coated 3 cm dishes and cultured in mTesR1. The cells were grown to minimum 30% confluency prior to supplementation with 5 µM SB431542 and 100 nM LDN193189, in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors diluted in DMSO, or DMSO vehicle only for the controls, with a total DMSO concentration of 0.15% in each dish. Media was changed every 2 days, with continual inhibitor supplementation. At day 7, the cells were transferred into Neurobasal media (Invitrogen/Thermofisher) with FGF2 and EGF, continuing kinase inhibitor supplementation, without LDN/SB inhibitors. At day 9, cells were mechanically lifted/scraped from the bottom of the dish, dissociated to clumps by pipetting, and passaged onto fresh Matrigel coated 3 cm dishes in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 5 μM Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, achieving approximately 30% confluency immediately following passage. At day 11, Rho kinase inhibitor was withdrawn, and cells were maintained in Neurobasal media with continual supplementation of DYRK inhibitors with media changes every 2 days, until the cells were fixed for immunofluorescence or harvested for flow cytometry. For statistical analysis, P values were calculated using a paired two-tailed Student’s t-test with correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure with a false discovery rate of 0.075. All experiments were repeated 2–3 times with three technical replicates in each data point. Flow cytometry measurement of the expression of the pluripotent stem cell surface markers GCTM2 and CD9, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for POU5F1 and nestin on paraformaldehyde fixed adherent cell cultures, were performed as previously described (<Hough et al., 2014>). The cell cycle distribution of control and ID-8 treated pluripotent WA09 cells was analysed using the Click-IT EdU Flow Cytometry Kit AF488 (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, #C-10425). Apoptosis of control and ID-8 treated pluripotent WA09 cells was analysed using the Abcam In situ BrdU-Red DNA Fragmentation (TUNEL) Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Both kits were used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. All experiments were repeated two to three times. To identify gRNAs capable of driving CRISPRa activation of the DYRK1A gene, a number of unique 20mers in region between −250 to −50 bps relative to the main transcription start site were cloned in the pX462 gRNA and dCas9-VP64-expression vector and tested by transfection into the 293FT human cells, with subsequent qPCR analysis of DYRK1A expression. Generation of stable cell lines was achieved by transduction of the 2 selected best-performing gRNA (gRNA #1 CCGGCAAATACCGCAGTCCC; gRNA#2, CGCTGGAACCGCGAGCCGAG)-expressing lentiviruses (pLKO.1-sgRNA-Neo) into the recipient pre-validated hESC Genea022 line expressing HA-dCas9-VP64 in a doxycycline-inducible fashion. Neural differentiation, used as a backdrop for the inhibitor assay, was performed for 6 days in KSR medium supplemented with 10 µM SB431542 and 0.5 µM LDN193189 and devoid of pluripotency-maintenance growth factors. Control cultures grown ±doxycyline, and cultures treated with inhibitor compounds, contained 0.1% DMSO for the duration of the assay. For statistical analysis, P values were calculated using a paired two-tailed Student’s t-test with correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure with a false discovery rate of 0.075. All experiments were repeated 2–3 times with three technical replicates per data point. For an inducible knockdown of the DYRK1A expression, we transduced human pluripotent stem cell cultures (WA09, GENEA022, and C11) with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral particles: one control (non-targeting) and three DYRK1A ORF-targeting shRNAs in doxycycline-inducible SMARTvectors (GE Healthcare/Dharmacon, product # DHA-VSC11653 and V3SH11255)."
PMC5656431_8,"The virus was packaged using the 293FT cell line (LifeTechnologies/Invitrogen) transfected with a second-generation lentiviral packaging plasmid psPAX2, a gift from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12260)  Selection for cells harboring expressable proviral integrants was started 5 days after transduction with puromycin at 2 μg/mL. DYRK1A knockdown was induced by treatment with doxycycline at 0.5 μg/mL for 3 days prior to, and during the 6 days of, the dual SMAD inhibition-driven neural differentiation. Effects of small molecule DYRK1A inhibitors and shRNA on DYRK1A and PAX6 transcript induction during neural specification were assessed in the cell lines used for knockdown studies at Day 16 in the protocol described above. PAX6 transcript levels were measured by qPCR on total RNA (0.5 µg)-derived cDNA (using iScript polyA and random-priming cDNA synthesis system, Bio-Rad) extracted from pluripotent cells subjected to a standard (dual SMAD inhibition) neuroepithelial differentiation in presence of the indicated compounds for 16 days. Detergent extracts of shRNA treated cells were separated on denaturing and reducing 12% tris-glycine-sodium dodecyl sulphate acrylamide gels. The samples were prepared using a protease and phosphatase-supplemented mix of RIPA and 2x Laemmli buffers (Sigma-Aldrich). Following gel transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the blots were probed using primary antibodies against DYRK1A (D30C10 Rabbit mAb #8765, Cell Signalling Technologies,U.S.A.) and GAPDH (14C10 Rabbit mAb #2118, CST), and a secondary anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked Antibody (#7074, CST). Visualisation was performed using Clarity ECL substrate, and densitometric quantification performed using ImageLab4.1 software (Bio-Rad, U.S.A.). Eleven crystal structures are available of DYRK1A with bound ligands. These were superimposed using Maestro and an analysis of the binding sites was carried out. Maestro (version 2015–3) was used to dock ligands into 5AIK using the XP algorithm and the default settings were applied. The protein was prepared using the protein preparation wizard. Genetic analysis has revealed that the dual specificity protein kinase DYRK1A has multiple roles in the development of the central nervous system. Increased DYRK1A gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, is known to affect neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of DYRK1A, we show here that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of DYRK1A interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. Specifically, DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of the absence or haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A on early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for DYRK1A in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells. ."
PMC4891281_0,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that develops after repetitive head injury. Several lines of evidence in other tauopathies suggest that tau oligomer formation induces neurotoxicity and that tau oligomer-mediated neurotoxicity involves induction of axonal dysfunction through exposure of an N-terminal motif in tau, the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). Additionally, phosphorylation at serine 422 in tau occurs early and correlates with cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We performed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on fixed brain sections and biochemical analysis of fresh brain extracts to characterize the presence of PAD-exposed tau (TNT1 antibody), tau oligomers (TOC1 antibody), tau phosphorylated at S422 (pS422 antibody), and tau truncated at D421 (TauC3 antibody) in the brains of 9-11 cases with CTE and cases of nondemented aged controls and AD (Braak VI) (n = 6, each). All 3 early tau markers (ie, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422) were present in CTE and displayed extensive colocalization in perivascular tau lesions that are considered diagnostic for CTE. Notably, the TauC3 epitope, which is abundant in AD, was relatively sparse in CTE. Together, these results provide the first description of PAD exposure, TOC1 reactive oligomers, phosphorylation of S422, and TauC3 truncation in the tau pathology of CTE. We would like to dedicate this work to the late Lester “Skip” Binder.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is found in individuals with a history of repetitive mild brain trauma (eg, athletes and military personnel) (<1>–<3>). Although recognition of the clinical symptoms of CTE was first reported by Martland in 1928 (<4>), the first large clinicopathological series of CTE was published in 1973 by Corsellis and colleagues, who described neurofibrillary degeneration of the substantia nigra and cerebral cortex using Von Braunmühl silver stain (<5>). The distinctive perivascular pattern of abnormally phosphorylated tau pathology in CTE was first observed by Geddes et al in 1999, who also noted the preferential distribution at the depths of the cerebral sulci (<6>). In 2013, McKee and coworkers reported the clinical and immunohistochemical characteristics of 68 subjects with CTE and introduced pathological criteria for the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE (<7>).The current criteria for the pathological diagnosis of CTE are based on hallmark features that include perivascular accumulation of phosphorylated tau in a strikingly irregular pattern concentrated at the depths of cerebral sulci (<7>); [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/research/tbi/ReportFirstNIHConsensusConference.htm]. Pathological tau inclusions in CTE are found in neurons as pretangles and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), in astrocytes as thorn-shaped astrocytes, and in dot-like and thread-like cellular processes around small blood vessels, and in the neuropil (<3>). Other pathological features of CTE include axonal loss, neuroinflammation, accumulation of phosphorylated deposits of TDP-43, and substantial brain atrophy. A four-stage staging system was recently described to identify the severity of pathological tau deposition in CTE (<7>). In stage I of CTE, isolated focal perivascular tau lesions are found at sulcal depths of the cortex. In stage II, perivascular tau lesions are found in multiple sites in multiple cortical regions, and there is mild involvement of subcortical regions (eg, locus coeruleus and substantia nigra). Progression into stage III CTE is characterized by more widespread cortical pathology and involvement of medial temporal lobe structures (ie, hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex) and additional subcortical regions. Finally, in stage IV CTE, there is cerebral atrophy and neuronal loss that is accompanied by widely distributed tau pathology throughout the cortex, medial temporal lobe, diencephalon, and brainstem.Previous studies used traditional markers of disease-related tau phosphoepitopes such as PHF1, CP13, and AT8 antibodies to label the tau inclusions (<6>–<10>), and there are reports of biochemical analyses of tau isolated from CTE brains (<11>, <12>). Together, these existing studies have not investigated the progressive evolution of pathological changes in tau protein that are associated with CTE. By contrast, in Alzheimer disease (AD), we know that tau pathology undergoes a stereotypical sequence of changes (eg, phosphorylation, conformational shifts, and truncation) that are identified using various tau antibodies as the pathology progresses (<13>, <14>). For example, phosphorylation of serine 422 (identified using the pS422 antibody) occurs in early, pretangle neurons, and progressive accumulation of pS422 tau pathology in the cholinergic basal forebrain correlates well with cognitive decline across nondemented aged control (ND), mild cognitively impaired (MCI), and AD cases (<15>–<17>). Following some conformational and phosphorylation changes (eg, the Alz50 conformation, pS422, AT8, and pT231) and as the pathological inclusions mature from the early stages through the later stages, the C-terminus is cleaved at aspartic acid 421, giving rise to the neoepitope of the TauC3 antibody in AD (<13>–<22>). In addition, 2 recently identified pretangle stage changes in tau appear to confer toxicity to the tau protein (<23>–<26>)."
PMC4891281_1,"Tau contains a biologically active motif in the amino terminus of tau, called the phosphatase-activating domain ([PAD], amino acids 2–18), and aberrant exposure of PAD triggers a signaling cascade that impairs fast anterograde axonal transport (<24>, <27>)  The TNT1 antibody is a marker that indicates whether PAD is exposed in tau, and the pattern of TNT1 staining in neurons suggests PAD exposure is a very early pretangle pathological change in tau in AD (<23>, <24>). Second, a recently characterized antibody called tau-oligomer complex 1 (TOC1) selectively labels tau oligomers over monomeric or filamentous tau (<25>, <26>, <28>–<30>). A number of disease-relevant modifications of tau, including oligomer formation, appear to alter tau conformation in ways that aberrantly expose PAD (<29>, <31>). Thus, both TNT1 and TOC1 are pretangle pathological tau changes in AD that may indicate potential toxic mechanisms of tau pathologies, and pS422 is an early change that is well correlated with cognitive decline. The hypothesis that the earliest modifications in tau drive its toxicity is consistent with accumulating evidence that the classical inclusions (such as NFTs) are not the toxic form of tau (<32>, <33>), but rather it is the small, misfolded oligomeric species (<29>, <34>–<37>).In the current work, we sought to identify whether pathological changes in tau, such as PAD exposure, oligomer formation, phosphorylation at S422, and C-terminal truncation are also characteristic of CTE pathology. These 4 markers are particularly useful in understanding potential posttraumatic events in CTE because PAD exposure impairs axonal transport (<24>), oligomers confer toxicity (<28>, <38>–<40>), pS422 correlates with cognitive decline (<15>), and D421 truncated tau may be related to cell toxicity (<41>, <42>). Using a combination of immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses, we provide the first description of PAD exposure, tau oligomers, S422 phosphorylation, and C-terminal cleaved tau in CTE and characterize the types of pathological lesions composed of these abnormal tau forms. In CTE, neuronal and glial tau pathologies contained PAD-exposed tau (TNT1-reactive), tau oligomers (TOC1-reactive), and phosphorylated S422 tau (ps422-reactive), and all 3 forms of pathology were highly colocalized. While the types of neuronal and glial pathologies in CTE share some features with AD, other tauopathies, and normal aging, there are several important distinctions (<2>, <43>). For example, the TauC3 epitope that is abundant in AD was very infrequent in CTE, and dot-like neurites, a common feature in CTE, are infrequent in AD. Furthermore, biochemical and immunohistological analyses of TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 tau all showed high levels in CTE brain samples, in contrast to the very low levels in ND. Collectively, these data suggest some of the early phosphoepitopes and conformational tau changes that are linked to potential mechanisms of toxicity in AD also occur in CTE, although with some notable distinctions. For the immunohistochemical analyses, 9 cases of CTE without comorbid pathology including the absence of b-amyloid plaques (CTE stage II, n = 2; CTE stage III, n = 5; and CTE stage IV, n = 2) were obtained from the Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Center (BU ADC) CTE Program and VA Boston (Boston, MA). Fixed tissue sections from temporal cortex of 6 ND and 6 severe AD cases (Braak VI) were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Banner Sun Health Research Institute (Sun City, AZ) (<44>). Fresh frozen brain tissue samples from 23 cases were used for the biochemical analyses consisting of 11 cases of CTE (CTE stage II/III, n = 5; CTE stage IV, n = 6), obtained from the BU ADC CTE Program, as well as 6 ND (Braak II) and 6 cases of AD (Braak VI) obtained from the Brain Bank of the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). All CTE cases met pathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE (<3>) and were staged according to severity and distribution of tau pathology using an antibody to phosphorylated PHF-tau (AT8; Pierce Endogen, Rockford IL; 1:2,000), as described (<43>). All cases of CTE were free of comorbid neurodegenerative disease or other neuropathologies. Neuropathologists (ACM, TDS) performed the neuropathological evaluation blinded to all patient medical history, clinical symptoms, and APOE genotype. For detailed human subject information, see <Supplementary Data 1> (a table containing data on the cases used in this study). Soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions were prepared from flash frozen frontal cortex tissue of ND, CTE, and AD cases. Each extraction was prepared by homogenizing 0.5 to 1 gram of frontal cortex on ice in 10 volumes (1 g = 10 mL) of brain homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 274 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 lg/mL each of pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin). The soluble tau fraction was collected in the supernatant following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The remaining pellet was homogenized further in brain pellet homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 800 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged as above. The supernatants were collected, sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 1%, incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 hour at 4°C. Lastly, the final pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of brain pellet homogenization buffer representing the sarkosyl insoluble tau fraction. Both the soluble tau and sarkosyl insoluble tau fractions were assayed for total protein concentration using the Lowry protein assay and stored at −80°C until used in sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A number of tau antibodies were used that are characterized in AD but not in CTE (<Table 1>). The TNT1 antibody (mouse IgG1, Binder/Kanaan Lab, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI) was made against PAD (ie, amino acids 2–18), and TNT1 is a marker of pathological conformations in which PAD is exposed in tissue sections and nondenaturing assays (<23>, <24>). The TOC1 antibody (mouse IgM, Binder/Kanaan Lab) has an epitope between 209–224 (numbering based on full-length tau containing 441 amino acids) and selectively recognizes oligomeric tau aggregate conformations, compared to monomeric tau or filamentous aggregate conformations (<25>, <26>). The pS422 antibody is a monoclonal rabbit antibody (79415, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) that recognizes tau when serine 422 is phosphorylated. In the cholinergic basal forebrain, the accumulation of pS422 tau pathology is well correlated with cognitive decline during the progression of AD (<15>). All 3 antibodies used here (ie, pS422, TNT1, and TOC1) are markers of early, pretangle tau pathology in AD and other tauopathies (<15>–<17>, <23>–<26>). TauC3 is an antibody (mouse IgG1, Binder/Kanaan Lab) that recognizes tau truncated at D421 (<22>), a modification that appears later in the early phases of NFT development and increases with progression in AD (<13>–<16>, <18>–<21>). Astrocytes were identified using a glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody ([GFAP], mouse IgG1, G3893, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and microglia were identified using a human leukocyte antigen–DR antibody ([HLA-DR], clone LN3, mouse IgG2b, 8693031, MP Biomed, Santa Ana, CA). The R1 antibody (Binder Lab), a rabbit polyclonal pantau antibody with numerous epitopes throughout the tau protein (<45>), was used in the sandwich ELISAs. The Tau5 antibody (mouse IgG1, Binder/Kanaan Lab) is a mouse monoclonal antibody with an epitope between 210–230 (<46>), which is unaffected by phosphorylation or conformation; this antibody was used in the sandwich ELISAs (<Table 1>). Novel sandwich ELISAs were developed to measure the relative quantities of each form of tau present in the soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions in the frontal cortex from ND, CTE, and AD brains."
PMC4891281_2,"The levels of total tau, PAD-exposed tau, oligomeric tau, or C-terminal truncated tau were measured using the mouse monoclonal Tau5, TNT1, TOC1, or TauC3 antibody as the capture antibody, respectively  The R1 tau antibody (a polyclonal rabbit pan-tau antibody unaffected by phosphorylation) was used for detection of bound tau. The levels of tau phosphorylated at S422 were measured using the rabbit pS422 antibody as the capture antibody and the mouse monoclonal Tau5 antibody (a pan-tau antibody unaffected by phosphorylation) for the detection of bound tau. All steps were performed at room temperature; 200 μL/well were used for the rinsing and blocking steps; and 50 μL/well were used for all other steps. Capture antibodies were diluted (Tau5 at 1 μg/mL; TNT1, TOC1 pS422, or TauC3 at 2 μg/mL) in borate saline (100 mM boric acid, 25 mM sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 75 mM NaCl, 250 μM thimerosal) and incubated in high binding ELISA microplates (Corning, #3590, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1 hour. Plates were rinsed twice with ELISA wash buffer (100 mM boric acid, 25 mM sodium tetraborate decahydrate, 75 mM NaCl, 250 μM thimerosal, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% tween-20) and blocked with ELISA wash containing 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 hour. Each well was rinsed 2 times, and then the samples were added to the well for 1.5 hours. Human brain extracts were diluted to a final total protein concentration of 0.4 μg/mL (ie, 20 μg/well) for soluble tau fractions or 0.08 μg/mlL (ie, 4 μg/well) for insoluble tau fractions, and 50 μL/well was used in each ELISA. The optimal protein amounts for each fraction were determined in titering experiments to ensure the ELISAs were performed within the linear rage of reactivity. Wells were rinsed twice, and then R1 (0.1 μg/mL) or Tau5 (0.025 μg/mL) detection antibodies were diluted in blocking reagent, and added to each well for 1.5 hours. Wells were rinsed 3 times and incubated for 1.5 hours with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PI-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or horse anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PI-2000, Vector Laboratories) diluted (0.2 μg/mL) in blocking reagent. The wells were rinsed 3 times, signal was detected by developing with TMB (3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine, Sigma) for 12 minutes, and then the reaction was stopped using 3.5% sulfuric acid. Tau standard ELISAs were performed with the human sample sandwich ELISAs to estimate the amount of tau captured by Tau 5, TNT1, TOC1, pS422, or TauC3. For the tau standards, a serial dilution of recombinant full-length human tau protein (produced as described previously [<46>]) ranging from 200 to 0.2 ng was bound to the ELISA plate for 1 hour, then blocked as above; detection was performed using either R1 or Tau5 antibodies and HRP-secondary antibodies exactly as in the sandwich ELISAs. Each standard was run in duplicate and developed simultaneously with the sandwich ELISAs to ensure accurate interpolation of unknown tau amounts. The standard curve data were log10 transformed and best fit to a sigmoidal curve (r2 = 0.996 for both). This provided a standard curve of absorbance values that were derived from R1 or Tau5 reactivity with known amounts of tau protein. The quantity of tau (ng) in each human sample was interpolated from the tau standard curves and then converted to a concentration of ng/μL by dividing the interpolated quantity by the volume of the sample used (ie, 50 μL). <Supplementary Data 2> illustrates and provides an example of the tau standard and sandwich ELISAs used here. In all assays, wells with the samples omitted were used as blanks to obtain background levels that were subtracted from sample signals. Fixed tissue sections (cut at 50 μm) from the superior frontal gyrus (CTE) were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) using pS422, TNT1, TOC1, and TauC3 antibodies. Forty-μm-thick sections from the temporal lobe of ND and AD cases were included as references for the pathological tau lesions. For detailed information regarding the tissue fixation and processing protocols from each tissue resource see <Supplementary Data 3> (a description of the fixation and tissue processing procedures at BU and Banner Sun Health). The blocking, peroxidase quenching, avidin-biotin complex labeling, and all rinsing steps were performed as previously described (<47>). Primary antibodies (<Table 1>) were incubated with the tissue sections overnight at 4°C, followed by a 2-hour incubation in biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy plus light chains) secondary antibody (BA-9200, diluted 1:500) for TNT1 and TauC3, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (BA-2020, diluted 1:500) for TOC1, or biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (HþL) secondary antibody (BA-1000, diluted 1:500) for pS422 (all from Vector Laboratories). The labeling was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma, D5637), which produces a brown chromogen. Following IHC development, the sections were mounted and processed for Nissl counterstaining using the Cresyl violet protocol previously described (<48>). Control sections with the primary antibody omitted were performed to ensure the IHC signals were derived from tau antibody labeling and not due to nonspecific reactivity with the tissue (<Supplementary Data 4>, photomicrographs of primary delete control sections). Staining penetration through the entire z-axis of the tissue sections was confirmed by focusing through the sections at high magnification (ie, 60×/1.4 na). Image z-stacks (0.5-mm step size) were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope, a Nikon DS-Ri1 camera, and Nikon Elements AR software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY), and the images (displayed using the extended depth of focus function) were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Triple-label immunofluorescence (IF) was used to characterize the colocalization between either tau phosphorylated at S422, tau with PAD-exposed and tau oligomers, or between pS422 tau and glial cell markers. Tissue sections (same as above) from CTE and AD cases were processed for triple-label IF using the TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 antibodies. Glial cells were identified using anti-GFAP or anti-HLA-DR antibodies, and tau inclusions were labeled with pS422. All staining for IF was done according to published methods (<48>, <49>). For the colocalization of TNT1, TOC1, and pS422, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in a primary antibody solution containing each antibody followed by incubation in a secondary antibody solution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1-specific (A-21121), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgM-specific (A-21043), and Alexa Fluor 405 goat anti-rabbit specific (A-31556) antibodies (all from Invitrogen, Billerica, MA, diluted 1:500) for 2 hours. For the colocalization of pS422, GFAP, and HLA-DR, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in a primary antibody solution containing each antibody followed by incubation in a secondary antibody solution of Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit specific (A-21244), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG1-specific (A-21124), and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG2b-specific (A-21141), antibodies (diluted 1:500) for 2 hours. Following the staining procedure, sections were mounted on microscope slides; autofluorescence was blocked using Sudan black (BP109-10; Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described (<23>, <24>, <47>), and then coverslipped using Vectashield hardset mountant (H-1400; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Control sections where one of the primary antibodies was omitted confirmed that each secondary label was specific to the appropriate primary antibody because no staining was observed with the fluorophore for the omitted antibody (<Supplementary Data 5>, confocal photomicrographs of IF control sections). Image z-stacks (0.5 μm step size) were taken using a Nikon A1þ laser scanning confocal microscope system equipped with 488, 561, and 640 solid-state lasers, Nikon Elements AR software, and the images (maximum intensity projections) were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator."
PMC4891281_3,"Data from the ELISAs (ie, tau concentrations) were normalized to reduce skewness using logarithmic transformations and then used for statistical comparisons  Differences between ND, CTE stage II/III, CTE stage IV, and AD cases were determined using one-way analysis of variance tests with the Tukey post hoc analysis for all possible comparisons when overall significance was achieved. Correlations with age, disease stage, postmortem interval, and age at disease onset were performed for CTE cases using the Spearman rank correlation test. A Spearman correlation matrix was run between each tau marker in CTE cases. Significance was set at p < 0.05; all analyses were two-tailed. All statistical comparisons and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism v5.0f software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). The tau pathology labeled with TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 was irregular and focal in distribution, preferentially located around small blood vessels and very prominent at the depths of the sulci (<Fig. 1>; <Supplementary Data 6>). Immunoreactivity for PAD-exposed tau, oligomeric tau, and pS422 tau also was found in the somatodendritic compartment of many cortical neurons and neurites within the superficial cortical laminae (eg, layers II/III) (<Figs. 1>, <2>). Notably, a number of neurons contained TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 immunoreactivity in a diffuse granular pattern (<Fig. 3A, C, E>), confirming that in CTE these changes in tau occur in early, pretangle pathology (<50>–<52>). With increasing pathological maturity, there is a mix of the diffuse granular staining and smaller compact inclusions (<50>–<52>); these neurons were labeled with TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 (<Fig. 3B, D, F>). Immunoreactivity often extended long distances from the somata in neural processes that appeared connected to the neuron (<Fig. 3B, D, F>). As in AD, these markers continued to label more mature NFTs (ie, intracellular NFTs), but “ghost tangles” (extracellular NFTs) were not well labeled with these markers (<Fig. 2A–C>). The ND cases contained little reactivity for TNT1, TOC1, or pS422 in the temporal lobe gyri (<Fig. 2I–L>). Immunoreactivity for TauC3 was relatively sparse and sometimes nonexistent in CTE (<Figs. 1D>, H, <2D>). ND tissue was also very rarely labeled with the TauC3 antibody (<Fig. 2L>). In contrast, immunoreactivity for TauC3 in AD was abundant (<Fig. 2H> compared to 2D and 2L), as previously established (<13>, <14>, <16>, <22>). In addition to the tau pathology in the somatodendritic compartment, dystrophic axons in the white matter were labeled with TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 in CTE (<Fig. 4A–C>), which resembled those seen in AD with these markers (<Fig. 4D–F>). The colocalization between TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 was determined using triple label immunofluorescence staining. The vast majority of the pathology showed extensive colocalization for all 3 tau markers in CTE (<Fig. 5A–H>), but occasionally small portions of the pathology contained only single or double labeling (<Fig. 5>). These data indicate that PAD exposure, oligomer formation, and phosphorylation at S422 occur early and simultaneously in neurons in CTE. The glial tau pathologies in the superior frontal gyrus of CTE brains had the morphological characteristics of astrocytic tau pathologies (<17>, <45>, <53>, <54>). Triple label immunofluorescence for GFAP (astrocytes), pS422 tau, and HLA-DR (microglia) was used to determine whether the glial tau pathology in CTE was within astrocytes or microglia. Confocal imaging revealed clear colocalization between GFAP and pS422 in cell bodies of astrocytes (<Fig. 6A–D>), and threadlike astrocytic inclusions (<Fig. 6E–H>); by contrast, HLA-DR and pS422 were not colocalized. Moreover, numerous dot like structures in the neuropil, a feature commonly observed in CTE (<7>, <55>, <56>) were colabeled for GFAP and pS422, but not for HLA-DR (<Fig. 6I–L>).Immunohistochemistry was used to determine whether all 3 early tau markers were present in the typical astrocytic pathologies in CTE. The TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 antibodies primarily identified clusters of astrocytes in the cortical gray matter and labeled tau inclusions in the somata and processes of astrocytes (<Fig. 7>), as well as occasional coiled bodies (data not shown). Robust astrocytic tau pathology was present in perivascular areas in CTE (<Fig. 7D>). The tau-positive astrocytes had various morphologies with prominent dot-like astrocytic immunoreactivity clustered around small blood vessels and in the neuropil (<Fig. 7E-H>). All astrocytic pathologies were composed of PAD-exposed, oligomeric, and phospho-S422 tau, and infrequently with TauC3, consistent with the lower levels of neuronal TauC3 pathology in CTE (<Fig. 2>). Colocalization of TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 in astrocytes was determined using triple label immunofluorescence staining in CTE cases. All 3 tau markers showed extensive colocalization in astrocytic somata in CTE (<Fig. 8A–D>). Extensive colocalization between TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 was present in the perivascular tau pathology as well as the thread (<Fig. 8A–D>) and dot-like structures (<Fig. 8E–L>). These data suggest that the appearance of PAD-exposed tau, oligomeric tau, and phosphorylated S422 tau occurs simultaneously in astrocytes of CTE brains. We used a series of sandwich ELISAs with Tau5, TNT1, TOC1, or pS422 as the capture antibody to establish the levels of these tau forms in soluble and sarkosyl insoluble fractions in the frontal cortex from ND, CTE, and AD cases. In the soluble tau fraction, all groups showed signal for total tau in the Tau5 assay, but there were no overall significant differences among the groups (F3,19 = 2.855, p = 0.0644; <Fig. 9A>). The TNT1 and TOC1 assays with soluble tau showed a progressive, significant increase in signal from ND cases (little to no signal) to CTE II/III cases and then CTE IV cases, which had similar levels to those in Braak stage VI AD samples (TNT1: F3,19 = 56.54, p < 0.0001; TOC1: F3,19 = 88.36, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 9B, C>). The pS422 assay of soluble tau revealed a significant increase in CTE IV cases compared to ND and CTE II/III cases, whereas AD cases had significantly higher levels than all other groups (F3,19 = 45.96, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 9D>). TauC3 signal was highest in AD cases (0.041 ng/mL) in the soluble tau fraction compared to ND (0.0036 ng/mL), CTE II/III (0.0033 ng/mL) and CTE IV (0.0056 ng/mL), which reached statistical significance compared to ND and CTE II/III cases (F3,19 = 4.896, p = 0.011; <Fig. 9E>). The ND and CTE II/III cases showed low levels of total tau in the sarkosyl insoluble tau fraction in the Tau5 assay, while strong signal was detected in CTE IV and AD cases (F3,19 = 22.57, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 9E>). Both the TNT1 and TOC1 assays of insoluble tau showed progressive, significant increases in signal from ND to CTE II/III cases and then CTE IV cases, which had similar levels to those in AD samples (TNT1: F3,19 = 22.91, p < 0.0001; TOC1: F3,19 = 32.31, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 9F, G>). The pS422 assay of insoluble tau revealed little reactivity in ND controls and CTE II/III cases, and a significant increase in the CTE IV cases that were similar to levels in AD cases (F3,19 = 32.61, p < 0.0001; <Fig. 9H>). Finally, the TauC3 signal in the insoluble tau fraction was highest for AD cases (0.024 ng/mL) when compared to ND (0.0034 ng/mL), CTE II/III (0.0034 ng/mL), and CTE IV (0.0048 ng/mL), which reached statistical significance compared to ND and CTE II/III cases (F3,19 = 4.896, p = 0.011; <Fig. 9E>).Correlation analyses were used to establish the relationship between the levels of tau markers (ie, TNT1, TOC1, pS422, or TauC3) and either aging, disease stage, postmortem interval, or age of onset in CTE cases (<Table 2>). None of the tau markers used here correlated with age or age of onset, and only pS422 in the soluble fraction correlated with postmortem interval in CTE cases. Soluble total tau levels did not correlate with disease stage, but total tau levels in the insoluble fraction did correlate. TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 in both the soluble and insoluble fractions were strongly correlated with CTE stage (p < 0.05)."
PMC4891281_4,"The levels of TauC3 did not correlate with CTE stage in either the soluble or insoluble fractions  Finally, a correlational matrix was used to determine whether the tau markers used here are correlated with one another in CTE cases (<Supplementary Data 7>, correlation matrix of all tau markers). In the soluble tau fraction, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 correlated with each other, but Tau5 and TauC3 did not correlate with other markers. Within the insoluble tau fraction the following correlations were observed: Tau5 correlated with TOC1, pS422 and TauC3; TNT1 correlated with pS422; TOC1 correlated with pS422 and TauC3; and pS422 was correlated with TauC3. The levels of TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 in the soluble fraction were correlated with the levels of the same marker in the insoluble fraction. Over the past several years, significant attention has focused on CTE and the pathological features of this tauopathy (<10>). Preliminary neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE were proposed in 2013 (<3>, <43>); these were recently supported by a panel of expert neuropathologists as part of a U01 funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (1U01NS086659–01) (<1>). The majority of previous neuropathological studies have focused on common disease-relevant tau markers, such as PHF1 (pS396/ pS404), AT8 (phospho-S199/S202/T205), CP13 (phospho-S202) and silver staining (<6>–<10>). In addition, prior studies suggested that CTE tau pathology is a mixture of 4-repeat and 3-repeat tau and contains additional phosphoepitopes (pT181 and pT231) (<6>, <12>, <57>). However, the involvement of PAD-exposed, oligomeric, phospho-S422, and truncated tau pathology in CTE was not known.In the current work, we sought to identify whether some of the pathological changes in tau that characterize AD, including PAD exposure (ie, TNT1-reactive), oligomer formation (ie, TOC1-reactive), phosphorylation at serine 422 (ie, pS422-reactive), and D421 cleavage (ie, TauC3-reactive) (<14>, <16>, <22>–<26>), also exist in CTE. Tau pathology in CTE consists of a mixture of neuronal and astrocytic pathologies as previously noted with other tau markers (<6>–<10>). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that neuronal and astrocytic tau pathologies in CTE are composed of PAD-exposed, oligomeric, S422 phosphorylated tau, and D421 cleaved tau using immunohistochemical and biochemical assays. This extends previous work showing that TOC1 and pS422 colocalize in MCI and AD (<25>, <58>) and suggests these modifications occur simultaneously during the evolution of tau pathology in CTE. The tissue used in this study was from different tissue banks, but despite the differences in tissue origin, immunoreactivity was found with each antibody.The earliest phase of pathological tau formation in AD is the appearance of diffuse granular inclusions in the somatoden-dritic compartment in neurons, referred to as “early, pretangle” neurons (<50>–<52>). The appearance of pathological epitopes in these forms of pathology is sufficient to establish them as early, pretangle tau changes. Indeed, several pathological epitopes such as AT8 (<21>, <24>, <51>, <59>, <60>), pS422 (<15>–<17>), TNT1 (<23>, <24>), TOC1 (<25>), Alz50 (<13>, <14>, <18>, <21>, <61>), and pT231 (<18>, <21>, <62>) label the early diffuse granular inclusions in pretangle neurons in AD. These data are consistent with our findings in CTE, in which diffuse granular immunoreactivity for TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 appears to occur in the early phase of tau pathology. The next step in the formation of NFTs in AD is the appearance of some small compact inclusions within cells containing diffuse granular stains (<50>–<52>); again, the TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 immunoreactivity in several neurons followed this pattern in CTE. In the pretangle neurons, the tau pathology often extended long distances into the neural processes, a common feature of neurons containing early tau pathology (<50>–<52>). In AD, there is evidence of cleavage at D421 and the emergence of the TauC3 neoepitope (<14>, <22>). The TauC3 epitope can appear early in pretangle neurons (<19>, <21>), but appears after other earlier changes such as the Alz50 conformational change, as well as the pS422, AT8, and pT231 phosphoepitopes (<13>–<16>, <18>–<20>). Importantly, we found that cleavage of tau at D421 does not appear to be a major event in the evolution of tau pathology in the superior frontal gyrus of CTE brains. Notably, there is a report in the literature regarding the pS422 and AT8 tau epitopes that suggests they appear later during the evolution of tau inclusion maturation in AD (<63>). However, several other studies clearly depict these epitopes labeling pretangle neurons, supporting their early appearance, which is consistent with the data presented here with pS422 in CTE and previously with pS422 and AT8 in AD (<15>–<17>, <21>, <24>, <51>, <59>, <60>). The final step in NFT evolution is the appearance of “ghost tangles,” the extracellular remains of tangle-bearing neurons (<50>–<52>). As shown in AD (<15>–<17>, <23>–<25>), TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 continued to label more mature classic NFT tau pathology in CTE brains, but did not readily identify ghost tangles in CTE. Thus, we show that TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 appear as early, pretangle changes in CTE and their presence is continued as NFTs continue to mature, which is consistent with most previous reports describing their appearance in AD.We also showed that the primary glial pathology in CTE is in astrocytes not microglia. For these experiments, we used the pS422 marker as a representative stain because all 3 early tau markers were highly colocalized and because it is a rabbit antibody, pS422 is compatible with the anti-GFAP and anti-HLA-DR mouse antibodies for triple staining. Several morphologies of astrocytes containing tau pathology were observed with an abundance of dot-like structures in CTE (<7>, <55>, <56>), which were especially prominent in perivascular are as. The presence of robust astrocyte pathology suggests there may be overlapping mechanisms to other non-AD tauopathies that primarily involve astrocytic inclusions, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration (<54>). The repeated, mild head injuries that cause CTE may disrupt the blood-brain-barrier and facilitate inflammation and/or glial abnormalities that contribute to formation of glial tau inclusions, as well as the perivascular neuronal pathologies. Interestingly, microglia were not labeled with these tau markers, suggesting that microglia-associated phagocytosis of extracellular tau or endogenous microglial tau are not the source of glial inclusions in CTE.We confirmed the immunohistochemical findings by identifying the presence of PAD-exposed tau, oligomeric tau, pS422 tau, and C-terminal truncated tau biochemically in CTE and compared the findings to ND and AD. Only one previous study detailed the biochemical characteristics of tau in CTE (<12>) other than analysis of total tau levels (<11>). Schmidt et al demonstrated that tau isolated from 2 CTE (dementia pugilistica) cases contained all 6 tau isoforms, as well as phospho-serine 396 (T3P antibody) and phospho-threonine 231 (PHF6 antibody) tau species (<12>). In this study, we found that important conformation changes in tau (eg, PAD-exposed tau, oligomeric tau) and an early phosphoepitope (pS422), occur in CTE, and that these markers were well correlated with CTE staging. The TauC3 ELISA confirmed the IHC results showing little TauC3 in CTE (and ND) cases, and TauC3 did not correlate with CTE stage. The extensive colocalization between TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 was further confirmed using a correlational matrix comparison because all of these markers were strongly correlated with one another in the soluble fraction and insoluble fraction, (except insoluble TNT1 and TOC1). Interestingly, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 did not correlate with Tau5 or TauC3 in the soluble fraction suggesting the level of these forms of tau are not driven by total tau levels or related to C-terminal truncation in soluble tau."
PMC4891281_5,"The amounts of TNT1, TOC1, or pS422 in the soluble and insoluble fractions were well correlated, suggesting the presence of these modifications is linked between these 2 pools of tau species  Collectively, these data support a close relationship between PAD exposure, oligomer formation, and phosphorylation at S422 in CTE.A notable dissimilarity between CTE and ND cases was identified in the IHC and biochemical assays for TNT1, TOC1, or pS422. In the temporal cortex of ND cases, TNT1, TOC1, pS422, and TauC3-immunoreactive pathology was exceptionally sparse. The temporal cortex of ND cases was used primarily because this is an aging-vulnerable region of the brain for developing tau pathology. Thus, it is unlikely that the use of temporal lobe for ND and frontal cortex for CTE is responsible for the contrast between these cases. Our conclusion that these pathological forms of tau are present in CTE, but not ND cases, is further supported by the biochemical analyses of both the soluble and sarkosyl insoluble tau fractions from the frontal cortex of ND, CTE, and AD cases. The CTE II/III and CTE IV cases were positive for TNT1 or TOC1, which contrasted with little to no reactivity in the same brain region of ND controls. Interestingly, in this small sample set, none of the tau markers was correlated with age or age of onset among the CTE cases, suggesting that the CTE pathology is not driven primarily by age-related variables. Moreover, CTE IV cases had high levels of pS422 tau, while ND cases did not. These data support a clear distinction between CTE and normal age-related tau deposition. These assays also highlight biochemical similarities in some tau species in late-stage CTE (stage IV) and late-stage AD (Braak V–VI).The finding of TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 positive inclusions has important implications for the pathogenesis of tau pathology in CTE. Recently, we showed that PAD exposure is a mechanism by which tau can directly impair anterograde fast axonal transport (<23>, <24>, <27>), which could contribute to axonal dysfunction and eventually neurodegeneration (<31>, <64>). Axonal dysfunction is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury-related pathology and several lines of evidence from animal models, culture models, and human traumatic brain injury cases support a primary role for axonal dysfunction in posttraumatic neurodegeneration (<65>–<68>). In this study, we identified PAD-exposed tau, oligomeric tau, and phospho-S422 tau in the axonal pathologies of CTE. Notably, disease-related modifications, such as oligomer formation, are the mechanisms by which PAD becomes aberrantly exposed, suggesting that oligomeric tau is potentially neurotoxic through PAD-mediated pathways that disrupt axonal function in CTE. AT8 also labels early pretangle neurons in CTE (<6>) (as well as AD, [<21>, <24>, <51>, <60>, <61>]), and AT8 was recently identified as a modification that exposes PAD and disrupts axonal transport (<24>, <69>). Moreover, the toxicity of tau oligomers is currently a target of active investigation by many groups, and several studies using both animal and cell culture models support tau oligomers as a toxic form of tau (<29>, <34>, <36>, <37>, <70>, <71>). A recent report found tau oligomers in a fluid percussion model of traumatic brain injury in mice (<72>), and now we provide human tissue-based evidence that tau oligomers are present in CTE brains. Finally, the progressive deposition of pS422 reactive tau pathology in the cholinergic basal forebrain correlates well with progressive cognitive decline from ND to MCI and then AD (<15>). This suggests that pS422 is associated with neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD, and may also be related to cognitive decline or other functional impairments in individuals with CTE. Thus, the tau pathology in CTE brains also exists in forms that are likely contributing to axonal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in patients with CTE.In summary, we demonstrate PAD exposure, oligomer formation, and phosphorylation of S422 in the distinctive neuronal and astrocytic tau pathologies that characterize CTE using qualitative IHC and quantitative biochemistry. The work presented here further supports accumulating data demonstrating that CTE is a distinctive tauopathy that can be distinguished from AD and age-related tauopathy not only by the nature and distribution of the pathology, but by immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses. Previous work has established that both 4R and 3R isoforms of tau are found in CTE; more detailed biochemical characterization of isoform composition within TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 pathologies in CTE will be required to understand the contribution of each isoform to early tau pathology. Future studies identifying additional posttranslational modifications and the chronological ordering of various forms of tau in several brain regions during CTE progression may provide important insights into mechanisms of CTE pathogenesis after traumatic injury and potential targets for tau-based therapeutic interventions. Similarly, the phosphoepitopes that coexist with PAD-exposed and/or oligomeric tau may provide further insight into the posttranslational modifications that facilitate conformational changes in CTE that might contribute to pathogenesis. Finally, studies that correlate the progression of tau pathological changes to clinical outcome measures will help determine the contribution of tau abnormalities to the clinical manifestations of CTE. rhetorical FIGURE 1 Antibodies to TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 label tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Notably, the TNT1 (A, E), TOC1 (B, F), and pS422(C, G) tau pathology in CTE and AD included extensive neuropil threads and neurofibrillary tangles. In contrast, TNT1 (I), TOC1 (J), or pS422 (K) labeled very little to no pathology in the temporal lobe of ND control cases. The TauC3 marker was relatively sparse in CTE (D), yet abundant in AD (H) and very low in ND (L) cases. Note that the ND images are taken at a lower magnification to show larger areas and the very low levels of immunoreactivity.

The tau immunostaining in these neurons is diffuse and granular (arrows in A, C, E) with some small compact inclusions (asterisk in C, E). In these early forms of tau pathology, there are often TNT1 (B)-, TOC1 (D)-, and pS422 (F)-immunoreactive inclusions that extend far into processes (arrowheads in B, D, F). These patterns of staining show that TNT1, TOC1, and pS422 label early, pretangle tau pathology in CTE, and that these modifications occur early in the evolution of the tau abnormalities."

(A–E) Sandwich ELISAs were used to quantify soluble tau fractions for total tau (Tau5 capture) (A), PAD-exposed tau (TNT1 capture) (B), tau oligomers (TOC1 capture) (C), pS422 tau (pS422 capture) (D), and C-terminal truncated tau (TauC3 capture) (E). As expected, the soluble fraction contained substantial tau proteins in all groups (A), overall significance was not reached between groups (p = 0.0644). Both TNT1- and TOC1-reactive tau species are progressively increased in CTE II/III and then CTE IV subjects, the latter of which were similar to the values in the AD cases. pS422 tau was undetectable/very low in ND and CTE II/III cases (D), but significantly increased in CTE IV and further increased in AD cases. AD cases contained the highest levels of TauC3 (rv8 times the amount in ND, CTE II/III, and IV cases), which reached statistical significance compared to ND and CTE II/III cases (E). (F–J) Sandwich ELISAs of sarkosyl insoluble tau fractions for total tau (F), PAD-exposed tau (G), tau oligomers (H), pS422 tau (I), and TauC3 (J) showed similar results as soluble tau, with the exceptions that total tau was significantly elevated in CTE IV and AD cases compared to ND and CTE II/III cases; similar levels of pS422 were present in CTE IV and AD cases. These data suggest that PAD-exposed and oligomeric tau progressively accumulates in CTE, pS422 is robustly increased in CTE IV, and that CTE cases have very low levels of TauC3, similar to ND cases. *p < 0.05 vs ND; **p < 0.05 vs ND and CTE II/III; ***p < 0.05 vs ND, CTE II/III, and CTE IV.

PMC4891281_7,"Several lines of evidence in other tauopathies suggest that tau oligomer formation induces neurotoxicity and that tau oligomer-mediated neurotoxicity involves induction of axonal dysfunction through exposure of an N-terminal motif in tau, the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD)  Additionally, phosphorylation at serine 422 in tau occurs early and correlates with cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We performed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on fixed brain sections and biochemical analysis of fresh brain extracts to characterize the presence of PAD-exposed tau (TNT1 antibody), tau oligomers (TOC1 antibody), tau phosphorylated at S422 (pS422 antibody), and tau truncated at D421 (TauC3 antibody) in the brains of 9-11 cases with CTE and cases of nondemented aged controls and AD (Braak VI) (n = 6, each). All 3 early tau markers (ie, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422) were present in CTE and displayed extensive colocalization in perivascular tau lesions that are considered diagnostic for CTE. Notably, the TauC3 epitope, which is abundant in AD, was relatively sparse in CTE. Together, these results provide the first description of PAD exposure, TOC1 reactive oligomers, phosphorylation of S422, and TauC3 truncation in the tau pathology of CTE. ."
PMC5744016_0,"The ATP-dependent 90 kDa heat shock protein, Hsp90, is a major regulator of protein triage, from assisting in nascent protein folding to refolding or degrading aberrant proteins. Tau, a microtubule associated protein, aberrantly accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, deemed tauopathies. Hsp90 binds to and regulates tau fate in coordination with a diverse group of co-chaperones. Imbalances in chaperone levels and activity, as found in the aging brain, can contribute to disease onset and progression. For example, the levels of the Hsp90 co-chaperone, FK506-binding protein 51 kDa (FKBP51), progressively increase with age. In vitro and in vivo tau models demonstrated that FKBP51 synergizes with Hsp90 to increase neurotoxic tau oligomer production. Inversely, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which dephosphorylates tau to restore microtubule-binding function, is repressed with aging and activity is further repressed in AD. Similarly, levels of cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) are reduced in the aged brain and further repressed in AD. Interestingly, CyP40 was shown to breakup tau aggregates in vitro and prevent tau-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. Moreover, the only known stimulator of Hsp90 ATPase activity, Aha1, increases tau aggregation and toxicity. While the levels of Aha1 are not significantly altered with aging, increased levels have been found in AD brains. Overall, these changes in the Hsp90 heterocomplex could drive tau deposition and neurotoxicity. While the relationship of tau and Hsp90 in coordination with these co-chaperones is still under investigation, it is clear that imbalances in these proteins with aging can contribute to disease onset and progression. This review highlights the current understanding of how the Hsp90 family of molecular chaperones regulates tau or other misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases with a particular emphasis on the impact of aging. Aging is the biggest risk factor for developing a neurodegenerative disease, but the specific factors which cause these predominantly sporadic diseases are still under investigation (Reeve et al., <2014>). As cells within the body age, the cellular homeostasis network must deal with an increasing amount of misfolded and aggregated proteins that can pathogenically accumulate leading to cell death. Aging is caused by compromised cellular homeostasis, fitness, and plasticity, leading to degeneration and cell death in vital organs. According to the “garbage catastrophe” hypothesis, aged differentiated cells lose the capacity to dispose of damaged and malfunctioning proteins (Terman, <2001>). Such damaged proteins can assume cytotoxic properties, and their constant removal is thus essential for cell survival. Not only does aging lead to an increased likelihood of protein misfolding and aggregation, it is compounded by a decrease in the efficiency of the protein degradation machinery. The activity of both the proteasome, which is the main mechanism of protein degradation (Rock et al., <1994>; Conconi et al., <1996>), and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA; Cuervo and Dice, <2000b>) is significantly impaired with aging and is especially pronounced in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, potentially resulting in neurodegenerative disease (Terman, <2001>). Fortunately, there is a system in place to help the body maintain proteostasis in times of stress and disease: the molecular chaperone network (Söti and Csermely, <2002>). This network is comprised of a diverse family of proteins which contains members that are constitutively expressed to help in normal cell maintenance as well as members that become activated during times of stress. All of these chaperones assist in various ways to help fold, refold and degrade misfolded proteins.The molecular chaperone network is comprised of diverse families of heat shock proteins (Hsps) that are divided based on their molecular mass. The small Hsps regulate general protein aggregation, Hsp40s regulate Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis, Hsp70 folds proteins during translation, and Hsp90 maintains and triages a subset of clients (Liberek et al., <2008>; Miyata et al., <2011>). While Hsp70 and Hsp90 perform many overlapping roles in the cell, Hsp90 shows more client selectivity. Hsp90 requires ATP to perform these functions including protein degradation, protein folding, prevention of protein aggregation, and protein modification (Echeverría et al., <2011>). These regulatory processes are particularly important for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) which have a high propensity to aggregate (Schopf et al., <2017>).Hsp90 binds to one of these IDPs, tau, in a broad region that includes aggregation prone areas (Karagöz et al., <2014>). Tau normally functions to stabilize the microtubules and regulate axonal transport (Guo et al., <2017>). The pathological accumulation of tau is a hallmark in several neurodegenerative disorders collectively termed tauopathies (Kovacs, <2015>); a series of diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Pick's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE; Guo et al., <2017>). Currently there are no treatment options available which regulate tau pathogenesis (Orr et al., <2017>), therefore more work needs to be done to identify potential tau regulating therapeutic strategies.A promising avenue to target tau is through Hsp90 inhibition. In fact, Hsp90 ATPase-inhibitors rapidly degrade tau aggregates in vivo (Dickey et al., <2007a>; Luo et al., <2007>), but these inhibitors have not yet been successful in clinical trials due to lack of efficacy and associated toxicities (Bhat et al., <2014>; Renouf et al., <2016>; Thakur et al., <2016>). However, Hsp90 regulates tau and other aggregating proteins in coordination with a diverse group of co-chaperones (Schopf et al., <2017>). In fact, the levels of many of these co-chaperones have been shown to change with aging, which can alter the fate of tau and potentially contribute to disease onset or severity (Blair et al., <2013>; Brehme et al., <2014>). It is possible that a more successful treatment strategy may be found by a therapeutic aimed toward regulating these co-chaperones or Hsp90/co-chaperone heterocomplexes (Kamal et al., <2003>; Rodina et al., <2016>). This review discusses the involvement of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones in disease and how alterations in levels and activity with aging can affect this process (Table <1>). Current Hsp90 therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases will also be reviewed.

Current Hsp90 therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases will also be reviewed. Hsp90 is critical to maintaining proteostasis (Brehme et al., <2014>) and accounts for up to 6% of all protein within the cell during times of stress (Picard, <2002>; Prodromou, <2016>). Hsp90 consists of three domains: an N-terminal ATP-binding domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal domain responsible for the inherent dimerization of the protein (Li and Buchner, <2013>). Hsp90 requires ATP in order to dimerize and properly assist in protein folding. The Hsp90 ATPase cycle consists of four stages: the ATP-bound state, an initial intermediate state (I1), a second intermediate state (I2), and finally a closed state in which ATP hydrolysis occurs (Li and Buchner, <2013>). There are several different isoforms of Hsp90, however this review will only focus on Hsp90 in the cytosol, which includes Hsp90α (stress-inducible) and Hsp90β (constitutively active) (Li et al., <2012>).The two different cytosolic forms of Hsp90 are 86% genetically identical and have 93% amino acid sequence homology, showing lots of similarities in structure and function. However, there are some differences that set these two isoforms apart. The first difference is the viability of Hsp90 knock-out mice. Mice lacking Hsp90β are embryonically lethal and do not survive past day 9, whereas mice lacking Hsp90α are viable but leads to sterility in male mouse (Table <2>; Voss et al., <2000>; Grad et al., <2010>). There are also some differences in the cellular functions of Hsp90α and Hsp90β. Hsp90α is involved in growth promotion, cell cycle regulation, stress-induced cytoprotection, and cancer cell invasiveness; whereas Hsp90β is involved with early embryonic development, germ cell maturation, cytoskeletal stabilization, cellular transformation, signal transduction, and long-term cell adaptation (Eustace et al., <2004>; Sreedhar et al., <2004>). While there are some general functional differences between the two cytosolic isoforms more studies are needed to better understand the role of these different isoforms on tau pathology.

There are two main categories of Hsp90 co-chaperones: tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) and non-TPR containing (Prodromou et al., <2000>). Therefore, changes in Hsp90 levels are part of a larger imbalance in the chaperone network which contribute to aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders. TPR-containing Hsp90 co-chaperones interact with the C-terminal MEEVD peptide motif on Hsp90 (Li et al., <2012>). Since Hsp90 functions as a dimer, two TPR-containing co-chaperones could interact simultaneously. However, these interactions are dependent on the isoform of Hsp90 and the repertoire of expressed co-chaperones. In fact, co-chaperones do compete for binding to Hsp90 (Harst et al., <2005>; Hildenbrand et al., <2011>). This competition can have beneficial or detrimental effects on tau pathology. Known examples include co-chaperones which interact with Hsp90 to promote the degradation of aberrant tau or others which drive tau oligomerization and aggregation. Therefore, an imbalance in protein levels with aging and AD compound this already complex competition for binding Hsp90 to regulate tau fate (Figure <1>). Here, we will describe these TPR-co-chaperones, and how their interaction with Hsp90 regulates tau. rhetorical Figure 1 Schematic depicting fate of tau following Hsp90 interaction with distinct co-chaperone; the impact of Alzheimer's disease on the levels of co-chaperones. Aha1 and FKBP51 protein levels are induced in AD, and their association to tau leads to increased aggregation. Whereas, CyP40 and PP5 levels are repressed in AD, and their association to tau leads to reduced tau aggregation. This schematic highlights the important role of co-chaperones in AD. TPR-containing Hsp90 co-chaperones interact with the C-terminal MEEVD peptide motif on Hsp90 (Li et al., <2012>). Since Hsp90 functions as a dimer, two TPR-containing co-chaperones could interact simultaneously. However, these interactions are dependent on the isoform of Hsp90 and the repertoire of expressed co-chaperones. In fact, co-chaperones do compete for binding to Hsp90 (Harst et al., <2005>; Hildenbrand et al., <2011>). This competition can have beneficial or detrimental effects on tau pathology. Known examples include co-chaperones which interact with Hsp90 to promote the degradation of aberrant tau or others which drive tau oligomerization and aggregation. Therefore, an imbalance in protein levels with aging and AD compound this already complex competition for binding Hsp90 to regulate tau fate (Figure <1>). Here, we will describe these TPR-co-chaperones, and how their interaction with Hsp90 regulates tau. Hsp90 interacts with six immunophilins that display peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity through TPR domains including cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) and five FK506-binding proteins: FKBP51, FKBP52, FKBP36, FKBP38, FKBPL/WISp39 (Jascur et al., <2005>; Jarczowski et al., <2009>; Guy et al., <2015>; Blundell et al., <2017>). These PPIases regulate the twisting of proline bonds through stabilization of the cis-trans transition state and accelerate the isomerization process. This is particularly important for tau, which has 40 proline residues that regulate phosphorylation and aggregation propensity (Mandelkow and Mandelkow, <2012>). Hsp90 also interacts with two immunophilin homologs: protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and XAP2/FKBP37. Altered levels of many of these immunophilins and immunophilin-like proteins have been found in aging and AD (Table <1>), which could skew the competition dynamics for Hsp90 binding (discussed later in this review) and may promote toxic tau accumulation. An interesting PPIase, CyP40, decreases in aging and is further repressed in AD (Table <1>; Brehme et al., <2014>)."
PMC5744016_3,"CyP40 was recently shown to disaggregate tau fibrils in vitro and prevents toxic tau accumulation in vivo preserving memory, demonstrating a neuroprotective role for CyP40 in the brain (Baker et al , <2017>). The PPIase activity of CyP40 is slightly repressed when bound to Hsp90, but under cellular stress CyP40 can release from Hsp90 increasing its isomerase and chaperone activity (Blackburn et al., <2015>). However, as CyP40 levels decrease with aging, it is possible that the pool of free CyP40 is not sufficient to help disentangle aggregating proteins, like tau. Contrary to the neuroprotective effects of CyP40, two FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) have been shown to stimulate toxic tau aggregation (Blair et al., <2013>; Giustiniani et al., <2015>; Kamah et al., <2016>). One of these, FKBP51, coordinates with Hsp90 to preserve toxic tau oligomers in vivo (Blair et al., <2013>). In fact, mice lacking FKBP51 have decreased tau levels in the brain (Jinwal et al., <2010>; Blair et al., <2013>). However, throughout aging, FKBP51 levels progressively increase and are further increased in AD brain samples (Table <1>; Blair et al., <2013>; Sabbagh et al., <2014>). Previous studies have also shown that FKBP51 can form complexes with tau in both human AD brain samples and control samples (Jinwal et al., <2010>). Additionally, this study showed that FKBP51 was able to stabilize microtubules, suggesting a novel and unique function for FKBP51 (Jinwal et al., <2010>). Taken together, the increase in FKBP51 in aging and AD suggest that targeting FKBP51 could offer a potential therapeutic strategy for tauopathies such as AD. FKBP52 interacts both physically and functionally with tau and promotes tau aggregation in vitro (Giustiniani et al., <2015>; Meduri et al., <2016>). FKBP52 induces oligomers from both P301L and truncated wild-type tau. Interestingly, this oligomerization is not due to the PPIase activity of FKBP52, instead the oligomerization of tau appears to occur via molecular interaction (Kamah et al., <2016>). FKBP52 can also induce aggregation of a truncated form of tau that appears to have prion like behavior, suggesting a possible mechanism for the spread of tau pathology throughout the brain in diseases such as AD (Giustiniani et al., <2015>). However, it is interesting to note that FKBP52 levels are lower in the cortex of AD patients' brains (Table <1>; Brehme et al., <2014>; Meduri et al., <2016>). There are several other FKBPs that act as co-chaperones to Hsp90 including FKBP36, FKBP38, and FKBPL (WISp39), however their relationship to tau, if any, is still unknown at this point and so they will not be discussed in detail. XAP2, otherwise known as FKBP37 or Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP), contains a PPIase homologous domain. While a direct role of XAP2 in tau pathogenesis has not been described, studies have shown that XAP2 is activated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6, which has been linked to pathogenic tau (Kekatpure et al., <2009>; Cook et al., <2012>; Selenica et al., <2014>). In addition, XAP2 coordinates with Hsp90 to regulate glucocorticoid receptor signaling (Laenger et al., <2009>), which has also been implicated in the production of pathogenic tau (Pinheiro et al., <2016>). Additional studies are needed to determine the direct or indirect effects of XAP2 on tau pathology. Another member of this family, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), is repressed in aging. PP5 is contains a PPIase homology domain, but does not display classical PPIase activity, since it can bind FK506 (Silverstein et al., <1997>). Instead, PP5 acts as a Ser/Thr phosphatase, which activates when bound to Hsp90 (Conde et al., <2005>). PP5 activity has been shown to be repressed in AD (Table <1>; Liu et al., <2005>). Studies have shown that PP5 is able to dephosphorylate tau at several phosphorylation sites connected to AD pathology (Gong et al., <2004>). Further studies are needed to better understand if the upregulation of PP5 could be used to slow or prevent tau pathogenesis. The Hsp70-Hsp90 organizing protein, otherwise known as Hop and sometimes STIP1 (stress inducible protein 1), is involved in helping transfer client proteins from the early stages of protein maturation involving Hsp70 and Hsp40 to the later stages of the cycle involving Hsp90 (Baindur-Hudson et al., <2015>). As such, Hop plays a crucial role in the maturation of client proteins, like tau. A previous study found that when Hop was depleted using siRNA, there was an accumulation of tau (Jinwal et al., <2013>). This suggests that Hop is necessary for tau clearance via Hsp70/Hsp90. In fact, loss-of-function mutations in Hop drive toxic tau accumulation in a fly model of tauopathy (Ambegaokar and Jackson, <2011>). Together these studies demonstrate a protective role of Hop in a tauopathic brain. C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is highly involved in the Hsp70-Hsp90 machinery acting not only as a co-chaperone, but also as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (Edkins, <2015>). CHIP has many roles within the cell including stress-response activation, protein triage, and restitution of the stress response (Dickey et al., <2007b>). CHIP has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and AD as well as other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer (Dickey et al., <2007b>; Edkins, <2015>). In tauopathic mice, CHIP regulates the removal of tau species that have undergone abnormal phosphorylation and folding (Dickey et al., <2007b>). Additionally, silencing CHIP via siRNA, led to a massive increase in tau levels (Dickey et al., <2008>). Similarly, CHIP/Stub1-knockout mice have increased accumulation of phospho- and total tau species (Table <2>; Palubinsky et al., <2015>). Overexpression of CHIP could represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent neuronal cell death and improve outcomes of neurodegenerative diseases by promoting the degradation of tau. DnaJC7, also known as Tpr2, simultaneously binds Hsp70 and Hsp90 via its two TPR domains (Brychzy et al., <2003>). To date, a link between DnaJC7 and tau has not been investigated. However, it is known that DnaJC7 plays an important role in steroid receptor chaperoning, as well as recycling substrates from Hsp90 back to Hsp70 via this unique TPR interaction (Brychzy et al., <2003>; Moffatt et al., <2008>). Additional studies are needed to understand if DnaJC7 regulates tau pathogenesis. Tom34 is a co-chaperone involved in mitochondrial protein import. One study found that in Drosophila, impaired Tom34 gene function led to enhanced tau pathology (Ambegaokar and Jackson, <2011>). Conversely, the same study demonstrated Tom34 overexpression was able to suppress tau toxicity elucidating a role for Tom34 in tau pathology in Drosophila. The mechanism by which Tom34 promotes tau pathology remains unclear. It is possible that mitochondrial dysfunction could lead to cellular stress which, in turn, could enhance tau pathology. Additional studies are needed to fully elucidate this interaction.In addition, there are other TPR-containing Hsp90 co-chaperones such as UNC-45, Tom70, NASP, SGTA, SGTB, Cns1, CRN, Tah1, TPR1, DYX1C1, and AIPL1. However, very little is known about most of these co-chaperones in the brain and even less is known about their interactions with tau, therefore they will not be discussed in detail in this review. Cell division cycle 37 (Cdc37) slows the ATPase activity of Hsp90 allowing a prolonged interaction between Hsp90 and its client proteins (Cox and Johnson, <2011>). Cdc37 is also required for the stable folding of protein kinases in coordination with Hsp90 (Calderwood, <2015>). Many of these kinases are known to phosphorylate tau at sites associated with AD, such as GSK3β and MAPK13 (Taipale et al., <2012>; Jin et al., <2016>). Interestingly, overexpression of Cdc37 preserves tau, and its suppression reduces tau (Jinwal et al., <2012>). However, additional studies are needed to better understand the dynamics between Cdc37 and tau phosphorylation."
PMC5744016_4,"The activator of Hsp90 ATPase homolog 1 (Aha1) works as a co-chaperone to stimulate the ATPase function of Hsp90 to regulate the folding and activation of client proteins  Aha1 interacts with Hsp90 independent of its nucleotide status and allows the Hsp90 ATPase cycle to skip the I1 phase, thus accelerating the progression of the ATPase cycle dramatically (Li and Buchner, <2013>; Wolmarans et al., <2016>). Aha1 levels have been shown to increase with AD. In fact, we have found that Aha1 levels in the medial temporal gyrus of human brain correlated with increased tau Braak staging (Shelton et al., <2017>). In the same study, we found that high levels of Aha1 in a tau transgenic mouse model increased tau oligomers as well as neuronal loss concomitant with cognitive deficits (Shelton et al., <2017>). Since Aha1 levels are repressed in aging, but are abnormally preserved in AD, tau aggregation could be accelerated in part by Aha1 in the AD brain. Previous studies have also implicated Aha1 for a role in cystic fibrosis. In fact, one study showed that knockdown of Aha1 promotes the translocation of the disease-related mutant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor, CFTR, to the plasma membrane, allowing it to properly function (Wang et al., <2006>). Thus, treatments which reduce Aha1 may be beneficial for both AD and cystic fibrosis. p23 has an opposing effect on Hsp90 compared to Aha1. p23 works by inhibiting the ATPase activity of Hsp90. The interaction between Hsp90 and p23 is nucleotide-dependent meaning that p23 can only interact with Hsp90 when ATP is bound (Sullivan et al., <1997>). p23 works in a unique way to inhibit ATPase activity, it can either inhibit the hydrolysis process or it can impede the release of ADP and Pi (Rehn and Buchner, <2015>). As a co-chaperone, p23 works to suppress protein aggregation and exhibits chaperoning activity, although p23 is not able to refold proteins on its own (Freeman et al., <1996>). Inhibition of p23 in an siRNA screen of Hsp90 co-chaperones showed that silencing p23 reduced both total and phospho-tau (Jinwal et al., <2012>, <2013>). p23 also plays an important role in preventing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death, which can be triggered by misfolded proteins, like tau (Rao et al., <2006>; Abisambra et al., <2013>). However, p23 can be cleaved during ER stress-induced cell death into a smaller p19 fragment which is then unable to exert its anti-apoptotic effects (Zhang et al., <2013>). A mutant p23 (p23D142N) that is uncleavable was shown to ameliorate the ER stress-induced cell death in vitro and suggests that this mutant p23 could be a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang et al., <2013>). S100 calcium-binding protein A1 (S100A1) interacts with Hsp90. One study used siRNA to screen several Hsp90 co-chaperones to investigate the effect on tau. This study found that reductions in S100A1 also led to massive reductions in both phospho- and total tau levels in cells (Jinwal et al., <2013>). S100A1 could play a role in stabilizing tau, thus leading to a worsening of tau pathology. Therefore, silencing or knocking down S100A1 could offer a potential therapeutic strategy for tauopathies. The folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) is able to interact with Hsp90 as a co-chaperone in order to inhibit its ATPase activity. One study found that FNIP1, in complex with FNIP2 and Hsp90, was able to stabilize the tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN; Woodford et al., <2016>). FNIP1 was shown to interact directly with Hsp90, and it can also interact with other co-chaperones such as p23, Hop and Cdc37 (Woodford et al., <2016>). FNIP1 was also shown to compete for binding with Aha1 suggesting an important role for FNIP1 in the Hsp90 chaperone network (Woodford et al., <2016>). Additional studies are needed to determine if FNIP1 could regulate tau directly or potentially through competition with Aha1 to bind Hsp90 and alter its ATPase activity. All of the above mentioned co-chaperones interact with Hsp90 in order to form diverse heterocomplexes, however, changes in Hsp90 expression with aging can alter their composition. There is conflicting data on Hsp90 levels with age in both human and animal studies. One study focused on the basal levels of cytosolic Hsp90 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and found that in aged human samples there was an increase in Hsp90 under normal physiological conditions when compared to young samples (Njemini et al., <2007>). Another study had similar findings in the hippocampus of aged gerbils. This study demonstrated that cytosolic Hsp90 levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus of aged gerbils (24 months) compared to adult gerbils (6 months) (Lee et al., <2011>). Conversely, there are also studies showing decreased levels of Hsp90 in aged human brain samples. For instance, two other studies investigated the levels of chaperone proteins in the human brain. One study found that cytosolic Hsp90 was repressed in the superior frontal gyrus, while another demonstrated a similar repression in the prefrontal cortex of aged patients compared to controls (Berchtold et al., <2008>; Loerch et al., <2008>; Brehme et al., <2014>). Taken together, this data suggests that alterations in Hsp90 levels do not occur uniformly and that changes in the expression of Hsp90 with aging may vary between cell types and brain regions (Berchtold et al., <2008>). While Hsp90 protein levels are an important factor with aging, co-chaperone expression levels could be equally important in heterocomplex formation.In addition to the differences in expression levels of Hsp90, there are also changes in expression levels of co-chaperone proteins during the aging process. Almost all of the Hsp90 co-chaperones are repressed in aging, suggesting that these proteins could play important roles in maintaining homeostasis within the cell (Brehme et al., <2014>). For instance, CyP40, FKBP52, PP5, Hop, p23, and Aha1 are all repressed in the aged brain. All of these proteins are integral to the Hsp90 chaperone system and when levels of these proteins go down the Hsp90 chaperone network can no longer function normally, which can lead to an increased risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease. Interestingly, one co-chaperone is significantly induced in the aged brain and that is FKBP51. FKBP51 has several important roles within the cell including immunoregulation as well as helping with protein folding and trafficking in complex with Hsp90. Because FKBP51 is induced in aging, while many other co-chaperones are reduced, this suggests that the imbalance seen in these proteins during aging could lead to completely different Hsp90 heterocomplexes resulting in the dysfunction of cellular homeostasis during aging.Hsp90 is able to form many unique heterocomplexes with different co-chaperones in order to regulate protein triage. Hsp90 heterocomplexes are unique in that there is usually a specific progression of co-chaperones that interact with Hsp90 (Schopf et al., <2017>). One interesting aspect to these heterocomplexes is the fact that Hsp90 can bind multiple co-chaperones simultaneously. One study found that Hsp90 could form stable complexes with Hsp90, FKBP52, Hop, and p23 (Hildenbrand et al., <2011>). There does appear to be a hierarchy though, with some co-chaperones able to bind more strongly than others. For example, Aha1 has been shown to compete with Hop, FNIP1, and p23 for the ability to bind with Hsp90 (Harst et al., <2005>; Woodford et al., <2016>). These competition dynamics between Aha1 and p23/FNIP1 suggest that there is a constant battle for control of the ATPase activity of Hsp90. Additionally, FKBP51 and FKBP52 have been shown to have greater relative binding to Hsp90 compared to other TPR co-chaperones (Schülke et al., <2010>). While not as strong as FKBP51 and FKBP52, PP5 forms more complexes with Hsp90 than most other TPR co-chaperones."
PMC5744016_5,"Taken together, increased FKBP51 and decreased PP5 and CyP40 could contribute to an imbalance in Hsp90 heterocomplexes which may promote increased tau phosphorylation and aggregation causing neurotoxicity (Blair et al , <2013>). This suggests an even more complex system in place because depending on the amount of certain co-chaperones and their relative ability to bind to Hsp90; certain maladaptive complexes could be more abundant than others with aging.In addition to altering Hsp90 heterocomplex composition and client selection, altered Hsp90 co-chaperone expression can interfere with degradation of aberrant proteins via the proteasome or autophagy. As mentioned above, aged cells are often inundated with misfolded and aggregated proteins, which can overload the Hsp90 chaperone network causing a negative spiral where there are not enough healthy chaperone molecules to refold or degrade aberrant proteins. In addition to the problems faced with an overwhelmed chaperone network, the proteolytic activity of the proteasome also declines with aging, and in fact Hsp90 has been shown to protect the proteasome from age-related, oxidative-dependent decline (Conconi and Friguet, <1997>). However, with advanced aging, the association between Hsp90 and the proteasome drastically decreases (Conconi et al., <1996>). This suggests that because the Hsp90 chaperone system and the proteasome are so connected, when one starts to fail the other will fail as well leading to cytotoxicity and cell death. Proteins can also be degraded by CMA; however, CMA activity also decreases with age (Cuervo and Dice, <2000a>). Hsp90 and Hop are both involved in the CMA system; helping to unfold the target substrate before it can translocate into the lysosome for degradation. As mentioned previously, both Hsp90 and Hop are repressed in aging and therefore may not be able to assist in the translocation of substrates, leading to a buildup of misfolded or aggregated proteins. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Hsp90 can also complicate the matter further.There are many different PTMs that can affect Hsp90 including phosphorylation, acetylation, S-nitrosylation, oxidation, and ubiquitination; and all of these PTMs can impact the chaperoning function of Hsp90. Phosphorylation of Hsp90 leads to reduced chaperoning ability and phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues can affect the ability of Hsp90 to interact with distinct client proteins (Zhao et al., <2001>; Mollapour and Neckers, <2012>). Acetylation of Hsp90 affects client protein interaction and also decreases binding of Hsp90 to ATP (Yu et al., <2002>; Mollapour and Neckers, <2012>). S-nitrosylation, oxidation and ubiquitination also inhibit Hsp90 chaperone activity (Blank et al., <2003>; Martínez-Ruiz et al., <2005>; Chen et al., <2008>). These PTMs increase with aging and can alter the ability of Hsp90 to function properly as well as change the ability of different co-chaperones to bind. As the chaperone network declines with aging, so does the ability of the cell to recover from damaged proteins and stress, thus leading to an environment which promotes aberrant protein accumulation and neurotoxicity. Inhibition of the ATPase activity of Hsp90 has been shown to have positive outcomes in cell culture and animal models of tauopathy. Hsp90 ATPase inhibitors have been developed to target each of the three domains; with the majority of Hsp90 inhibitors targeting the N-terminal domain (Bhat et al., <2014>). Inhibition of Hsp90 induces the expression of protective chaperones, Hsp70 and Hsp40, further promoting the degradation of aberrant proteins (Carman et al., <2013>). Previous studies have shown that Hsp90 inhibition decreased the levels of hyperphosphorylated and/or mutated tau species both in cells and mice. The Hsp90 N-terminal domain inhibitor, EC102, was used to demonstrate degradation of hyperphosphorylated pathologically relevant tau in cells (Dickey et al., <2007a>). Another N-terminal Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor, 17-AAG, was shown to decrease levels of phosphorylated tau in cells, and a related N-terminal Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor, PU-DZ8, reduced soluble and insoluble tau in tauP301L mice (Luo et al., <2007>). Although Hsp90 inhibitors have been in clinical development since 1999, none have reached New Drug Application (NDA) status (Bhat et al., <2014>). All of these clinical trials were focused on investigating Hsp90 inhibitors on various cancers. Hsp90 plays a similar role in both neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, however because of the complexity of the brain and the need for a blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable drug, the clinical development of Hsp90 inhibitors for neurodegenerative diseases has been even less successful. While the development of Hsp90 inhibitors is still underway, it is possible that the development of therapeutics which target Hsp90 heterocomplexes or discrete Hsp90 co-chaperones could open up additional avenues for success in developing a BBB-permeable drug.In addition to offering more potential therapeutic targets, small molecules which modify Hsp90/co-chaperone interactions may also show more specificity for a specific pool of Hsp90 which may reduce the number of on-target side effects. There are very few Hsp90 co-chaperone targeting small molecules, and of these, only a handful of these have been investigated for their role in effecting tau. There is a Hop/Hsp90 complex specific inhibitor, C9, however, there is no available data on how chemical inhibition of this complex affects tau accumulation (Pimienta et al., <2011>). The Cdc37/Hsp90 inhibitors, Celasterol and Withaferin A (Zhang et al., <2008>; Yu et al., <2010>), reduce tau levels and a new compound, platycodin D has just been discovered (Li et al., <2017>). Platycodin D does not affect the ATPase activity of Hsp90, but instead disrupts the interaction between Hsp90 and Cdc37 leading to client protein degradation without an increase in Hsp70 (Li et al., <2017>). More work still needs to be done to better understand the role of Cdc37 in tau phosphorylation to determine if targeting this complex is of therapeutic benefit. Developing drugs to target discrete FKBPs has been challenging due to their homology, however, despite their structural similarity they do display differences in conformational flexibility which could be a way to potentially target specific FKBPs in the future (LeMaster and Hernandez, <2015>). Interestingly, one study demonstrated that patients chronically treated with FK506, which inhibits the PPIase domain of many of the FKBPs, significantly reduced the incidence of AD (Taglialatela et al., <2015>). The targeting FKBP51 is of great interest for the treatment of tauopathies as well as mood disorders (Zannas and Binder, <2014>). Recently a PPIase antagonist has been developed which shows selectivity for FKBP51, but additional studies are needed to determine if targeting the PPIase domain of FKBP51 will be effective in regulating tau accumulation (Jinwal et al., <2010>). There is one compound, MJC13, which targets the FKBP52-Hsp90-androgen receptor complex (De Leon et al., <2011>). MJC13 results in a reduced stress response which has demonstrated therapeutic potential in cancer, but so far MJC13 has not been investigated for a role in tau pathology (De Leon et al., <2011>). Additionally, Aha1-specific inhibitors have been recently developed (Hall et al., <2014>). One of these inhibitors, KU-177, reduced insoluble tauP301L levels in cells (Shelton et al., <2017>). While this is an exciting result, more studies are needed to determine if Aha1 inhibitors regulate tau similarly in vivo. There is still much to be done to develop compounds which target the Hsp90 chaperone network, but there are a lot of promising leads which can be targeted to develop disease-modifying therapeutics. The Hsp90 chaperone machinery plays a huge role in both aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Hsp90 is one of the most highly expressed proteins in the cell and is involved in a myriad of cellular processes. Previous work has focused on inhibition of Hsp90 to triage misfolded proteins."
PMC5744016_6,"There are also many co-chaperones that associate with Hsp90 and play their own roles in aging and neurodegeneration  As these Hsp90 co-chaperones change with age they can significantly impact the propensity for certain neurodegenerative diseases. FKBP51 steadily increases with age and both FKBP51 and Aha1 are induced in the AD brain suggesting that these two co-chaperones negatively affect tau pathology. On the other hand, both CyP40 and PP5 are repressed in aged and AD brains. CyP40 disaggregates tau fibrils in vitro and PP5 dephosphorylates tau restoring microtubule binding, suggesting that increasing the levels or activity of these co-chaperones could have a beneficial, neuroprotective role in diseases such as AD. These are just a few examples of how important maintaining the balance of Hsp90 co-chaperones is to homeostasis, and what can happen when they are altered in aging and disease. Hsp90 co-chaperones offer a unique target for potential therapeutics due to their specific roles within the Hsp90 machinery. Overall, more work needs to be done to develop BBB-permeable therapeutics to target discrete Hsp90 co-chaperones for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies. LS wrote the manuscript. JK created the figures and edited the manuscript. LB critiqued and edited the manuscript drafts. The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. The ATP-dependent 90 kDa heat shock protein, Hsp90, is a major regulator of protein triage, from assisting in nascent protein folding to refolding or degrading aberrant proteins. Tau, a microtubule associated protein, aberrantly accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, deemed tauopathies. Hsp90 binds to and regulates tau fate in coordination with a diverse group of co-chaperones. Imbalances in chaperone levels and activity, as found in the aging brain, can contribute to disease onset and progression. For example, the levels of the Hsp90 co-chaperone, FK506-binding protein 51 kDa (FKBP51), progressively increase with age. In vitro and in vivo tau models demonstrated that FKBP51 synergizes with Hsp90 to increase neurotoxic tau oligomer production. Inversely, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which dephosphorylates tau to restore microtubule-binding function, is repressed with aging and activity is further repressed in AD. Similarly, levels of cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) are reduced in the aged brain and further repressed in AD. Interestingly, CyP40 was shown to breakup tau aggregates in vitro and prevent tau-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. Moreover, the only known stimulator of Hsp90 ATPase activity, Aha1, increases tau aggregation and toxicity. While the levels of Aha1 are not significantly altered with aging, increased levels have been found in AD brains. Overall, these changes in the Hsp90 heterocomplex could drive tau deposition and neurotoxicity. While the relationship of tau and Hsp90 in coordination with these co-chaperones is still under investigation, it is clear that imbalances in these proteins with aging can contribute to disease onset and progression. This review highlights the current understanding of how the Hsp90 family of molecular chaperones regulates tau or other misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases with a particular emphasis on the impact of aging. ."
PMC4608380_0,"Tau pathology is known to spread in a hierarchical pattern in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain during disease progression, likely by trans-synaptic tau transfer between neurons. However, the tau species involved in inter-neuron propagation remains unclear. To identify tau species responsible for propagation, we examined uptake and propagation properties of different tau species derived from postmortem cortical extracts and brain interstitial fluid of tau-transgenic mice, as well as human AD cortices. Here we show that PBS-soluble phosphorylated high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau, though very low in abundance, is taken up, axonally transported, and passed on to synaptically connected neurons. Our findings suggest that a rare species of soluble phosphorylated HMW tau is the endogenous form of tau involved in propagation and could be a target for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development. In Alzheimer's disease, tau spreads throughout the brain, however the nature of the tau species propagating from one neuron to another is not known. Here, Takeda et al. identify a rare, high-molecular-weight tau as the primary species taken up and transferred between synaptically connected neurons.

The authors declare no competing financial interests. Accumulation and aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau<1>, as intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD)<2><3>. Cognitive deficits in AD are most closely linked with progression of NFTs in a hierarchical pattern, starting in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and marching throughout the brain during disease progression<4><5>. Although the precise mechanisms for this characteristic tau pathology spread remain unknown, accumulating evidence suggests a trans-synaptic transfer of tau proteins between neurons<6><7><8>. By developing the rTgTauEC mouse model of early AD that overexpresses human mutant P301L tau selectively in the EC, we and other groups have demonstrated that aggregated tau accumulates in synaptically connected downstream areas such as dentate gyrus, suggesting that NFT propagation occurs by cross-synaptic spread of pathologically misfolded tau proteins<9><10><11><12>. Other studies demonstrated that pathological forms of tau replicate conformation and spread among cells, thus suggesting that prion-like mechanisms underlie the stereotyped propagation of tau<13><14><15><16>. It has been shown that tau can be secreted from intact neurons into the extracellular space in an activity-dependent manner<17><18>, supporting the idea that extracellular misfolded tau that is taken up by neurons may provide a platform for tau pathology spreading. Better understanding of the molecular basis of tau propagation is key to preventing progression from early mild memory impairment to full cognitive deterioration and dementia.Recent studies showed that cellular tau uptake and trans-cellular propagation occur in various systems in vitro and in vivo; however, whether the tau species involved in neuron-to-neuron transfer is fibrillar or not, and what its specific properties are, remains uncertain. In this study, to identify the specific tau species responsible for propagation, we compared the uptake and propagation properties of different tau species derived from brain extracts of tau-transgenic mouse lines rTg4510 (expressing aggregating P301L tau (0N4R))<19> and rTg21221 (expressing non-aggregating wild-type (WT) human tau (0N4R))<20>, human sporadic AD brain extracts, and recombinant WT full-length human tau (2N4R, 441 amino acid (aa)). We isolated the propagating tau species via differential centrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), characterized it biochemically, and then studied its neuronal uptake in mouse primary cortical neurons and in vivo. For all different sources of tau, efficient uptake was only observed for high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau species.We then examined the transfer of tau between neurons using a newly developed microfluidic neuron culture platform, which comprises three distinct chambers that are connected through arrays of thin channels such that the axon growth and formation of synaptic connections are precisely controlled between neurons in different chambers. Furthermore, a unique large-pore (1,000 kDa cutoff) probe in vivo microdialysis<21><22> allowed us to investigate the presence of HMW tau species in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of awake, freely moving mice. Our findings suggest that PBS-soluble phosphorylated HMW tau species, present in the brain extracellular space, are involved in neuronal uptake and propagation. Identification and characterization of tau species taken up by neurons is critical for understanding the mechanism of neuron-to-neuron tau propagation. We first examined the molecular weight of tau species involved in neuronal uptake. We prepared PBS-soluble brain extracts from rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant P301L tau, by centrifugation either at 3,000, 10,000, 50,000 or 150,000g, and applied the supernatant to mouse primary cortical neurons. The uptake of tau was assessed by immunofluorescence labelling of intracellular human tau. After 24 h, human tau uptake was observed in neurons treated with 3,000 and 10,000g brain extracts, which presumably contained HMW proteins. No uptake occurred from 50,000 and 150,000g extracts (<Fig. 1a>) from which HMW tau was depleted by sedimentation. In neurons treated for longer incubation periods, robust tau uptake was observed from 3,000g extract after 2 and 5 days, however, little uptake occurred from 150,000g extract even after 5 days of incubation (<Fig. 1b>). We also confirmed cellular tau uptake from the 3,000g extract using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based HEK-tau-biosensor cells<23> (<Fig. 1c>). The 3,000g brain extracts showed significantly higher seeding activity than 150,000g extracts (<Supplementary Fig. 1>). The seeding activity of 150,000g extracts eventually (within 24 h) caught up with that of 3,000g extracts (<Supplementary Fig. 1b>), suggesting that uptake is the key element in the kinetics of tau uptake and aggregation processes.We then assessed the molecular weight size distribution of tau species contained in each brain extract by SEC. The 3,000g brain extract had a small peak of HMW tau species (SEC Frc. 2–4) in addition to a dominant low molecular weight (LMW) tau peak (SEC Frc. 13–16, 50–150 kDa), while the 150,000g brain extract from the same rTg4510 mouse brain had only a LMW tau peak and a trace amount of HMW tau species (<Fig. 1d,e>). The involvement of HMW tau species in neuronal uptake was confirmed by incubating each SEC fraction with primary neurons (<Fig. 1f>). The most extensive tau uptake was observed for HMW fractions (Frc. 2, 3). Essentially no detectable uptake was observed from the dramatically more abundant LMW fractions, suggesting that HMW tau species were the forms being taken up. Tau uptake assay in HEK-tau-biosensor cells also demonstrated that HMW tau can be taken up by cells more efficiently than LMW tau species (<Fig. 1g>).Exposure to 8 M urea reduced the immunoreactivity of the tau oligomer-specific antibody (T22) in the 3,000g brain extract (dot blot, <Supplementary Fig. 2a,b>), and the HMW smear of tau in the HMW SEC fraction largely disappeared after urea incubation (SDS-PAGE, <Supplementary Fig. 2c>), suggesting the existence of a multimeric tau assembly in this fraction. To further characterize HMW tau, we immunoprecipitated tau from HMW SEC fraction and characterized it by atomic force microscopy (AFM; <Fig. 1h>)."
PMC4608380_1,"HMW SEC fraction (Frc  3) contained small globular but no fibrillar tau aggregates (<Fig. 1h>). The size (particle height) distribution revealed particles of 12.1±1.5 (h1) and 16.8±4.1 (h2) nm (height±s.d., n=1,206; <Fig. 1h>). It remains open if these tau containing particles are made exclusively of tau or contain other constituents such as proteins and lipids.Human tau species observed within primary neurons 2–5 days after exposure to rTg4510 brain extract were Alz50 positive (<Fig. 1i>, top) but negative for Thioflavin-S (ThioS) staining (<Fig. 1i>, bottom), indicating an early stage of pathological conformation of tau that is taken up. Furthermore, tau species taken up by primary neurons co-localized with subcellular organelle markers such as the Golgi apparatus and the lysosomes at day 3 (<Supplementary Fig. 3>).Uptake of human tau occurred in a concentration-dependent manner (<Supplementary Fig. 4>). Applying different human tau concentrations, we found that the minimum concentration of HMW tau from rTg4510 brain extract required for detection of neuronal uptake was 10 ng ml−1 (<Supplementary Fig. 4>), which is lower than the ISF levels of tau in tau-transgenic mice (∼250 ng ml−1 (ref. <24>)). Tau uptake in primary neurons occurred in both the presence and absence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-labelled astrocytes (<Supplementary Fig. 5a>).Importantly, neuronal uptake of HMW tau occurred in vivo as well; human tau uptake in neurons was detected in young rTg4510 (pre-tangle stage) (<Fig. 1j–l>) and WT (<Supplementary Fig. 6>) mice injected with the HMW SEC fraction of Tg4510 (12 months) brain extract, but not in those injected with the LMW fractions. To evaluate the relevance of tau aggregation and phosphorylation for neuronal uptake, we prepared 3,000g brain extracts from rTg21221 mice and compared the uptake and biochemical properties with those of rTg4510 homogenate. rTg21221 mice overexpress WT human tau under the same promoter as rTg4510 mice and show phosphorylation but no accumulation of misfolded and aggregated tau species in the brain<20>. Unlike the case for the rTg4510 mice, no uptake was observed in primary neurons from rTg21221 brain extracts at day 2 (<Fig. 2a>, top). Tau uptake assay in HEK-tau-biosensor cells also demonstrated lack of tau uptake from rTg21221 brain extracts (<Fig. 2a>, bottom). Human tau and total tau levels in PBS-soluble brain extracts were comparable to those seen in rTg4510 brains (<Fig. 2b,c>), although an upward shift of the tau band in western blot (<Fig. 2c>, arrow) suggested a higher degree of tau phosphorylation in rTg4510 brain.We next compared the degree of tau phosphorylation in rTg4510 and rTg21221 extracts in more detail using 10 different phospho-tau epitope-specific antibodies (<Fig. 2d>). The PBS-extractable tau species from rTg4510 brain had higher levels of phosphorylation compared with the tau species obtained from rTg21221, especially those associated with some specific phosphorylation sites such as pT205, pS262, pS400, pS404, pS409 and pS422. SEC analysis of the molecular weight distribution of tau demonstrated that rTg21221 brain extracts (PBS-soluble, 3,000g) contained primarily LMW species and very low levels of HMW tau species, whereas rTg4510 brain extract showed both HMW and LMW peaks (<Fig. 2e,f>). The degree of tau uptake into primary neurons correlated significantly with HMW (SEC Frc. 2–4, >669 kDa) tau levels, but not with middle molecular weight (SEC Frc. 9–10, 200–300 kDa) or LMW (SEC Frc. 13–16, 50–150 kDa) tau levels (<Supplementary Fig. 7>). The differences in HMW tau levels between rTg4510 and rTg21221 brain extracts were also confirmed by western blot (SDS-PAGE) analysis of SEC fractions (<Fig. 2g>) and semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) blot (<Supplementary Fig. 8>); HMW tau from rTg4510 brain was highly phosphorylated (<Fig. 2g>, PHF1). Dot blot analysis demonstrated the presence of oligomeric form of tau in PBS-soluble extracts from rTg4510 brain, although those from rTg21221 brain only had a small amount of tau oligomer assessed with antibody T22 (<Fig. 2h>). These findings suggest that phosphorylated HMW tau species are taken up by neurons. We then studied the transfer of tau between neurons using a microfluidic neuron culture platform. The design of this platform includes three distinct chambers forming layering synaptic connections between neurons, which are plated on different chambers and arrays of microgrooves, allowing an exclusive axon growth by sizes (<Fig. 3a>). Two sets of neurons are plated into the 1st and 2nd chambers (<Fig. 3a>). The axons from the 1st chamber neurons extend into the 2nd chamber within 4 days (<Fig. 3b>, left), and axons from the 2nd chamber neurons extend to the 3rd chamber (<Fig. 3b>, middle). The resulting two sets of neurons therefore have ‘in line' synaptic connections at the 2nd chamber (<Fig. 3b>, right). We labelled the 1st chamber neurons with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the 2nd chamber neurons with red fluorescent protein (RFP) using a hydrostatic pressure barrier to fluidically isolate neurons in different chambers<25>. This confirmed that the two neuronal populations were connected to each other in the 2nd chamber (<Fig. 3c>). We assessed the propagation properties of rTg4510 brain-derived tau species using the three-chamber microfluidic neuron chamber. PBS-soluble brain extracts from an rTg4510 mouse (3,000g, 500 ng ml−1 human tau) were added to the 1st chamber (<Fig. 4a>). To assure that only the 1st chamber neurons were exposed to brain extract, the diffusion-driven transport of various tau species was blocked by convective flow in the opposite direction (hydrostatic pressure barrier). After 5 days of incubation, a human tau-specific immunostain revealed positive immunoreactivity in neurons and in axons of the neurons from the 1st chamber, as well as the soma of the neurons in the 2nd chamber (<Fig. 4b>), indicating that human tau species taken up by the 1st chamber neurons had been transported through their axons and transferred into the 2nd chamber neurons. Neurons that establish little or no axon-dendrite connection with the 1st chamber neurons (in the side reservoir of the 2nd chamber) remained negative for human tau staining (<Fig. 4b>, bottom), supporting the idea that axonal input from the 1st chamber is necessary for tau transfer. Human tau was also detected in axons and dendrites extending from the human tau positive 2nd chamber neurons (<Fig. 4c>), implicating further transport of tau species into the 3rd chamber. Retrograde propagation from the 2nd to the 1st chamber also occurred during the same time course of the experiment (<Supplementary Fig. 9>), which is consistent with previous research in vitro<26> and in vivo<13><15>.The propagation of tau in the microfluidic device was concentration dependent and 500–600 ng ml−1 of human tau (in the 1st chamber) was needed to detect propagation to the 2nd chamber neurons over the course of a few days (<Fig. 4d,e>). Importantly, these concentrations are similar to the ISF tau levels in tau-transgenic mice<24>. Time-course analysis showed early uptake of human tau in the 1st chamber neurons (as early as day 1), propagation to the 2nd chamber neurons after 5 days, and progression to the 2nd chamber neuron axon terminals in the 3rd chamber after 8 days (<Fig. 4e>). There was no detectable astrocyte contamination in the 2nd chamber of the microfluidic device (<Supplementary Fig. 5b>), indicating that neuron-to-neuron tau transfer can occur in the absence of astrocytes. To assess the lifetime of tau in primary neurons after uptake, brain extract from rTg4510 (PBS-3,000g, 500 ng ml−1 human tau) was added into the 1st chamber of the microfluidic device and excess tau was removed before (at day 2, <Fig. 4e>) or after (at day 5, <Fig. 4e>) tau had propagated to the 2nd chamber neurons, and neurons were further cultured for 6 (day 2–8) or 9 (day 5–14) days, respectively (<Fig. 5a>)."
PMC4608380_2,"Interestingly, human tau positive neurons in the 2nd chamber were detected even after removal of brain extract from the 1st chamber before propagation (at day 8, 6 days after excess tau removal; <Fig  5b>). Similarly, human tau positive axons were observed in the 3rd chamber at day 8 (3 days after removal of brain extract from the 1st chamber) (<Fig. 5c>). These findings indicate that once a certain amount of tau was taken up by the neurons, tau could propagate to the next neuron even after removal of extracellular tau species. Tau species taken up by the 1st chamber neurons or propagated to the 2nd chamber neurons could be detected for up to 6 days (day 2–8, <Fig. 5b>) or 9 days (day 5–14, <Fig. 5c>) after washing out the human tau from the medium, indicating a slow degradation of HMW tau species in cultured neurons. We next examined uptake and propagation properties of tau species derived from human AD and control brain tissues. Like rTg4510 brain extract, the PBS-soluble extract from human AD brain contained tau species that could be taken up by mouse primary neurons (<Fig. 6a>). These tau species again were found only in the 3,000g extract (<Fig. 6a,b>). No uptake was observed from human control brain extracts (<Fig. 6a,b>). Cellular uptake of AD brain-derived tau (3,000g extract) was also confirmed in HEK-tau-biosensor cells (<Fig. 6c>). The 3,000g extracts from AD brain had higher seeding activity than those from control brain (<Fig. 6d>). The tau species taken up by neurons co-localized with markers for the Golgi apparatus and the lysosomes (<Fig. 6e>), verifying the internalization and intracellular processing of tau. The tau species from AD brain extracts also propagated between neurons in the three-chamber microfluidic device within 7 days (<Fig. 6f>).Total tau levels in PBS-soluble extracts from AD and control brains were similar (<Fig. 6g>). However, the AD brain extract (3,000g) contained significantly higher levels of phosphorylated tau (<Fig. 6h,i,m>) when compared with the control brain, especially those associated with some specific phosphorylation sites such as pS199, pS396 and pS404 (<Fig. 6i>). Interestingly, both AD and control brain extracts (PBS-3,000g) had comparable total amounts of HMW tau species on SEC analysis (<Fig. 6j,k>), despite the clear difference in cellular uptake of tau from the AD and control extracts (<Fig. 6a–c>). The involvement of AD brain-derived HMW tau species in neuronal uptake was confirmed by incubating each SEC fraction with primary neurons (<Fig. 6l>). Little uptake of the lower molecular weight fractions occurred, even when tau was supplied at 100 times higher concentrations (5 versus 500 ng ml−1 human tau in the medium).We then measured phosphorylation levels of tau in each SEC fraction. The HMW tau species from the AD brain were highly phosphorylated compared with those from control brain (<Fig. 6m>). Notably, most of the highly phosphorylated tau species from PBS-soluble AD brain extract were detected in the HMW fractions (<Fig. 6m>). These findings confirmed the presence of phosphorylated HMW tau species in PBS-soluble extracts from AD brain tissue and suggested that these phosphorylated forms may be the forms taken up and propagated by neurons. We tested the idea that tau phosphorylation or, simply, size of tau, was important for cellular uptake by preparing a monomer-dimer-oligomer tau mixture from recombinant human WT full-length tau (441 aa), separated by SEC (<Fig. 7a>). We then incubated each SEC fraction of this non-phosphorylated tau mixture (<Fig. 7b>) with mouse primary neurons. No uptake was observed in primary neurons even from HMW tau fractions (<Fig. 7c>).We next studied the effect of dephosphorylation of tau on cellular uptake. Phosphatase treatment dephosphorylated tau in rTg4510 brain extract (<Fig. 7d>) without changing HMW tau levels (<Fig. 7e>), resulting in a significant reduction of cellular uptake of tau (<Fig. 7f>). We then assessed tau uptake from phospho-tau-immunodepleted rTg4510 brain extract in primary neurons. Phospho-tau specific antibodies were less efficient at immunodepletion than the total tau antibody (HT7) (<Fig. 7g>); however, some phospho-tau antibodies (pS199, pT205 and pS396) more efficiently reduced the neuronal tau uptake (<Fig. 7h–j>) than the total tau antibody, suggesting that they specifically interacted with a species of tau important for uptake. Taken together, these observations indicate that phosphorylation enhances neuronal uptake. It is known that soluble tau species exist in the cerebrospinal fluid and the ISF in the brain<24>, although limitations of the microdialysis probes used to date would have precluded observation of the critical HMW species described here in the postmortem brain. We therefore employed a unique large pore (1,000 kDa cutoff) probe microdialysis technique with push–pull perfusion system that allows consistent collection of HMW molecules from the brain ISF of awake, freely moving mice<21><22> (<Fig. 8a,b>). SEC fractionation followed by human tau-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that brain ISF from rTg4510 mouse contained HMW tau species in addition to LMW tau (<Fig. 8c>). ISF tau from rTg4510 mice was taken up by primary neurons after 3 days of incubation (<Fig. 8d>), with 40 ng ml−1 total human tau being sufficient to detect tau uptake (<Fig. 8e>). The distribution of tau appeared to be more diffuse in soma compared with tau taken up from brain extracts, which might be due to the relatively low tau levels in ISF or a different size distribution pattern (<Fig. 8c>). These data show that secreted tau, present in the ISF of awake behaving animals, can be taken up by neurons and therefore might account for the propagation of tau across neural systems observed in transgenic models. To assess the effect of extracellular tau uptake on cell viability, we performed a cell death assay using ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) staining in HEK-tau-biosensor cells. There was no difference in cell viability between tau-aggregate positive and negative cells for up to 4 days (<Supplementary Fig. 10>). In addition, we assessed the effect of HMW tau species on neuronal viability using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. No acute toxicity was observed in mouse primary neurons treated with HMW tau at 48 h (<Supplementary Fig. 11>). These results imply that cellular tau uptake and subsequent intracellular aggregation do not cause acute cell death. Identifying the tau species that can be transferred between neurons is essential for understanding mechanisms by which misfolded tau propagates in AD and other tauopathies. Here we characterized the uptake and propagation properties of tau from various sources: brain extracts and ISF from tau-transgenic mice, brain extracts from postmortem AD patients and recombinant human tau protein. We found that a rare HMW tau species, which accounts for only a small fraction (estimated at <1%) of all soluble tau species in the AD samples, was robustly taken up by neurons, whereas uptake of LMW tau was very inefficient. Findings from the microfluidic neuron culture platform confirmed that this rare species is uniquely capable of propagating between neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tau with similar biochemical characteristics can be identified in the brain ISF of rTg4510 animals obtained while they were awake and behaving, raising the possibility that it is a normal product in the brain. This ISF can also donate tau that can be taken up by neurons in culture. Together, these data imply that (i) a relatively rare, HMW, phosphorylated tau species is released from neurons and found in brain ISF; and (ii) this species can be taken up, axonally transported, secreted and taken up by synaptically connected neurons and thus ‘propagated'.Uptake of tau from mice expressing aggregating P301L tau (rTg4510) depended on tau molecular weight, correlated with the level of phosphorylation. These findings suggest that oligomerization and pathological phosphorylation increased the uptake efficiency of tau."
PMC4608380_3,"The HMW tau species had a pathologically misfolded conformation (positive for Alz50 antibody staining) and appeared as non-fibrillar structures in AFM  Previous studies reported that synthetic tau fibrils<26><27><28><29> or fibrillar tau species extracted from tau-transgenic mouse brain<14><15> could be taken up by neurons and induce filamentous tau pathology in vitro and in vivo. Our observations indicate instead that soluble, misfolded HMW tau present in the extracellular space likely plays a role in propagation. Preliminary data using extracts from a human G389R tau mutation case with frontotemporal dementia that did not have filamentous tau inclusions nonetheless showed tau uptake into neurons from a PBS-soluble extract, thus supporting the conclusion that soluble tau rather than filamentous aggregates support the propagation phenomenon described here.Our findings do not entirely exclude the involvement of LMW tau species in uptake and propagation. It may well be possible that the concentration of tau used in this study (500 ng ml−1 human tau) was too low for uptake of LMW tau species, or that immunostaining was not sensitive enough to detect LMW tau internalized by neurons. Michel et al.<30> demonstrated that extracellular monomeric tau enters SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at concentration as high as 1 μM (∼55 μg ml−1). Notably, consistent with our findings, the same study showed that tau aggregates can be released and then internalized by other cells.The intracellular accumulation of insoluble tau aggregates has long been considered to be toxic to neurons<31>; however, a recent study reported that insoluble tau aggregates are not sufficient to impair neuronal function<32>. Our findings from the cell viability assay (<Supplementary Figs 10 and 11>) imply that tau uptake and subsequent intracellular aggregation do not cause acute cell death. Further work will be needed to explore the long-term effect of extracellular and taken-up HMW tau on neuronal function.Spread of tau pathological lesions from medial temporal lobe towards temporal and other neocortical regions correlates well with the extent of cognitive impairment<5>, and the number of tangles appears to increase in each brain area with increasing duration of disease<3><33>. If one mechanism for this spread is trans-synaptic propagation of misfolded tau species, as has been postulated, then understanding the parameters that govern this process is of importance in designing effective strategies to slow progression of cognitive changes in AD. Extracellular tau propagation can be divided into uptake, axonal transport, release and re-uptake phases, with pathobiological processes leading to enhanced or diminished rates at each step. Our data suggest that uptake of unmodified LMW tau at physiological concentrations is not detected during the time course of our experiments, whereas uptake of a relatively rare HMW phosphorylated species is very efficient, occurring within 24 h of exposure. Even in vivo, injection of the HMW tau, as opposed to the much more abundant LMW tau species, leads to uptake into neurons both in WT (<Supplementary Fig. 6>) and pre-tangle stage rTg4510 (<Fig. 1j–l>) mouse brains. Three lines of data support the idea that phosphorylation is important: uptake efficiency correlates with extent of phosphorylation (<Figs 2> and <6>); enzymatically dephosphorylating the tau blocks uptake (<Fig. 7d–f>); and some phospho-tau specific antibodies are able to block uptake despite being relatively ineffective in IPing tau from the rTg4510 brain extract (<Fig. 7g–j>). In addition, recombinant non-phosphorylated tau, even when prepared as a HMW oligomer, is not taken up efficiently by neurons (<Fig. 7a–c>).The HMW tau appears to be quite stable once it is taken up, as it is detectable days after it is washed off (<Fig. 5>), which might be due to the hyperphosphorylation state of this species<34><35>. It undergoes axonal transport, is released, and can be taken up by the next neuron. Thus after initial uptake, at least in these model systems, axonal transport, release into a synapse and trans-synaptic propagation seem to occur relatively rapidly. If these data are applicable to human AD, the implication is that formation, release and uptake of the HMW phosphorylated forms of tau are key factors in determining propagation of tau across neural systems. The amount of HMW phospho-tau species accounted for <1% of the total PBS-soluble tau in AD brain extracts, and <10% even in mutant-tau overexpressing rTg4510 mouse brain extracts, in contrast to the much more abundant LMW tau species. These data suggest that targeting HMW tau species may be an effective way of blocking or slowing the tau propagation cascade in AD. Intervention to deplete these specific extracellular tau species might inhibit tau propagation and hence disease progression in tauopathies. Eleven- to thirteen-month-old rTg4510, rTg21221 and control animals were used. The rTg4510 (P301L tau) mouse is a well-characterized model of tauopathy, which overexpresses full-length human four-repeat tau (0N4R) with the P301L frontotemporal dementia mutation<19>. The rTg21221 mouse expresses WTT human tau at levels comparable to rTg4510 mouse and does not show accumulation of tau pathology in the brain<20>. Littermate animals with only the activator CK-tTA transgene, which do not overexpress tau, were used as controls. Both male and female mice were used. All experiments were performed under national (United States National Institutes of Health) and institutional (Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee for Research Animal Care and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Harvard Medical School) guidelines. All animal experiments were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital and McLaughlin Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Frozen brain tissues from the frontal cortex of four patients with AD, three non-demented control subjects were obtained from the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Brain Bank. The demographic characteristics of the subjects are shown in <Supplementary Table 1>. All the study subjects or their next of kin gave informed consent for the brain donation, and the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol. All the AD subjects fulfilled the NIA-Reagan criteria for high likelihood of AD. Cortical grey matter was weighed and processed as described in the following section (Brain extraction). Mice were perfused with cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Roche, USA), and the brain was rapidly excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C before use. Brain tissue was homogenized in five volumes (wt/vol) of cold PBS using a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was briefly sonicated (Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 100, output 2, 6 × 1 s) and centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min at 4 °C (3,000g extract), 10,000g for 15 min at 4 °C (10,000g extract), 50,000g for 30 min at 4 °C (50,000g extract) or 150,000g for 30 min at 4 °C (150,000g extract). The supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C before use. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from cerebral cortices of embryonic day (E) 14–15 CD1 mouse embryos (Charles River Laboratories) as described previously<36> with modifications. Cortices were dissected out and mechanically dissociated in Neurobasal (Life Technologies, Inc., USA) medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM Glutamax, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 g ml−1 streptomycin (plating medium), centrifuged at 150 g for 5 min and resuspended in the same medium. Neurons were plated at a density of 0.6 × 105 viable cells on a Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc) or microfluidic devices (see below for cell density and protocol) previously coated with poly-D-lysine (50 μg ml−1, Sigma) overnight. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Neurobasal medium with 2% (vol/vol) B27 nutrient, 2 mM Glutamax, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 g ml−1 streptomycin (culture medium)."
PMC4608380_4,"Mouse primary neurons (7–8 days in vitro) were incubated with PBS-soluble brain extracts (3,000, 10,000, 50,000 or 150,000g centrifugation supernatant, or SEC fractions from 3,000g extract) from mouse (rTg4510 or rTg21221 animals) or human (control or sporadic AD) brain tissues, microdialysate from rTg4510/control mice, or recombinant tau oligomer mixture solution  Neurons were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Each sample was diluted with culture medium to obtain the designated human tau concentrations (measured by human tau ELISA). Neurons were washed extensively with PBS, fixed and immunostained with human tau-specific antibody (Tau13, #MMS-520R, Covance, 1:2,000) to detect exogenously applied human tau in mouse primary neurons at the designated time point. For most experiments described in this study, we used total (human and mouse) tau antibody (#A0024, DAKO, 1:1,000) as a neuronal marker. Each sample was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter to remove large aggregates and fibrils before incubation. Stably expressing CFP-/YFP-TauRD(P301S) HEK293 cells (Holmes et al.<23>) were plated at 30,000 cells per well in a 96-well PDL-coated plate. The following day, PBS-soluble brain extracts (3,000g) were applied at designated concentrations of human tau or total proteins in a total of 40 μl Opti-MEM (#11058-021, Life technologies) with (for tau seeding assay) or without (for tau uptake assay) Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (#11668019, Life technologies). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at designated time points after the extracts were applied and confocal images were obtained via FRET channel (excited with a 458-nm laser and fluorescence was captured with 500–550 nm filter). FRET density, defined as the number of FRET-positive tau aggregates multiplied by the mean fluorescence intensity of FRET-positive tau aggregates and then normalized by the number of cells (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining), was used for quantification analysis. Each condition was performed at least in triplicate. Stereotactic injections of brain extract were performed as described previously with minor modifications<37>. WT mice (male, 3-months-old, male, C57BL6/J) were injected by using a 30-gauge Hamilton microsyringe in the left frontal cortex (bregma +1.3 mm, 1.5 mm lateral to midline, −1.6 mm relative to bregma) at an infusion rate of 0.2 μl min−1. HMW (2.5 μl) (Frc. 2–3) or LMW (Frc. 13–14) SEC fractions (100 or 500 ng ml−1 human tau) from rTg4510 brain extract (male, 12-months-old, PBS-soluble, 3,000g) were injected. The same volume of PBS was injected as a negative control. Mice were killed 48 h after injection and brain sections from frontal cortex were immunostained with human tau-specific antibody (Tau13, #MMS-520R, Covance, 1:2,000), chicken polyclonal anti-NeuN antibody (#ab134014, Abcam, 1:500), and counterstained with DAPI. Anti-mouse Alexa488 (1:1,000) and CY3-labelled anti-chicken IgG (1:1,000) secondary antibodies were used to detect human tau and NeuN, respectively (see also Immunostaining of brain sections). Images were acquired on an AxioImager Z1 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were semi-quantitatively evaluated for human tau staining by a rater who was blinded to the experimental conditions, using a score from 0 (no human tau labelling on NeuN positive neurons) to 4 (maximum human tau labelling on NeuN positive neurons). Hippocampal injections of brain extract were performed as described previously with minor modifications<13>. rTg4510 mice (male, 2–3-months-old, pre-tangle stage) were injected by using a 30-gauge Hamilton microsyringe in the left hippocampus (bregma −2.5 mm, 2.0 mm lateral to midline, −1.8 mm relative to bregma) at an infusion rate of 0.2 μl min−1. HMW (2.5 μl) (Frc. 2–3) or LMW (Frc. 13–14) SEC fractions (100 ng ml−1 human tau) from rTg4510 brain extract (male, 12-months-old, PBS-soluble, 3,000g) were injected. The same volume of PBS was injected as a negative control. Mice were killed three weeks after injection and serial coronal brain sections (40 μm) were taken though the entire brain. Sections were incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature (R.T.), blocked in 3% milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) with 0.25% Triton X-100, and incubated with biotinylated AT8 antibody (ThermoScientific, MN1020B, 1:1,000) in 3% milk in TBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TBS, sections were developed with nickel-enhanced DAB substrate using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). Every seventh section was stained. Images were obtained using an Olympus BX51 microscope mounted with a DP 70 Olympus digital camera. The number of AT8-positive neurons was manually counted by a blinded investigator (seven sections for each mouse). Immunoprecipitation isolation of tau from rTg4510 brain extract for AFM analysis was performed as described previously with minor modifications<38>. Briefly, tosylactivated magnetic Dynabeads (#14203, Life Technologies) were coated with human tau-specific Tau13 antibody. Beads were washed (0.2 M Tris, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.5) and incubated with HMW SEC fraction (Frc. 3 from 10,000g extract, rTg4510) sample for 1 h at R.T. Beads were washed three times with PBS and eluted using 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.8, and the pH of each eluted fraction was immediately adjusted using 1 M Tris pH 8.0. For AFM imaging, isolated tau fractions were adsorbed onto freshly cleaved muscovite mica and imaged using oscillation mode AFM (Nanoscope III, Di-Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) and Si3N4 cantilevers (NPS series, Di-Veeco) in PBS, as described previously<39>. For size (AFM heights) distribution histogram of HMW tau oligomers (SEC Frc. 3), 1,206 particles from seven randomly picked images (1.5 × 1.5 μm) were analysed (<Fig. 1h>). In vivo microdialysis sampling of brain ISF tau was performed as described previously<21><22>. The microdialysis probe had a 4 mm shaft with a 3.0 mm, 1,000 kDa molecular weight cutoff polyethylene membrane (PEP-4-03, Eicom, Japan). This probe contains a ventilation hole near the top which serves to produce a reservoir of fluid within the probe that is open to the atmosphere. This structure minimizes pressure which would otherwise cause a net flow of perfusate out through the large-pore membrane. Before use, the probe was conditioned by briefly dipping it in ethanol, and then washed with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion buffer (in mm: 122 NaCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 3.0 KH2PO4 and 25.0 NaHCO3) that was filtered through a 0.2 μm pore-size membrane. The preconditioned probe's outlet and inlet were connected to a peristaltic pump (ERP-10, Eicom) and a microsyringe pump (ESP-32, Eicom), respectively, using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing (ϕ 250 μm inner diameter).Probe implantation was performed as previously described<21>, with slight modifications. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, while a guide cannula (PEG-4, Eicom) was stereotactically implanted in the hippocampus (bregma −3.1 mm, −2.5 mm lateral to midline, −1.0 mm ventral to dura).Three or four days after the implantation of the guide cannula, the mice were placed in a standard microdialysis cage and a probe was inserted through the guide. After insertion of the probe, to obtain stable recordings, the probe and connecting tubes were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 180 min at a flow rate of 10 μl min−1 before sample collection. Samples were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 μl min−1. The concentrations of human tau in the samples (brain extracts, brain ISF samples, and recombinant human tau solution, and SEC-separated samples) were determined by Tau (total) Human ELISA kit (#KHB0041, Life Technologies) and Tau [pS396] Human ELISA kit (#KHB7031, Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brain extracts were electrophoresed on Novex Tris-Glycine gels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) in Tris-Glycine SDS running buffer for SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies)."
PMC4608380_5,"Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes, and membranes were blocked for 60 min at R T. in 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA)/TBS-Tween (TBS-T), and then probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in 2% (wt/vol) BSA/TBS-T. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibody DA9 (total tau (aa112–129), courtesy of Peter Davies, 1:5,000), mouse monoclonal antibody PHF1 (pS396/pS404 tau, courtesy of Peter Davies, 1:5,000), mouse monoclonal antibody CP13 (pS202 tau, courtesy of Peter Davies, 1:1,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho tau antibodies (pS199 (#44734G), pT205 (#44738G), pS262 (#44750G), pS396 (#44752), pS400 (#44754G), pS404 (#44758G), pS409 (#44760G) and pS422 (#44764G)) from Life Technologies (1:2,000 dilution for these antibodies), and mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (#A4700, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2,500). After washing three times in PBS-T, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (#172-1011, Bio-Rad) or anti-rabbit (#172-1019, Bio-Rad) IgG secondary antibodies (1:2,000 dilution) for 1 h at R.T. Immunoreactive proteins were developed using an ECL kit (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer, USA) and detected on Hyperfilm ECL (GE healthcare, USA). Protein/lane (15 μg) were loaded, unless indicated otherwise. Scanned images were analysed using Image J (National Institutes of Health). Full length versions of western blots are shown in <Supplementary Fig. 12>. For dot blot, brain extracts (0.75 μg protein in 1.5 μl) were spotted directly onto nitrocellulose membranes (#88018, Thermo Scientific). Membranes were blocked for 60 min at R.T. in 5% (wt/vol) BSA/TBS-T, and then probed with primary antibodies for 60 min at R.T. in 2% (wt/vol) BSA/TBS-T. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal tau oligomer-specific antibody T22 (#ABN454, Millipore, 1:1,000)<40>, mouse monoclonal antibody Tau13 (#MMS-520R, Covance, 1:2,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-total tau antibody (#ab64193, Abcam, 1:1,000). After washing three times in PBS-T, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (#172-1011, Bio-Rad) or anti-rabbit (#172-1019, Bio-Rad) IgG secondary antibodies (1:2,000 dilution) for 60 min at R.T. Immunoreactive proteins were developed using an ECL kit (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer, USA) and detected on Hyperfilm ECL (GE healthcare, USA). The rTg4510 brain extracts (12-months-old, PBS-3,000g) were incubated with 8 M urea or 10% SDS (1.0 μg μl−1 total protein in 8 M urea or 10% SDS) for 24 h at 37 °C before application to the membrane for dot blot analysis. The SEC HMW fractions (Frc. 2) from the rTg4510 brain extracts (12-months-old, PBS-3,000g) were incubated with 8 M urea for 24 h at 37 °C and analysed by SDS-PAGE (non-reducing condition) using total tau antibody (#A0024, DAKO, 1:1,000). SDD-AGE was carried out as previously described<13> with minor modifications. Brain extract was thawed on ice. A 1.5% agarose gel was prepared by dissolving agarose in buffer G (20 mM Tris-Base, 200 mM glycine) and then adding 0.02% SDS. A total of 50 μg (for Tg4510 and Tg21221 brain extracts (<Supplementary Fig. 8>)) or 25 μg (for lambda phosphatase experiment (<Fig. 7e>)) of brain extract protein was incubated with 0.02% SDS sample buffer for a total of 7 min at R.T. just before loading. The SDD-AGE was run in Laemmli buffer (Buffer G with 0.1% SDS) at 30 V for 14 h or until the dye front reached the end of the gel. Protein was then transferred via capillary action to Immoblin P (Millipore) membrane at 4 °C for 16–24 h. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk/TBS-T for 1 h and then probed for total tau using rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antibody (#ab64193, Abcam, 1:4,000) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T, probed with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (#172-1019, Bio-Rad, 1:2,000) for 1.5 h at R.T., and washed three times with TBS-T. Membranes were developed using ECL kit (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer, USA) and detected on Hyperfilm ECL (GE healthcare, USA). Immunodepletion of tau from rTg4510 brain extracts was performed using Dynabeads Protein G Immunoprecipitation Kit (#10007D, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. A 0.75 mg of Dynabeads Protein G was incubated with 1 μg of anti-tau antibodies (anti-phospho tau antibodies (see Immunoblot analysis section), total tau antibody (HT7, #MN1000, Thermo Scientific), and control IgG) for 10 min with rotation at R.T. After washing with 200 μl of washing buffer, the Dynabeads-antibody complex was incubated with 300 μl of rTg4510 brain extracts (12-months-old, PBS-3,000g, 500 ng ml−1 human tau) for 10 min with rotation at R.T. Dynabeads-antibody–antigen complex was isolated using a magnetic holder and the supernatant was collected for tau uptake assay and ELISA measurement. After washing three times with 100 μl of washing buffer, Dynabeads-antibody–antigen complex was resuspended in 20 μl of elution buffer and incubated for 2 min at R.T. Dynabeads-antibody complex was isolated using a magnetic holder and supernatant (immunoplecipitated tau) was collected for tau ELISA measurement. In all, 25 μg protein of brain extract (12-month-old rTg4510, PBS-3,000g) was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 400 units of Lambda Protein Phosphatase (NEB) supplemented with 1X NEBuffer for protein metalophosphatase and 1 mM MnCl2, immediately followed by 1 h at 65 °C to inactivate the Lambda Phosphatase enzymatic activity. Brain PBS-soluble extracts, ISF microdialysate, oligomer tau (recombinant hTau-441) mixture solution were separated by SEC on single Superdex200 10/300GL columns (#17-5175-01, GE Healthcare) in phosphate buffered saline (#P3813, Sigma-Aldrich, filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1, with an AKTA purifier 10 (GE Healthcare). Each brain extract was diluted with PBS to contain 6,000 ng of human tau in a final volume of 350 μl, which was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter and then loaded onto an SEC column. The individual fractions separated by SEC were analysed by ELISA (Tau (total) Human ELISA kit, diluted 1:50 in kit buffer). For the ISF sample, 400 μl of microdialysate from rTg4510 mice was loaded onto the column after filtration through a 0.2-μm membrane, and SEC fractions were measured by human tau ELISA. For the oligomer tau mixture solution, 500 μl of sample (hTau-441, 3.35 mg ml−1 with 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter) was loaded onto column and each SEC fraction was diluted 1:200,000 in kit buffer for human tau ELISA. Primary neurons were washed extensively with PBS (three times) and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. Neurons were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min (R.T.), blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS-T (R.T.), and then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in 2% NGS/PBS-T. The following primary antibodies were used to detect tau: mouse monoclonal antibody Tau13 (specific for human tau (aa20-35), #MMS-520R, Covance, 1:2,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-total tau antibody (recognizes both human and mouse tau, #A0024, DAKO, 1:1,000), mouse monoclonal antibody Alz50 (the conformation-specific antibody, courtesy of Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine; 1:100). Goat anti-mouse Alexa488 and anti-rabbit Alexa555 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, 1:1,000) were applied in 2% NGS in PBS-T for 1 h at R.T. CY3-labelled anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:200) was used to detect Alz50. After washing in PBS, coverslips were mounted with aqueous mounting medium (Vectashield). For co-staining with ThioS, neurons were first immunostained with rabbit polyclonal antibody TAUY9 (specific for human tau (aa12–27), #BML-TA3119-0025, Enzo Life Sciences, 1:200) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa555 secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:200), and then incubated with 0.025% (wt/vol) ThioS in 50% ethanol for 8 min. ThioS was differentiated in 80% ethanol for 30 s. Neurons were washed with water for 3 min, and coverslips were mounted using mounting medium (Vectashield)."
PMC4608380_6,"For co-staining with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and GFAP, chicken polyclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (#ab5392, Abcam, 1:1,000) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody (#ab7260, Abcam, 1:1,000) were used for primary antibodies, and CY3-labelled anti-chicken IgG (1:1,000) and anti-rabbit Alexa350 (1:500) secondary antibodies were used to detect MAP2 and GFAP, respectively The subcellular localization of human tau was studied by co-staining with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-TGN46 antibody (the Golgi apparatus marker, #ab16059, Abcam, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-GRP94 antibody (the endoplasmic reticulum marker, #ab3670, Abcam, 1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-LAMP2a antibody (the lysosome marker, #ab18528, Abcam, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab5 antibody (the endosome marker, #ab13253, Abcam, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-catalase antibody (the peroxisome marker, #ab1877, Abcam, 1:200). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa555 secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:200) was used to detect subcellular markers. Images were acquired using confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope, Carl Zeiss). Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and perfused with PBS. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA for 2 days at 4 °C, incubated for 2 days in 30% sucrose in PBS, and then 40-μm-thick sections were cut on a freezing sliding microtome. Sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked in 5% NGS in PBS, and incubated in primary antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody Alz50 (courtesy of Peter Davies, 1:100)) in 2% NGS in PBS overnight at 4 °C. CY3-labelled anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:200) was applied in 2% NGS in PBS for 1 h (R.T.). After washing in PBS, brain slices were mounted on microscope slides, and coverslips were mounted using DAPI containing mounting medium (Vectashield). NFTs were stained with 0.025% ThioS in 50% ethanol for 8 min. ThioS was differentiated in 80% ethanol for 30 s. Sections were washed with water for 3 min, and coverslips were mounted using mounting medium. Human full-length WT tau (2N4R, 441 aa) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 using tau/pET29b plasmid (Addgene). Expression was induced at OD=0.6 by adding 1 mM IPTG for 3.5 h at 37 °C. Tau purification was performed by heat treatment and FPLC Mono S chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously<41>. Cells of 300 ml culture were boiled in 3 ml buffer solution (50 mM MES, pH 6.8, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT) for 20 min. Whole cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 125,000g for 45 min, and supernatant was dialysed (molecular weight cutoff 20 kDa) against 20 mM MES, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. Protein and tau content was determined by BCA assay kit (Pierce), SEC and western blot. Tau oligomer mixture solution was prepared by incubating recombinant human tau (3.35 mg ml−1) with 2 mM DTT for 2 days at 37 °C, followed by SEC separation and ELISA measurement of tau (<Fig. 7a>). We designed a neuron-layering microfluidic platform composed of three distinct chambers connected through microgroove arrays (3 × 8 × 600 μm in height, width and length) using standard soft lithographic techniques<42>. The length of the microgrooves was such that no MAP2-positive dendrites entered the adjacent chambers (<Fig. 3b>), in agreement with earlier observations from Taylor et al.<25> who reported that a 450-μm microgrooves are sufficiently long to isolate axon terminals from soma and dendrites. The platform was punched on two side reservoirs of each chamber and bonded to a poly-D-lysine (50 μg ml−1, Sigma) coated glass-bottom dish (#P50G-1.5-30-F, MatTek Corporation) to enhance neuronal adhesion.First, primary cortical neurons isolated from E15 mouse embryos were plated into the 1st chamber at an approximate density of 0.6 × 105 viable cells (in 10 μl plating medium) per device. After 15 min (most neurons in the 1st chamber adhered to the bottom of dish during this period), 0.3 × 105 viable cells in 2 μl plating medium were loaded into the 2nd chamber via one of the side reservoirs. Microfluidic devices were set at a tilt (∼80° angle) in an incubator (37 °C in 5% CO2) immediately after neurons were plated into the 2nd chamber, so that the neurons would settle down to surfaces close to the third chamber by gravity. Therefore, most neurons in the 2nd chamber were plated in a line along a sidewall of the 2nd chamber, which had microgrooves connecting to the 3rd chamber. We empirically established this protocol to allow most of the axons of neurons in the 2nd chamber to extend into the 3rd chamber (<Fig. 3b>). After 3 h, the devices were set in a normal position without tilting and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in culture medium. The medium was changed every 4–5 days.For tau uptake and the propagation assay, PBS-soluble extracts from rTg4510 and AD brain tissue were added to the 1st chamber (10 μ in total) on 7 or 8 days in vitro. The 2nd and 3rd chambers were filled with 40 μl of media (20 μl in each reservoir). The volume difference between the chambers resulted in continuous concevtion (‘hydrostatic pressure barrier'; 10 μl in the 1st chamber and 40 μl in the 2nd and 3rd chambers), which prevented diffusion of brain extract from the 1st chamber into other chambers. After incubation for the designated periods, neurons were washed, fixed and immunostained as described above (see Immunocytochemistry section).Transfections of GFP and RFP (<Fig. 3c>) were carried out inside microfluidic devices as follows: initially, the 1st chamber neurons (7 DIV) were transfected with GFP (0.04 μg DNA+0.1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (#11668-019, Life Technologies)) in 10 μl of NeuroBasal for 3 h. Diffusion of DNA from the 1st chamber to the 2nd chamber was prevented by a hydrostatic pressure barrier, as described above. After washing the DNA (GFP)-containing medium from the 1st chamber (washed three times with NeuroBasal), the 2nd chamber neurons were transfected with RFP (0.04 μg DNA+0.1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 10 μl NeuroBasal) for 3 h. Diffusion of DNA from the 2nd chamber to the 1st and 3rd chambers was prevented by the hydrostatic pressure barrier (40 μl media in the 1st and 3rd chambers). After washing the DNA (RFP)-containing medium from the 2nd chamber (washed three times with NeuroBasal), devices were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in culture medium. Expressions of GFP and RFP were examined 2 days later.Neurons in the microfluidic device were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Zeiss LSM 510 META (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) confocal scanhead using 488- and 543-nm lasers. All images were acquired using a 25 × APO-Plan Neoflu lens or 63 × 1.2 NA C-APO-Plan Neoflu lens (Carl Zeiss). Cell viability assay with EthD-1 staining (#L-3224, Life Technologies) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with EthD-1 (4 μM in PBS) and Hoechst 33342 (#H3570, Life Technologies, 1 μg ml−1 in PBS) for 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Images were acquired using confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope, Carl Zeiss). Neuronal viability was assessed using a MTT assay kit (TACS MTT Cell Proliferation Assays, #4890-25-K, Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Mouse primary neurons were incubated with HMW or LMW SEC fractions from rTg4510 brain extracts (12-months-old, PBS-3,000g, 10 ng ml−1 human tau) in 96-well plate (Corning, #3603) (2.5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl) for 48 h. MTT (10 μl) was added to each well at 48 h and neurons were incubated for 2 h in an incubator (37 °C in 5% CO2). When purple precipitate is visible under the microscope, 100 μl of detergent reagent was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at R.T. The absorbance of each well was measured at 600 nm in a microplate reader (Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter, Perkin Elmer). All data were expressed as mean±s.e.m.

Scale bar, 50 μm. Tau pathology is known to spread in a hierarchical pattern in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain during disease progression, likely by trans-synaptic tau transfer between neurons. However, the tau species involved in inter-neuron propagation remains unclear. To identify tau species responsible for propagation, we examined uptake and propagation properties of different tau species derived from postmortem cortical extracts and brain interstitial fluid of tau-transgenic mice, as well as human AD cortices. Here we show that PBS-soluble phosphorylated high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau, though very low in abundance, is taken up, axonally transported, and passed on to synaptically connected neurons. Our findings suggest that a rare species of soluble phosphorylated HMW tau is the endogenous form of tau involved in propagation and could be a target for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development. In Alzheimer's disease, tau spreads throughout the brain, however the nature of the tau species propagating from one neuron to another is not known. Here, Takeda et al. identify a rare, high-molecular-weight tau as the primary species taken up and transferred between synaptically connected neurons. ."
PMC5913225_0,"The misfolding and accumulation of tau protein into intracellular aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, while tau propagation is a known marker for disease progression, exactly how tau propagates from one cell to another and what mechanisms govern this spread are still unclear. Here, we report that cellular internalization of tau is regulated by quaternary structure and have developed a cellular assay to screen for genetic modulators of tau uptake. Using CRISPRi technology we have tested 3200 genes for their ability to regulate tau entry and identified enzymes in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic pathway as key regulators. We show that 6-O-sulfation is critical for tau-heparan sulfate interactions and that this modification regulates uptake in human central nervous system cell lines, iPS-derived neurons, and mouse brain slice culture. Together, these results suggest novel strategies to halt tau transmission.

Glenn Center for Aging Research (M.K.). The Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT or tau) is an intrinsically disordered protein that under pathological conditions aggregates into filamentous inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)<1>. While the composition and structure of NFTs are well characterized<2>,<3>, the in vivo process of aggregation is not well understood. The presence of NFTs is characteristic of a number of human diseases, collectively termed tauopathies. In tauopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), NFT pathology advances in a predictable pattern throughout the brain affecting regions involved in learning and memory<4>. This progression of NFT pathology correlates with cognitive decline in patients and permits neuropathological diagnoses of patients in different stages of AD<5>.The spread of protein aggregates during disease progression is a common theme in many neurodegenerative diseases, including α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease<6>, Huntingtin protein in Huntington’s disease<7>, and superoxide dismutase-1 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<8>. However, the exact mechanisms underlying intercellular spread of these aggregates, including tau, is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests the transmission of tau pathology is mediated by the release, uptake, and trafficking of pathogenic or misfolded tau aggregates within synaptically connected neurons<9>,<10>. Once internalized, misfolded tau proteins act as a seed that recruits soluble endogenous tau into growing aggregates<11>. Aggregated tau is proteotoxic in model systems, suggesting that oligomeric and/or fibrillar tau may contribute to neurodegeneration<12>. However, it is unclear how the different quaternary architectures of tau affect internalization and if all structures have the ability to transfer between neurons. Conflicting studies have shown varying results regarding tau uptake with some studies showing internalization of small monomeric or oligomeric tau species<13> and others suggesting that only oligomeric and/or fibrillized tau is internalized<14>. Discrepancies between culture systems and sources of tau protein may account for these differences, but this has not been explicitly tested. Further, a better understanding of the cellular processes that are necessary for transmission of tau aggregates could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies that would inhibit the spread of tau pathology and its consequences. Recent work on α-synuclein has shown that a cell surface receptor, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3), can bind α-synuclein and trigger its endocytosis into neurons<15>. Based on this, and previous observations in the literature<16>, we hypothesized that perhaps a receptor could also exist for tau.Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are a diverse family of proteins modified with the linear sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS). HSPGs are present in virtually all cells and are involved in a multitude of processes including cell attachment, migration, differentiation, and inflammation<17>. HS chains consists of a basic disaccharide building block β-1,4-linked D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and α-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). During assembly, HS chains can be highly modified; GlcNAc residues can be N-deacetylated and N-sulfated, GlcA can be epimerized at C5 to L-iduronic acid (IdoA), and ester-linked sulfate groups can be installed at C2 of the GlcA/IdoA and/or at C6/C3 of the GlcNAc. There is no defined template for HS modification on HSPGs. Thus, the availability of precursor material and abundance of biosynthetic enzymes in the cell are thought to dictate chain length, sulfation pattern, and epimerization<18>. Previous work has implicated HSPGs as a potential receptor for tau internalization<14>,<16>. However, this work has not examined whether specific HSPG proteins or specific HS modifications on these proteins can act as determinants for cellular tau entry, and therefore does not contain the molecular detail that would guide therapeutic strategies. Very recently it has been shown that fragments of tau can discriminate between different sulfation modifications (6-O-sulfation) on heparin<19>. This work showed for the first time that, in vitro, tau can discriminate between very structurally similar glycans and that tau-HS binding was greatly affected by modifications at the 6-O position. Within the cell there are a variety of enzymes known to be important for imparting this information on cellular receptors, thus we envisioned that there might be a specific protein or motif that would allow specification of tau entry.In this work we used central nervous system (CNS) cell lines, iPS-derived neurons, and mouse brain slice culture to understand the guidelines for tau uptake. We find that the quaternary structure of tau dictates the efficiency of uptake and we used tau monomers to screen for genetic modulators of internalization. We found that HSPG-modifying enzymes influence tau internalization and knockdown of these enzymes can repress the uptake of tau. We confirm that 6-O-sulfation patterns on HS chains are critical for tau binding, and show that competition or removal of these motifs on the cell surface reduced the internalization of tau. Tau protein can form multiple quaternary structures in solution, and recent evidence suggests that small tau oligomeric species may play a critical role in the spread of tau pathology and neurotoxicity<12>. Furthermore, work on smaller fragments of tau have suggested that the size of tau can regulate seeding capacity<14>. Therefore, to study the overarching rules that govern the transmission of full length tau, we tested the uptake capacity of various tau structures in a variety of model systems, including human CNS-derived cell lines and iPS-derived neurons.First, we recombinantly expressed and purified the longest isoform of tau, 2N4R, and used established protocols to produce oligomeric and fibrillized tau species (see Methods)."

After one hour, cells were washed, lifted from the plate and analyzed for fluorescence using flow cytometry. To control for non-specific binding to the membrane, identical experiments were performed at 4 °C (a non-permissive temperature for endocytosis), and any fluorescence observed was subtracted from our results. Monomeric, oligomeric and sonicated fibrils were efficiently internalized, while fibril samples were not (Fig. <1c> and Supplementary Fig. <1d>). Tau uptake was a time-dependent process, with uptake observed in as little as 10 minutes (Supplementary Fig. <1a>). This assay for tau uptake was robust for other human CNS cell lines, including SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma, and ReN VM neural progenitors (Supplementary Fig. <1b,c>). Further, human iPS-derived neurons also showed a preference for smaller structures of tau, with fibrillized tau showing nearly no uptake (Fig. <1d>). Taken together, these results suggest that cellular uptake of tau is regulated by size and that large species of tau are inefficiently internalized across multiple cell types. With a robust and high-throughput assay for tau uptake in hand, we used this platform to screen for genetic modulators that could either increase or decrease tau internalization. To do this, we developed an H4 CRISPRi cell line that stably expresses a catalytically inactive Cas9 fusion protein (dCas9-KRAB). CRISPRi represses transcription of genes with high specificity using single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that guide the dCas9-KRAB protein to the transcription start site (TSS) of the targeted gene<21>. As a proof of concept, we screened a next-generation CRISPRi library of sgRNAs that targeted 3200 different genes with five different sgRNAs per gene, and contained hundreds of non-targeting negative-control sgRNAs<22>. H4 CRISPRi cells transduced with sgRNAs were then incubated with 25 nM AF488 labeled 2N4R monomer (2N4R-488) for 1 hr and sorted based on AF488 fluorescence. The cell populations with the top and bottom thirds of AF488 fluorescence, representing higher than average and lower than average tau uptake, respectively, were recovered, genomic DNA was isolated and the locus encoding the sgRNA was PCR-amplified and frequencies of each sgRNA in the two populations were determined by next-generation sequencing (Fig. <2a>). To detect hit genes, we applied our previously developed quantitative framework for pooled genetic screens<23>,<24> as described in the Methods. rhetorical Figure 2 CRISPRi screen for tau uptake modulators.

PMC5913225_2,"To detect hit genes, we applied our previously developed quantitative framework for pooled genetic screens<23>,<24> as described in the Methods We selected sixteen genes for individual validation studies, including genes with particularly strong phenotypes in the primary screen, as well as genes in pathways previously implicated in tau uptake. Fifteen of the sixteen follow-up hits were found to repress expression of their target gene (i.e. knockdown) as determined by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. <2a>). Fourteen of the fifteen gene knockdowns also reproduced their screen phenotype i.e. either increased or decreased tau uptake as compared to a non-targeting sgRNA control (Fig. <2b> and Supplementary Fig. <2b>).Interestingly, we found that some of the strongest phenotypes in our screen were attributed to genes that are known cell cycle regulators (Supplementary Fig. <2c>). The selective knockdown of genes such as TP53, led to a decrease in G1 length and thus an overall increase in cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. <2d>). Endocytosis is known to increase during G1 phase<25>; therefore, it seemed logical that cell cycle regulators that can shorten the G1 phase could reduce the amount of tau uptake and vice versa. In line with these observations a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that causes a stall in G1 phase (PD0332991) was sufficient to almost double the amount of tau taken up in H4 cells (Supplementary Fig. <2e>). Further work will be needed to dissect if and how these genes might influence post-mitotic neurons.Hits that were of particular interest included genes involved in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) biosynthesis (EXT2 and HS6ST1) as well as DNM2, a GTPase involved in endocytosis. These single gene knockdowns repressed uptake of tau monomer by over 50% (Fig. <2b>) and also reduced the uptake of tau oligomers (Fig. <2c>). Further, these gene knockdowns were sufficient to reduce the uptake of tau in iPS-derived neurons (Fig. <2d>). Treatment of cells with an inhibitor for DNM2, Dynasore, was also able to reduce uptake of tau (Supplementary Fig. <2> f). Based on our pilot screen results, we were particularly interested in the enzymes involved in HSPG biosynthesis. Previous reports had indicated that internalization of tau could be regulated by HSPGs<16>, but our identification of HS6ST1, an enzyme that is responsible for 6-O-sulfation of HSPGs, supports a hypothesis that specific motifs on HSPGs might be important for tau uptake.HSPGs are decorated with HS chains that consist of a repeating GlcA-GlcNAc building block. During assembly, HS chains can be highly modified and, importantly for their function, they can be sulfated at multiple sites within the disaccharide (Fig. <3a>). To ascertain whether specific sulfation motifs were important for tau binding, we employed a heparin ELISA assay. In this assay, biotin-labeled heparin derivatives (Fig. <3b>) were immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates, purified tau protein was incubated with the plate at increasing concentrations, and antibodies were used to detect tau binding. Tau bound heparin with an affinity of 4.6 ± 0.6 nM, consistent with previous reports<26>. Over sulfated heparin (>3 sulfates per disaccharide) bound tau even tighter (2.2 ± 0.5 nM), while fully-desulfated heparin showed a drastically reduced binding (>1 μM) (Fig. <3c>). Removal of N-sulfates or 2-O-sulfates had little effect on tau binding (15.0 ± 5 nM and 7.4 ± 1.0 nM, respectively), while removal of all O-sulfates and, in particular 6-O-sulfates, led to a significant decrease in tau binding (>1 μM in each case; Fig. <3c,d>). The relative binding of 6-O-desulfated heparin in the presence of 10 nM tau was 6.9% that of heparin, consistent with our hypothesis that tau interacts with the 6-O-sulfation motif on HS chains, and that HS is important for tau internalization. rhetorical Figure 3 Binding of tau to heparin derivatives.

To confirm that 6-O-sulfation was indeed a determinant of tau uptake, we developed a cellular competition experiment to monitor tau internalization. In this experiment, we added heparin or heparin derivatives free into the cell media immediately prior to addition of 2N4R-488. We found that internalization of tau can be efficiently competed by the presence of heparin or HS in the media (Fig. <4a>). Likewise, addition of 2-O-desulfated heparin was able to reduce uptake, whereas 6-O-desulfated heparin or chondroitin sulfate (negative control) were significantly less effective at reducing uptake (Fig. <4a>). These results were consistent when tested in iPS-derived neurons (Fig. <4b>), demonstrating that the 6-O-sulfation motif is indeed a critical determinant for cellular tau entry. rhetorical Figure 4 6-O sulfation regulates tau uptake in CNS culture.

(f) ICC confirms that Sulf1 and Sulf2 are overexpressed (red) in H4 cells. Hoechst stain is used to label nuclei.

These slices showed normal electrophysiology, suggesting good vitality (Supplementary Fig. <3a>). Their ability to uptake tau was tested by incubating the cultures with 2N4R-488 for 30 min at 37 °C or, as a control, 4 °C. The cultures were washed, stained with Hoechst dye to label nuclei, and mounted on coverslips to image. Incubation at 37 °C showed uptake of tau in the slice cultures, whereas very little fluorescence was observed in the 4 °C control cultures (Fig. <4c> and Supplementary Fig. <3b>). Consistent with our previous results, incubation with heparin, heparan sulfate, or 2-O-desulfated heparin reduced uptake of tau as quantified by the median 488 fluorescence intensity (Fig. <4d>). Chondroitin sulfate and 6-O-desulfated heparin incubation did not reduce the median fluorescence, verifying that 6-O-sulfation is also important for tau internalization ex vivo (Fig. <4d> and Supplementary Fig. <3b>). Quantification of median Hoechst fluorescence across all the images showed that similar cell numbers were analyzed for each condition (Supplementary Fig. <3c>).Finally, in order to test if direct removal of 6-O-sulfates from the cell surface could reduce uptake of tau in cell culture, we overexpressed two different extracellular endosulfatases (Sulf1 & Sulf2) that selectively cleave 6-O-sulfates on GlcNAc<28>. Overexpression of these enzymes in H4 cells, showed a dramatic decrease in tau uptake with Sulf1 reducing uptake to 17 ± 9%, and Sulf2 reducing uptake to 36 ± 15% (Fig. <4e>). Overexpression of the constructs was confirmed with immunocytochemistry and qPCR analysis (Fig. <4f> and Supplementary Fig. <3d>) and the ability of the enzymes to reduce 6-O sulfation on the cell surface was confirmed by HPLC (Supplementary Fig. <3e,f>). In recent years, a growing body of literature has reinforced the hypothesis that prion-like cell-to-cell propagation of protein aggregates underlies disease progression of numerous neurodegenerative disorders<29>. For some of these protein aggregates (PrP, α-synuclein), specific pathways and protein conformers that are key for transmission have been delineated quite fully<15>,<30>. However for other proteins, such as tau, many details regarding its transmissibility are still unclear. It has been shown in various cellular and animal models that exogenously added tau aggregates can induce tau pathology;<9>,<13> however, the disparity between the experimental systems and the tau species used in each study makes it hard to draw a unifying theme. Tau is a complex protein that has several isoforms, posttranslational modifications, and the ability to form multiple quaternary structures<31>. Therefore, we have focused our research on the development of a cellular assay that can robustly detect internalization across various tau constructs and CNS cell systems.The data presented here demonstrate that full-length human tau (2N4R) can be efficiently internalized across multiple relevant cell systems and that this uptake is dependent on the overall size of the tau species, similar to what has been seen before for smaller fragments of tau<14>. By screening through thousands of potential gene regulators, we have identified enzymes involved in HSPG synthesis/modification as critical modulators of tau internalization. This is a critical point, since it is still debated exactly how tau induces neurotoxicity. One hypothesis suggests that tau oligomers are the toxic species and that the formation of tau fibrils inside neurons (NFTs) could be a protective mechanism. This is supported by neuropathological studies measuring oligomeric tau (MC1+) in AD patients which show that neuronal loss and cognitive deficits correlate with increased MC1 reactivity and that these changes precede NFT formation<32>. Our data are consistent with this hypothesis, as tau fibrils were unable to be internalized, and thus would be unable to “seed” misfolding inside the cell. Our results also indicate that both monomeric and oligomeric tau are internalized with similar efficiency and presumably using similar cellular mechanisms, since genetic regulators of monomer tau uptake also affect oligomer uptake. However, this work has only focused on uptake mechanism of “naked” tau and has not focused on seeding potential or the possibility of exosome transfer of fibrils between neurons<33>. But, as tau oligomers and monomers have been found elevated in the CSF of AD patients<34>,<35> and tau antibodies have been shown to block tau spreading<36>,<37> it seems likely our assay recapitulates at least one in vivo scenario.Using CRISPRi technology, we identified multiple genetic factors that can influence the uptake of tau in cell culture. The identification of HSPGs as regulators of tau internalization is not an entirely new concept. Indeed, it has been known for years that tau can bind heparin, and that this molecule can be used as an in vitro inducer of aggregation<38>. Tau internalization has also been linked to HSPGs previously<16>, and the data presented here adds more detail to the molecular picture and confirms previous in vitro work that identified 6-O sulfation as a major determinant of tau binding<19>. The HSPG family consists of over 12 members, with a wide array of HS sulfation modifications and chain length complexity. Our comprehensive analysis has shown that binding of tau to HS in a cellular context is directly related to the sulfation pattern, and specifically on the presence of 6-O sulfates on the glucosamine subunit. Further work will be needed to understand if there are specific HS chain lengths or regions on tau that are important for this interaction.This work is an important step forward in the characterization of HS-tau interactions. With these new insights we can begin to envision ways to design small molecules that mimic the HS structures that interact with tau to block its aggregation and neutralize its toxicity. It is plausible to expect that novel treatments that target the HS-tau interaction may contribute to AD treatment and could improve the effects of other treatments.

PMC5913225_4,"Full length tau protein (2N4R, 1-441aa) was purified with slight modification to previously published protocols<39>  Briefly, 2N4R tau in the pRK172 plasmid was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cell pellets were harvested and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EGTA) + cOmplete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). Lysate was sonicated, boiled for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then precipitated with ammonium sulfate (20% w/v) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended into 4 mL of MonoS Buffer A (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EGTA) and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The protein was loaded onto a MonoS column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl using MonoS Buffer B (Buffer A + 1 M NaCl). Fractions containing 2N4R tau were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight into PBS pH 7.4. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific).Protein was labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488 or 647 5-SDP ester (Life Technologies) according to the suppliers instructions. After labeling, 100 mM glycine was added to quench the reaction and the proteins were subjected to Zeba desalting columns (Thermo Scientific) to remove any unreacted label. Average label incorporation was between 1 and 1.5 moles/mole of protein, as determined by measuring fluorescence and protein concentration (Amax x MW of protein/[protein] x εdye). To prepare tau fibrils and oligomers, 10 uM protein, in PBS 1 mM DTT pH 7.4, was mixed with heparin (0.05 mg/ml) and incubated with shaking at 37 °C. The formation of oligomers was observed after 4 h of shaking, whereas fibril formation was formed after 5 days<13>. To make sonicated fibril samples, fibrillized protein was sonicated using a MiSonix Sonicator 4000 (QSonica, LLC) at 50% amplitude for 60 1 s pulses. Mutation of 2N4R (C291S, C322S) to remove both cysteine residues important for dimer formation allowed us to further confirm that tau monomer could indeed be internalized (data not shown). Tau fibrils and sonicated fibrils (1 μM) were absorbed on 200-mesh formvar-coated copper grids, washed, and stained with a 2% uranyl acetate solution. Grids were then imaged with a JEOL JEM-1230 (JEOL USA, Inc) at the indicated magnifications. Protein solutions (1 μM) were filtered (0.45 μm) and analyzed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern). The time-dependent autocorrelation function of the photocurrent at a fixed angle of 175° was acquired every 10 s, with 15–20 acquisitions for each run and with at least three repetitions. The error bars displayed on the DLS graphs were obtained by the standard deviation (SD) between replicates. H4 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. SHSY-5Y cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. ReN-VM cells were cultured on Matrigel (Corning) coated plates in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 μg/ml heparin (STEMCELL Technologies), 2% B27 (Life Technologies, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 μg/ml bFGF (Stemgent), 20 μg/ml EGF (Sigma). Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of H4 cells with Sulf1 (Addgene #13003) or Sulf2 (Addgene #13004) were performed with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions and cells were assayed 48 h later. Overexpression was confirmed with immunocytochemistry using the his tag epitope and qPCR. For competition experiments, heparin (and various derivatives) was added to the media just prior to tau addition at the indicated concentrations. CRISPRi iPSc with an inducible TRE3G-dCas9KRAB-T2A-mCherry were maintained in 6-well Matrigel (Corning) coated plates with mTeSR1 media (STEMCELL Technologies) and split with ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies) at a 1:20 ratio every 4–5 days. For differentiation, CRISPRi cells were split with Accutase and virally infected twice with a NeuroD1-IRES-eGFP-Puro (Addgene #45567) according to previously published methods<40>. Doxycyclin was added to induce expression of NeuroD1, and the following day cells were selected with puromycin (5 μg/ml). After selection, cells were lifted with Accutase treatment and replated 1:12 in PEI coated 24-well plates. Three days later, media was changed to Brain Phys Neuronal Medium (STEMCELL Technologies) with doxycycline and AraC to remove any remaining dividing cells. At day 8, cells were infected with specific sgRNA constructs. iPS neurons were assayed between days 14–18 of maturity as described below. Immunocytochemistry was used to confirm neuronal properties (Supplementary Fig. <1e>). H4 cells were plated at 50,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate. The next day media was replaced, and cells were treated with varying concentrations of AF488-labeled tau protein for 1 h (unless indicated otherwise) at 37 °C. For ReN-VM uptake experiments the media was replaced with DMEM/F12 without B27 or heparin. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and trypsinized to lift cells from the plate. Identical control experiments were performed at 4 °C to confirm that tau protein was internalized and not just adhering to the cell membrane. Lifted cells were analyzed using an Accuri-C6 Flow Cytometer and propidium iodide was used to exclude dead cells from the analysis. We generated a stable CRISPRi-enabled H4 neuroglioma cell line by transducing H4 cells with the lentiviral plasmid pHR-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB<41> and selecting a polyclonal population of BFP-expressing cells by FACS. These cells were transduced with a next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA library (sublibrary “Cancer and Apoptosis”)<22>, and transduced cells were selected using puromycin (1 μg/mL). Media was replaced with fresh DMEM containing AF488-labeled Tau monomers at a final concentration of 25 nM for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice, trypsinized, and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% FBS). A BD-FACAria II, was used to sort live cells into two populations based on the top and bottom thirds of AF488 fluorescence; approximately 15 million and 17 million cells were recovered from the high- and low-fluorescence populations, respectively. The resulting DNA was isolated, the cassette encoding the sgRNA was amplified by PCR, and relative sgRNA abundance was determined by next-generation sequencing as previously described<21>,<24>. We analyzed the resulting data using our previously developed quantitative framework for pooled genetic screens<23>,<24>. Statistical significance for each targeted transcription start site was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the phenotypes of the 5 sgRNAs targeting the transcription start site to the phenotype distribution of the 280 non-targeting sgRNAs in the library. Heparin was purchased from AMSBio (AMS.HEP001-100) and all heparin derivatives were purchased from Neoparin (GT6011, GT6012, GT6013, GT6014, GT6020, GT6030). Heparin/heparin derivatives were biotinylated by reacting their free amines (estimated abundance of 1–5% for heparin) with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, heparin/heparin derivatives and biotin reagent were combined in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Excess reagent was removed, buffer exchanged for Milli-Q water, and samples concentrated by centrifugation with Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL Centrifugal Filters (Millipore, 3k cut-off). For ELISA assays, biotinylated heparin/heparin derivatives were immobilized on streptavidin plates followed by a 2 h incubation with 2N4R tau protein containing a C-terminal myc tag (10-fold dilution series). Bound tau was detected using an anti-myc HRP-conjugated antibody (Bethyl, A190-105P), visualized using TMB substrate (R&D Systems), and quantified by UV-Vis. Absorbance for each plate was measured at 450 and 550 nm. The 550 nm measurement is a correction for plate imperfections and was subtracted from the 450 nm values."
PMC5913225_5,"Data were normalized to heparin controls and fit with a Hill binding mathematical model where appropriate using the equation Y = Bmax*XH/(KdH + XH), where H is the Hill slope (variable), X is the concentration of tau, and Bmax is the binding maximum  Protocols and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Santa Barbara and were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Slice cultures were prepared as previously described<27>. Hippocampal excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were measured using a multi-electrode array (MEA). Stimulus current was injected into a region of the hippocampal slice by an MEA electrode, with the magnitude of stimulus current ranging from 20–80 μA. EPSPs were then measured by recording an electrode in a different region of the hippocampal slice. Smaller stimulus currents excite fewer cells, and thus the measured EPSPs have smaller magnitudes. Purelink RNA Extraction Kit (Invitrogen) was used to isolate RNA from samples. RNA (1 μg) was then converted to cDNA using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase III (Invitrogen) according to the supplier’s instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to QuantStudioTM 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR System protocol. GAPDH mRNA level was used to normalize samples. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked for 1 hr in blocking buffer at RT (1% BSA, 300 mM Glycine, 0.1% Gelatin, 4% Donkey Serum in TBST). After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The day after cells were washed three times (5 min each) with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. The following primary antibodies were used: Tau-46 (Invitrogen, 36400, 1:1000), MAP2 (Millipore, AB5622, 1:1000), and anti-his (Thermo Scientific, MA1-21315, 1:1000). Secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, A21422, A21206, 1:1000) were incubated for 1 hr at RT, washed three times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS and imaged with an Olympus IX71 Microscope or an Olympus Fluoview 1000 Spectral Confocal. Cells pellets of WT, Sulf1, and Sulf2 overexpressing cells were resuspended in PBS and digested with pronase (final concentration 2 mg/mL) overnight at 37 °C. Samples were passed through a 0.22-µm syringe filter to remove cell particulates and applied to DEAE-cellulose columns equilibrated with 0.2 M NaCl in PBS. The columns were extensively washed with 0.2 M NaCl in PBS, the GAGs eluted with 1.0 M NaCl in PBS, and the eluted fractions combined, flash-frozen and lyophilized. Purified GAGs were digested using a combination of heparinases I, II, and III, and the resultant disaccharides were isolated by size filtration and subsequently labeled with AMAC, as previously described<42>. AMAC-labeled HS was lyophilized and reconstituted in 50% DMSO and stored at −20 °C prior to analysis.Sample analysis was performed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 RP-HPLC column (4.6 mm × 75 mm, 3.6 mm; Agilent Technologies) running on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system. Samples were diluted with 60 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.6) and applied to the column, which was equilibrated in 98% solution A/2% solution B (A: 60 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.6; B: acetonitrile). The column was held at 2% solution for 0.5 min, and the AMAC-labeled disaccharides were then eluted over a shallow gradient of 2–12% solution B over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Disaccharides were detected in-line by UV-Vis (260 nm). The column was regenerated with 95% solution B prior to equilibration. To confirm peak identities, eight standards purchased from Iduron (∆UA2S – GlcNS6S, HD001; ∆UA2S – GlcNS, HD002; ∆UA2S – GlcNAc6S, HD003; ∆UA – GlcNS6S, HD004; ∆UA – GlcNS, HD005; ∆UA – GlcNAc, HD006; ∆UA2S – GlcNAc, HD007; ∆UA – GlcNAc6S, HD008) were labeled with AMAC and spiked into cell-derived samples. The misfolding and accumulation of tau protein into intracellular aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, while tau propagation is a known marker for disease progression, exactly how tau propagates from one cell to another and what mechanisms govern this spread are still unclear. Here, we report that cellular internalization of tau is regulated by quaternary structure and have developed a cellular assay to screen for genetic modulators of tau uptake. Using CRISPRi technology we have tested 3200 genes for their ability to regulate tau entry and identified enzymes in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic pathway as key regulators. We show that 6-O-sulfation is critical for tau-heparan sulfate interactions and that this modification regulates uptake in human central nervous system cell lines, iPS-derived neurons, and mouse brain slice culture. Together, these results suggest novel strategies to halt tau transmission. ."
PMC3314430_0,"Previously, we reported the characterization of two novel antibodies that react with tau nitrated at tyrosine 197 (Tau-nY197) and tyrosine 394 (Tau-nY394) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this report, we examined whether tau nitration at these sites also occurs in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick’s disease (PiD), three neurodegenerative tauopathies that contain abundant tau deposits within glial and neuronal cell types but lack amyloid deposition. The reactivity of these antibodies was also compared to two previously characterized antibodies Tau-nY18 and Tau-nY29, specific for tau nitrated at tyrosine 18 and tyrosine 29, respectively. In the present experiments, Tau-nY18 did not label the classical pathological lesions of CBD or PSP but did label the neuronal lesions associated with PiD to a limited extent. In contrast, Tau-nY29 revealed some, but not all classes of tau inclusions associated with both CBD and PSP but did label numerous Pick body inclusions in PiD. Tau-nY197 was restricted to the neuropil threads in both CBD and PSP; however, similar to Tau-nY29, extensive Pick body pathology was clearly labeled. Tau-nY394 did not detect any of the lesions associated with these disorders. In contrast, extensive neuronal and glial tau pathology within these diseases was labeled by Tau-Y197, a monoclonal antibody that reacts within the Y-197-containing proline-rich region of the molecule. Based on our Western and IHC experiments, it appears that nitration of tau at tyrosine 29 is a pathological modification that might be associated with neurodegeneration. Collectively, our data suggest that site-specific tau tyrosine nitration events occur in a disease and lesion-specific manner, indicating that nitration appears to be a highly controlled modification in AD and non-AD tauopathies. The authors would like thank Katherine Gasho and Dr. Eileen Bigio from the CNADC of Northwestern University for kindly providing the tissue necessary to complete this study. We are grateful to Dr. Rohan de Silva for kindly providing us with the RD3 and RD4 antibodies and Dr. Sarah Ward for critical readings of the manuscript. This work is supported by NIH awards AG 14449 (L.I.B.), AG 21184 (L.I.B.), AG 032091 and AG 013854 to the Northwestern University Alzheimer’s Disease Center (C.G.). Alzheimer’s disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick’s disease (PiD) are a diverse group of neurodegenerative tauopathies that share several pathological similarities, notably progressive accumulation of modified tau proteins in selective brain regions [<29>]. Non-AD tauopathies, however, differ significantly from AD in several ways. First, non-AD tauopathies are rare disorders that exhibit a variety of clinical features including cognitive and motor deficits [<30>]. Second, non-AD tauopathies are uniquely characterized by the intracellular aggregation of the tau protein within both glial and neuronal cell types, affecting mostly the frontal neocortex, basal ganglia, deep cerebellar nuclei as well as certain elements of the limbic system [<8>, <29>]. Third, unlike AD which involves the self-aggregation of all six tau isoforms [<14>, <15>], non-AD tauopathies exhibit remarkable selectivity in tau isoform aggregation (for review, see [<21>]). For instance, tau isoforms containing four microtubule binding repeats (4R) compose the major tau inclusions identified within the glial and neuronal cell types in both CBD and PSP [<9>, <28>]. In contrast, aggregates formed in PiD are largely composed of tau isoforms containing three microtubule binding repeats (3R) [<6>]. Furthermore, the formation of amyloid plaques, a well-known pathological hallmark in AD, is not considered to be a pathological marker in these rare tauopathies, indicating that tau may serve as the primary agent of neurodegeneration. Support for this contention is provided by the discovery of mutations within the tau gene associated with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), leaving little doubt that the altered tau protein alone is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration [<10>, <23>, <34>].In AD, the temporal and spatial progression of tau inclusion formation correlates well with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [<1>, <3>]. Although relatively little is known about this process in non-AD tauopathies, recent findings indicate that formation of tau aggregates in these diseases is similar but not identical to those found in AD [<17>]. For instance, several modifications associated with tau aggregation identified during early stages of tangle formation in AD have also been documented in non-AD tauopathies, including the Alz-50 conformation [<4>] and several phosphorylation events within tau [<2>]. However, as tau inclusions mature, post-translational modifications known to occur during the intermediate (Tau-C3, Tau-66) or late (MN423) stages of tangle formation in AD are absent in these rare tauopathies [<4>, <17>]. These observations suggest that tau inclusions in non-AD tauopathies are likely processed differently by the cells, indicating potential mechanistic divergence between the pathogenesis leading to AD versus non-AD tauopathies.In a previous report, our laboratory characterized two nitration-specific monoclonal antibodies termed Tau-nY18 and Tau-nY29 which react with tau nitrated at tyrosine 18 and tyrosine 29, respectively [<36>, <39>]. In AD, Tau-nY18 localized largely to reactive glia cell types, whereas Tau-nY29 recognized the classic tau pathology in tissue sections [<36>, <39>]. In non-AD tauopathies, Tau-nY29 revealed several pathological features associated with CBD, PSP and PiD suggesting that tau at tyrosine 29 was susceptible to nitration in all tauopathies including AD [<39>]. Intriguingly, Tau-nY18 did not detect either the neuronal or the glial tau lesions characteristic of CBD or PSP, indicating that tau nitration within the glial pathology in AD may be different from the glial pathology in these rare tauopathies [<36>]. In the present report, we compared the nitration of tau at tyrosine 18 and tyrosine 29 with nitration of tau at tyrosine 197 and tyrosine 394 using antibodies selective for tau nitrated at each of these residues [<35>]. Collectively, our data signify that site-specific nitration events occur within the tau molecule in a disease- and lesion-specific manner, indicating that nitration is likely a highly controlled modification in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Frozen blocks from the frontal cortex were obtained from the Northwestern University Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center (CNADC) Brain Bank (<Table 1>). Sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions were prepared as previously reported [<20>]. Briefly, 1 g of frozen tissue was homogenized in solution A (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose) at 4°C and centrifuged at 23,000×g for 15 min. The supernatant from this centrifugation containing the bulk of the soluble tau was discarded. The pellets were then extracted in solution A containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 386,000×g for 20 min also at 4°C. The resultant pellets were subsequently homogenized in solution A containing 1% sarkosyl, incubated at 37°C for 1 h and centrifuged at 386,000×g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant from this spin was used as the sarkosyl-soluble tau fraction. The sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were then solubilized in 7 M guanidine and dialyzed in Tris–EDTA at 4°C overnight using a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce, Rockford IL) and stored at −80°C until further use as the sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions. Wild type (ht40) and mutant tau proteins (on the ht40 background) were expressed using a pT7C-tau plasmid which drives the expression of the full-length human tau (441 amino acids) fused to an amino terminal 6X His affinity tag [<4>]. Four tau mutants, each containing a single tyrosine (Y) residue at position Y18, Y29, Y197, or Y394 were generated by mutating all of the other native tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (F) as previously described [<37>]."
PMC3314430_1,"Mutant and wild type proteins were treated with peroxynitrite to induce tyrosine nitration [<41>]  Briefly, purified proteins were buffer exchanged into nitration buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate and 0.1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) [<25>], then treated with 100-fold molar excess of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (Cayman Co, Arbor, MI) at room temperature with constant stirring; samples were then stored at −80°C until further use. The peroxynitrite concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 302 nm in 0.3 M NaOH (ε302 = 1,670 M −1 cm−1) prior to each experiment [<41>]. Peroxynitrite treatment resulted in proteins nitrated at tyrosines in wild type tau (nht40), and in mutant proteins at Y18 (nY18), Y29 (nY29), Y197 (nY197), and Y394 (nY394). Tau harboring only a single tyrosine residue at tyrosine 310 was not used in this study because previous work demonstrated that tau is seldom nitrated at this site in vitro [<37>]. Human tau samples (<Table 1>) were separated on 10% SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Where noted, membranes were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP, 10 U/ml in Tris buffer saline) overnight at 4°C to remove phosphate groups (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Membranes were then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After rinsing, membranes were incubated in peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG H + L secondary antibodies for an hour at room temperature (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and then washed and incubated with ECL substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Signal was visualized on Kodak Bio-max XAR film (VWR International, Batavia, IL). Human postmortem brain tissue fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde was obtained as free-floating 40-μm thick sections from the CNADC Brain Bank (<Table 1>). Tissue sections from frontal cortex and hippocampus from pathologically diagnosed cases with CBD, PSP and PiD were processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously [<12>, <13>]. Where noted, CIP treatment was performed to remove phosphate groups from proteins (as described above) prior to processing sections for immunohistochemistry. Sections were then incubated with Tau-nY18 (1 μg/ml), Tau-nY29 (1 μg/ml), Tau-nY197 (40 ng/ml), Tau-Y197 (1 μg/ml), or Tau-nY394 (cell culture medium) at 4°C overnight (<Table 2>). After rinsing in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibodies (μ-chain or γ-chain specific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), followed by an hour incubation in avidin–biotin complex solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then developed with metal enhanced 3,3′-diaminobenzine (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and mounted onto glass slides, air dried overnight, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared with xylenes, and coverslipped with Permaslip (Alban Scientific Inc., St. Louis, MO). Primary antibody dilutions employed were predetermined by testing serial dilutions on adjacent tissue sections to assure the use of subsaturating primary antibody concentrations. Double-label immunofluorescence was performed as previously described [<12>] and tissue sections were incubated with Tau-nY18 (1 μg/ml), Tau-nY29 (1 μg/ml), Tau-nY197 (20 ng/ml), Tau-Y197 (1 μg/ml) or Alz-50 (0.2 μg/ml) antibodies overnight at 4°C (<Table 2>). Sections were then incubated with either a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse γ-chain specific or a Texas-red-conjugated goat anti-mouse μ chain-specific secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Autofluorescence due to lipofuscin was blocked with Sudan Black (0.05%) in all sections analyzed [<12>, <24>]. All images were captured as z-stacks of single optical sections using a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. To demonstrate that each nitro-specific tau antibody (Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29, Tau-nY197, and Tau-nY394) reacts exclusively with the correct nitro-tyrosine residue within the tau molecule, wild type recombinant (ht40) and mutant tau proteins containing a single tyrosine residue at position Y18, Y29, Y197 or Y394 were nitrated in vitro using ONOO- and then tested by ELISA (<Fig. 1>). As expected, each monoclonal antibody selectively bound to nitrated wild type tau (nht40) and mutant proteins containing a nitro-tyrosine corresponding to their specific epitope (<Fig. 1a>; <Table 3>). The high selectivity of these antibodies with their respective immunogen is due to their recognition of the nitro-group (NO2) in the context of the surrounding amino acids comprising each epitope, as the peptides used to generate these antibodies were unique (<Fig. 1b>). It is worth mentioning that Tau-nY18 and Tau-nY29 appear to have a greater affinity to nitrated wild type tau at Y18 and Y29 compared to Tau-nY197 and Tau-nY394, likely due to the in vitro selectivity of the nitrating agent (ONOO−) for tau’s N-terminal tyrosine residues as previously reported [<37>]. The presence of total tau within these samples was confirmed using Tau-Y197 and Tau-5 (<Fig. 1c>), pan tau antibodies that react with all tau proteins. Note, however, that Tau-Y197 fails to react with mutant proteins singly nitrated at Y18, Y29 or Y394 since part of this antibody’s epitope requires a tyrosine residue that has been mutated to phenylalanine within these constructs [<35>]. Although nitration of the phenol group does not affect Tau-Y197’s reactivity, the presence of the tyrosine hydroxyl group appears to be obligatory [<35>]. In order to investigate whether the hallmark pathological lesions of CBD contained nitrated tau, immunohisto-chemical analysis (IHC) was performed on tissue sections from the frontal cortex using Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29, Tau-nY197, and Tau-nY394. In cases pathologically diagnosed with CBD, Tau-nY18 did not label the lesions characteristic of the disease, even when CIP treatments or epitope retrieval methods were applied (<Fig. 2a>), a result that was similar to that previously reported [<36>]. However, in contrast to the earlier results, one case did show a limited number of Tau-nY18-stained neuropil threads that were present within the gray matter of the frontal cortex following citric acid retrieval methods (<Fig. 2b>, arrowheads) [<33>], suggesting that a minor degree of nitration at this site is possible within some aggregates in CBD. In contrast, Tau-nY29 labeled a subset of CBD-associated pathology that included the perinuclear inclusions (<Fig. 2c>, asterisk), neuropil threads as well as a limited number of ballooned neurons (<Fig. 2f>). Similar to Tau-nY18, the glial pathology associated with this disorder was not labeled using the Tau-nY29, even when sections were subjected to several epitope retrieval methods (data not shown). Tau-nY197 only labeled a subset of neuropil threads that were present mostly within the gray matter of the frontal cortex (<Fig. 2d>, arrowheads). However, unlike Tau-nY18 or Tau-nY29, CIP treatment of tissue sections was required to unveil this epitope, suggesting that phosphorylation within the Tau-nY197 epitope prevents antibody binding as shown previously in tissue sections from brains pathologically diagnosed with AD [<35>]. As expected using the pan tau antibody Tau-Y197, numerous ballooned neurons with extensive processes protruding from the cell bodies (<Fig. 2e>), as well as the coiled bodies (<Fig. 2e>, arrowhead), and the distal processes of astrocytes commonly known as astrocytic plaques (<Fig. 2h, i>) were clearly labeled following CIP treatment, confirming that phosphorylation within the Y197 or nY197 epitopes inhibit antibody binding in CBD [<35>]. Finally, as was found in AD cases [<35>], Tau-nY394 did not detect any tau inclusions associated with the disorder even after several epitope retrieval methods were performed (<Fig. 2g>)."
PMC3314430_2,"To determine whether the tau inclusions observed in CBD contain nitrated sarkosyl-soluble or sarkosyl-insoluble tau, frozen tissue blocks from cases pathologically diagnosed with CBD were fractionated as outlined in “Methods” and as reported previously [<20>], processed for Western blot analysis, then blotted with Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29, Tau-nY197, and Tau-nY394 (<Fig  2j>). Tau-nY18 did not react with the sarkosyl-soluble tau fractions but did label the sarkosyl-insoluble tau proteins in all CBD cases analyzed. Tau-nY29 labeled the sarkosyl-soluble tau but did not react with any of the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions, a result that is strikingly opposite to that observed using Tau-nY18. Tau-nY197 reactivity was shown within both the soluble and insoluble tau fractions, a result that is similar to the results shown from non-demented controls as well as AD brains [<35>], suggesting that nitration at this site may be a normal event within tau as previously suggested [<31>]. It is worth noting that within the sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions, Tau-nY197 appears to label more proteolytic fragments than Tau-nY18. This difference could be due to truncation events at the N-terminus hypothesized to occur at D25 that would eliminate nitration at tyrosine 18 in these proteolytic fragments [<22>, <40>]. Finally, similar to our IHC results, Tau-nY394 did not react with any of the CBD samples analyzed, a result that somewhat mimics those in cases pathologically diagnosed with AD [<35>]. To confirm the presence of 3R and 4R tau isoforms within these samples, the RD3 and RD4 tau antibodies were used (<Fig. 2k>). These antibodies selectively label tau proteins containing either 3R or 4R tau isoforms, respectively [<5>]. Note that both RD3 and RD4 antibodies label the sarkosyl-soluble fractions however, the RD3 antibody reacted poorly with the insoluble fractions, indicating that within the CBD cases analyzed, the majority of tau in the insoluble state is composed mainly of 4R tau isoforms. Total tau within these samples was labeled with Tau-12 [<22>], an antibody that binds to the N-terminal region of the molecule and does not discriminate between 3R or 4R tau isoforms (<Fig. 2k>). We then stained brain sections from pathologically con-firmed PSP cases with each of the nitro-specific antibodies. As expected, Tau-nY18 did not label the tau inclusions characteristic of this disorder as previously reported [<36>]. Unlike CBD, epitope retrieval methods had no effect on any of the tissue sections analyzed (<Fig. 3a>). Tau-nY29 clearly labeled the globose tangles (<Fig. 3b>) as well as a few neuropil threads [<39>]. However, the thorny and tufted astrocytic lesions associated with this disorder were not detected. Tau-nY197 reacted poorly with the globose tangles but did label the coiled bodies (<Fig. 3c>, asterisk) and the neuropil threads to a limited extent following CIP treatment (<Fig. 3d, e>, arrowheads). In contrast, Tau-Y197 labeled a large number of neuropil threads (<Fig. 3g>), globose tangles (<Fig. 3h>, asterisks) as well as the thorny and tufted astrocytes (<Fig. 3i>, asterisk and arrow, respectively). Similar to Tau-nY197, CIP treatment was required to reveal the tau aggregates in PSP using Tau-Y197, indicating that both CBD and PSP may exhibit similar phosphorylation events that target the proline rich region of the tau protein. Once again, Tau-nY394 did not label any tau inclusions in PSP tissue sections even after epitope retrieval or CIP treatments were performed (<Fig. 3f>).To determine whether tau nitration was present in the sarkosyl-soluble and/or the sarkosyl-insoluble state, Western analysis was performed as above (<Fig. 3j>). Tau-nY18 did not label the sarkosyl-soluble tau fractions but did label the sarkosyl-insoluble tau isolated from PSP frontal cortex (<Fig. 3j>). Tau-nY29 labeled the sarkosyl-soluble fractions but failed to react with the sarkosyl-insoluble tau within the PSP cases analyzed. Tau-nY197 labeled both the soluble and insoluble fractions but Tau-nY394 failed to show any reactivity, suggesting nitration at tyrosine 394 does not occur in either CBD or PSP.As shown for CBD, the RD3 and RD4 antibodies robustly labeled the soluble tau fractions in PSP, suggesting that our soluble tau preparations from CBD and PSP contain a mixture of both 3R and 4R tau isoforms. As expected, the RD3 antibody did not label the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions in PSP, as the tau inclusions associated with this disorder are mainly composed of tau containing the 4R tau isoforms. Note, however, that the RD4 antibody also failed to react with these fractions, a result similar to that previously reported [<20>]. The lack of reactivity of the RD4 antibody with insoluble PSP tau is surprising, since this antibody clearly labels recombinant tau proteins containing 4R isoforms [<5>]. The presence of total tau within these samples was shown by its reactivity with Tau-12 (<Fig. 3k>), rendering this finding even more enigmatic (see “Discussion”). Finally, to determine whether the pathological lesions commonly known as Pick bodies contain nitrated tau, tissue sections from PiD cases were processed for IHC and incubated with all nitro-specific tau antibodies. Unlike CBD or PSP, Tau-nY18 did label a few Pick body inclusions, although a citric acid retrieval method was required to obtain reactivity (<Fig. 4a>). In contrast, extensive Pick body labeling was observed using Tau-nY29 and Tau-nY197 (<Fig. 4b–e>, asterisks). Furthermore, the ramified astrocytic pathology characteristic of this disorder was also labeled using both antibodies (<Fig. 4c, d>, arrowheads). Similarly, Tau-Y197 labeled abundant neuropil threads (<Fig. 4h>), neuronal Pick body pathology (<Fig. 4g, h>), coiled bodies (<Fig. 4i>, arrowheads) and the ramified astrocytic pathology (<Fig. 4j>, arrowheads) following CIP treatment. As was the case for CBD and PSP, Tau-nY394 did not label the pathology in any of the PiD cases analyzed (<Fig. 4f>).We then investigated whether the Pick brain homogenates also contain nitrated soluble or insoluble tau using Western blot analysis. As was the case in CBD and PSP, Tau-nY18 did not label the sarkosyl-soluble fractions and only one PiD case appears to show reactivity in the sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions. Tau-nY29 demonstrated limited reactivity in the sarkosyl-soluble fraction and did not label the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, even though abundant Pick body pathology was observed by IHC (<Fig. 4b, c>). However, it is important to note that in the cases used for Western blotting there was very little Tau-12 immunoreactivity in the sarkosyl-soluble fraction (<Fig. 4l>), therefore one might expect less labeling with Tau-nY29 because the proportion of nitrated tau is certainly less than the proportion of total tau. In contrast to CBD and PSP, Tau-nY197 poorly labeled both the sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble fractions (<Fig. 4k>), whereas Tau-nY394 showed no reactivity in either fraction.Abundant sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau was clearly labeled using the RD3 antibody (<Fig. 4l>). Note that the RD4 antibody did not react with the insoluble fractions, indicating that most of tau within this fraction is mainly composed of the 3R variety. The sarkosyl-soluble tau fractions displayed only labeling of a few proteolytic fragments with RD4 indicating that most of tau within the sarkosyl-soluble fractions is of the 3R variety. Tau-12 robustly labeled the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions, but as shown with Tau-nY197 and RD4 antibodies, it reacted poorly with the sarkosyl-soluble fractions, largely recognizing proteolytic fragments. However, the uncleaved tau was clearly labeled using the RD3 antibody again suggesting that 4R tau is largely absent from both sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble fractions. Due to the widespread labeling of nitrated tau within the Pick body pathology using Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29, and Tau-nY197, we investigated whether these nitration events are associated with tau modifications that occur early in AD [<16>]."
PMC3314430_3,"Double-label immunofluorescence was performed using a monoclonal antibody known to recognize tau in a conformation where the N terminus interacts with the microtubule binding region of the molecule (Alz-50), an event thought to facilitate tau aggregation during the initial stages of tangle formation in AD [<4>]  Notably, our qualitative observations revealed that while most Pick body inclusions labeled with Tau-nY18 and Tau-nY29 appear to co-localize with the Alz-50 antibody (<Fig. 5a–i>), some Tau-nY29-positive Pick bodies were found that lacked Alz-50 reactivity (<Fig. 5d–i>, arrowheads). Similarly, some Alz-50-positive inclusions were identified that lacked Tau-nY29 labeling (<Fig. 5g–i>, asterisk). In contrast, while some Tau-nY197-positive Pick body inclusions and some ramified astrocytes co-localized with tau in the Alz-50 conformation (<Fig. 5j–o>, arrowheads), most Pick body inclusions positive for Tau-nY197 did not (<Fig. 5m–o>, asterisks), suggesting that nitration at Y197 might precede the formation of the Alz-50 conformation in PiD as it does in AD. However, although unlikely, it is also possible that nitration at this site occurs after the Alz-50 conformation vanishes as the inclusions mature; additional cases and stereological techniques may be necessary to further validate this hypothesis. In the present study, we investigated the presence or absence of nitrated tau within CBD, PSP and PiD using two novel antibodies Tau-nY197 and Tau-nY394 [<35>] and compared the reactivity to two previously characterized antibodies termed Tau-nY18 and Tau-nY29 [<36>, <39>]. As previously reported, all but one antibody identified nitrated tau within the pathological inclusions associated with AD [<5>, <22>]. Herein, we consider the differences between the nitration state of tau within the fibrillar tau aggregates in non-AD tauopathies and tau’s nitration state in AD. Our findings suggest that while nitration at specific tyrosine sites may be indicative of a pathological event associated with neurodegeneration, nitration at other residues is likely a normal tau modification within the human brain (<Table 4>). Although several attempts were made to reveal the pathological tau inclusions reacting with Tau-nY18 by performing numerous epitope retrieval methods in non-AD tauopathies, very few were observed by IHC (<Table 2>). These findings are consistent with our previous results which indicated that Tau-nY18 does not label the tau inclusions associated with either CBD or PSP by IHC [<36>]. However, following citric acid retrieval methods, one CBD case did appear to have a limited number of neuropil threads that were clearly positive for Tau-nY18. Similarly, a select number of Pick body inclusions were also positive for Tau-nY18 in PiD; however, the vast majority were unlabeled.In addition to the few neuronal tau inclusions detected by Tau-nY18 in AD, this antibody mainly labeled the reactive glial cells that were associated with amyloid plaques [<36>]. While glial tau inclusions are part of the hallmark tau pathology associated with CBD, PSP and PiD, Tau-nY18 did not label any of the glial inclusions in these disorders, suggesting that nitration of tau at tyrosine 18 may be associated with the generation of amyloid deposits which are largely absent in the non-AD tauopathies [<36>].That said, Western analysis revealed that Tau-nY18 reactivity was readily detected within the sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions isolated from severe AD cases [<36>]. However, it was also found within the sarkosyl-soluble tau fractions isolated from non-cognitively impaired controls [<36>]. By contrast, Tau-nY18 labeled the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions in CBD, PSP and PiD (<Table 4>), but did not label the sarkosyl-soluble fractions even though the samples were isolated from the same brain region (frontal cortex) as that assayed in non-demented controls [<36>]. This indicates that nitrated sarkosyl-soluble tau may be selectively garnered by the insoluble fraction as part of the disease processes active in these non-AD tauopathies.Although Tau-nY18 reacted with insoluble tau by Western analysis, this antibody seldom labeled the tau inclusions in non-AD tauopathies (<Table 4>). This result may be due to the sensitivity of the Western technique compared to IHC. Alternatively, it is also possible that Tau-nY18 is labeling a tau aggregate that has yet to become a part of a readily identifiable pathological inclusion. In one specific PiD case, Tau-nY18 did not react with sarkosyl-insoluble tau even though abundant insoluble tau was detected using Tau-12 and RD3 antibodies (<Table 4>). These findings suggest that some tauopathy cases may be susceptible to nitration at Y18 while others are not. Clearly, nitration of tau at tyrosine 18 is variable in PiD cases and is not required for tau inclusion formation.Perhaps, our most interesting finding regarding nitration of tau at tyrosine 18 is that it is readily detectable in sarkosyl-soluble tau within the frontal cortex of normal controls and within cases pathologically diagnosed with AD. All of these suggest that nitration of tau at this site may be a post-translational modification involved in a normal biological function. However, additional studies are necessary to validate this hypothesis. Unlike Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29 clearly labeled a select number of neuronal tau lesions associated with CBD and PSP. However, similar to Tau-nY18, the hallmark glial lesions associated with these disorders were never labeled, even after numerous epitope retrieval methods were applied to tissue sections [<33>]. These findings indicate that the glial cell types in CBD or PSP are not susceptible to nitration at tyrosine 18 or 29. In contrast, numerous neuronal and glial tau inclusions were clearly labeled in PiD using Tau-nY29, suggesting that nitration of tau at tyrosine 29 is a more frequent event in this tauopathy (<Table 2>).Western blot analysis indicated that Tau-nY29 reacted with the sarkosyl-soluble fractions in both CBD and PSP but did not react with any of the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions analyzed (<Table 4>). This is exactly the opposite result to that obtained using Tau-nY18. Although the meaning of these findings remains unclear, it does serve to differentiate between CBD and PSP cases based on the aggregation state and the selective nitration of two closely spaced tyrosine residues within the tau molecule.In contrast to our IHC observations in PiD, Tau-nY29 did not react with either the sarkosyl-soluble or sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions in any of the cases analyzed by Western analysis (<Table 4>). These results may be explained by a potential proteolytic event within tau at D25 [<40>], which would certainly eliminate Y18 and perhaps render Y29 non-nitratable. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of Tau-12 reactivity, a pan-tau antibody whose epitope is also within the N-terminal region of the molecule and would be eliminated by a truncation at D25. Alternatively, it is also possible that the lack of Tau-nY29 reactivity is not due to the cleavage of proteins but rather to a post-translational modification or a conformation within the molecule that prevents antibody binding. Some credence is lent to this hypothesis by the binding of the RD3 antibody to tau polypeptides migrating at the normal apparent molecular weight. However, even though Tau-nY29 did not bind tau in PiD via Western analysis, it reacted well with Pick bodies via IHC. Unfortunately, the cases used in IHC experiments were different from those analyzed by Western blots (<Table 1>). Hence, one could posit many reasons for the differences that might include the IHC-staining structures being so insoluble that they do not enter even a stacking gel. It should be noted that tau in most NFTs in AD is truncated on its carboxy end and yet evidence for such truncation is never seen in sarkosyl-insoluble biochemical preparations from human AD brains [<11>, <19>, <32>].In AD, Tau-nY29 labeled the sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions by Western analysis (Braak stage V–VI; <Table 4>)."
PMC3314430_4,"However, in contrast to Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29 did not react with the sarkosyl-soluble tau fractions isolated from non-cognitively impaired controls [<39>]  These findings suggest that nitration at this site may be strictly a pathological modification because (1) it occurs within some of the hallmark tau pathologies in both AD and non-AD tauopathies and (2) its presence in sarkosyl-soluble tau appears to be disease-dependent (PSP and CBD). Similar to Tau-nY18, Tau-nY197 reacted with a limited number of tau inclusions associated with CBD and PSP by IHC (<Table 2>). In PiD however, a number of Pick body inclusions were clearly labeled using Tau-nY197. Similarly, in AD, Tau-nY197 selectively localized to the pathological inclusions associated with the disease, including the NFT, neuropil threads and neuritic plaques [<35>].Western analysis further revealed abundant nitrated tau at tyrosine 197 within the sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble fractions in CBD and PSP and to a limited extent in PiD, a result that does not match the limited nitration events observed using IHC in CBD and PSP or the abundant labeling in PiD (<Tables 2>, <4>). In AD, Tau-nY197 reactivity was present not only within the sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions but also within sarkosyl-soluble tau isolated from non-cognitively impaired controls [<35>]. These findings suggest that nitration at tyrosine 197 like nitration at tyrosine 18 may be a normal modification within tau [<36>, <39>].Overall, the reactivity of these monoclonal antibodies (Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29, and Tau-nY197) with non-AD tauopathies suggests that tau aggregates composed mainly of 3R tau isoforms may be more susceptible to nitration than tau inclusions composed mainly of 4R tau isoforms (<Table 2>). However, relatively little is known about tau inclusion progression and its association with cognitive decline in these rare tauopathies (<Table 1>). In contrast to the nitro-tau antibodies shown above, nitration of tau at tyrosine 394 was not detected in any of the disease states analyzed (<Tables 2>, <4>). The lack of nitration at tyrosine 394 in these rare diseases was somewhat expected based on previous results that indicated nitration at this site occured to only a limited extent within sarkosyl-insoluble tau aggregates isolated from severe AD cases [<35>]. However, tyrosine 394 was shown to be nitrated in vitro [<37>, <38>]; therefore, it may be that a truncation event at the C terminus of tau can remove this residue eliminating nitration at this site [<27>]. Another possibility is that nitration at this site in AD and these rare disease states may be masked by the presence of a phosphorylation at tyrosine 394 [<7>, <27>, <42>]. Indeed, previous work by Hanger and colleagues [<18>] identified phosphorylation of tyrosine 394 in AD using Edman degradation and mass spectrometry analysis. Phosphorylation at tyrosine 394 would likely preclude nitration on the same tyrosine residue. It is worth mentioning that in PiD, no full-length sarkosyl-soluble tau was identified with any of the nitro-specific antibodies used, and only a limited amount was detected with the Tau-12 antibody (<Fig. 4>), an extremely high titer tau antibody. The RD3 result, however, clearly demonstrates the presence of 3R tau in these fractions and Tau-12 certainly binds to 3R tau proteins (unpublished observations). It is possible that nitrated sarkosyl-soluble tau may be a subset of total soluble tau and not sediment during the isolation of the sarkosyl-soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions, or be so insoluble as to not enter even the stacking gels during Western analysis. Alternatively, the PMI from these diseases may have negatively contributed to these observations (<Table 1>). It must also be noted that different cases were used for IHC and Western analysis and therefore these results must be interpreted with caution. In addition, one of the PiD cases analyzed by Western analysis was diagnosed with a familial mutation of PiD (<Table 2>) which may also contribute to the discrepancy of our results. Certainly, more PiD cases of soluble and insoluble tau fractions must be analyzed to confirm these findings.Overall, the findings presented herein and those published previously [<35>, <36>, <39>] indicate that tyrosine nitration occurs on tau with site-selective specificity in normal and diseased brain states and suggests that nitration at specific tyrosine sites (Y18 and Y197) may subserve a normal biological function that remains to be elucidated. The shear specificity of nitration events at specific tyrosine residues among non-demented control subjects and those with different disease states suggests a potential enzymatic event or events that may be responsible for nitration [<26>]. Support for this contention is further obviated by the report of nitration at Y197 in the brains of young wild type mice [<31>]. Indeed, nitrating enzymes would add another level of cellular control to events dependent on tyrosine phos-phorylation and signal transduction. rhetorical Fig. 1 Determination of relative antibody affinities to non-nitrated and nitrated tau proteins by ELISA. a Tau-nY18, Tau-nY29, Tau-nY197, and Tau-nY394 were incubated with wild type tau (ht40), wild type nitrated tau (nht40) and nitrated mutant tau proteins containing a single tyrosine residue at position Y18, Y29, Y197 or Y394. Note that each antibody selectively binds to wild type nitrated tau and mutant proteins that correspond to its epitope. b The selectivity of these antibodies is due to both the nitro-tyrosine group and the amino acids surrounding it. c Total tau within these samples was labeled using Tau-Y197 and Tau-5, antibodies that bind to both 3R and 4R tau. Tau-Y197 did not react with mutant proteins nitrated at Y18, Y29 and Y394 as these proteins have a Y → F substitution at position 197. Note that all peptides contain an additional cysteine residue at the carboxy end of the sequence to facilitate binding to maleimide-activated KLH for immunizations rhetorical Fig. 2 Limited tau tyrosine nitration in CBD. a In most cases pathologically diagnosed with CBD, Tau-nY18 did not stain the characteristic lesions of the disease, although one case b did show some neuropil thread staining following citric acid treatment. c Tau-nY29 reacted with the perinuclear inclusions as well as some f globose tangles. d Tau-nY197 only labeled the neuropil treads following CIP treatment. g Tau-nY394 did not label any inclusions. e Numerous globose tangles, coiled bodies (arrow), h, i as well as the astrocytic plaques were labeled using Tau-Y197. j Western blot analysis of soluble and insoluble tau extracts demonstrates that Tau-nY18 did not label soluble tau but did label the insoluble fractions. Conversely, Tau-nY29 labeled soluble but not insoluble tau. Tau-nY197 labeled both, the soluble and insoluble fractions, while Tau-nY394 did not label either of the fractions analyzed. k Abundant soluble tau was detected with RD3, RD4 and Tau-12. The insoluble fractions, however, were only labeled with RD4 and Tau-12 antibodies. In all panels, calibration bars represent 20 μm rhetorical Fig. 3 Selective tau tyrosine nitration in PSP. a Tau-nY18 did not label the pathological inclusions associated with PSP. b Tau-nY29 reacted with the globose tangles and with c the perinuclear inclusions but d, e Tau-nY197 localized to the neuropil threads following CIP treatment. f Tau-nY394 did not label any of the pathological lesions associated with PSP. g Tau-Y197 reacted with numerous neuropil threads and h globose tangles (asterisk) as well as i the thorny (asterisk) and tufted astrocytes associated with PSP. j By Western blot analysis Tau-nY18 did not react with the soluble tau but did label the insoluble fractions whereas Tau-nY29 labeled soluble tau but not insoluble fractions. Tau-nY197 labeled both the soluble and insoluble fractions, while Tau-nY394 did not react with any fractions analyzed. k Abundant soluble tau was detected with RD3, RD4 and Tau-12. The insoluble fractions, however, were only labeled with the Tau-12 antibody."

In this report, we examined whether tau nitration at these sites also occurs in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick’s disease (PiD), three neurodegenerative tauopathies that contain abundant tau deposits within glial and neuronal cell types but lack amyloid deposition. The reactivity of these antibodies was also compared to two previously characterized antibodies Tau-nY18 and Tau-nY29, specific for tau nitrated at tyrosine 18 and tyrosine 29, respectively. In the present experiments, Tau-nY18 did not label the classical pathological lesions of CBD or PSP but did label the neuronal lesions associated with PiD to a limited extent. In contrast, Tau-nY29 revealed some, but not all classes of tau inclusions associated with both CBD and PSP but did label numerous Pick body inclusions in PiD. Tau-nY197 was restricted to the neuropil threads in both CBD and PSP; however, similar to Tau-nY29, extensive Pick body pathology was clearly labeled. Tau-nY394 did not detect any of the lesions associated with these disorders. In contrast, extensive neuronal and glial tau pathology within these diseases was labeled by Tau-Y197, a monoclonal antibody that reacts within the Y-197-containing proline-rich region of the molecule. Based on our Western and IHC experiments, it appears that nitration of tau at tyrosine 29 is a pathological modification that might be associated with neurodegeneration. Collectively, our data suggest that site-specific tau tyrosine nitration events occur in a disease and lesion-specific manner, indicating that nitration appears to be a highly controlled modification in AD and non-AD tauopathies. ."
PMC4455164_0,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary mechanism by which intracellular proteins, transcription factors, and many proteotoxic proteins with aggregation-prone structures are degraded. The UPS is reportedly downregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders, with increased proteasome activity shown to be beneficial in many related disease models. Proteasomes function under tonic inhibitory conditions, possibly via the ubiquitin chain-trimming function of USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). We identified three specific RNA aptamers of USP14 (USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3) that inhibited its deubiquitinating activity. The nucleotide sequences of these non-cytotoxic USP14 aptamers contained conserved GGAGG motifs, with G-rich regions upstream, and similar secondary structures. They efficiently elevated proteasomal activity, as determined by the increased degradation of small fluorogenic peptide substrates and physiological polyubiquitinated Sic1 proteins. Additionally, proteasomal degradation of tau proteins was facilitated in the presence of the UPS14 aptamers in vitro. Our results indicate that these novel inhibitory UPS14 aptamers can be used to enhance proteasome activity, and to facilitate the degradation of proteotoxic proteins, thereby protecting cells from various neurodegenerative stressors. We are grateful to Dain Bang, Ji Hyeon Kim and Dong Hoon Han for their assistance in the screening experiments. We would also like to thank Kyeong Kyu Kim and Eunice Eun-Kyeong Kim for supplying us with DUBs. This work was supported by grants from the Disease Oriented Translational Research (HI14C0202 to M.J.L.) and Korea-UK R&D Collaboration grant (HI14C2036 to M.J.L.) of the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, the Basic Science Research Program (2013R1A1A2059793 to J.H.L.), and National Research Foundation grants funded by the Korean Government (2012M3A9B2028336 to D.-E.K.). Proteasomes are the primary proteolytic machinery used by cells for homeostasis of various regulatory proteins. This catabolic process is mainly mediated by ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteolysis, but when the proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins, they can be degraded by proteasomes in a Ub-independent manner<1>. The 26S proteasome is a multimeric complex, composed of a 28-subunit core particle (CP or 20S complex) and a 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP, PA700, or 19S complex)<2>. The RP recognizes the polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains of its substrates, deubiquitinates them before proteasomal proteolysis is initiated, and translocates the substrates to the catalytic cavity of the CP.The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) appears to have its own quality control mechanisms, one of which is accomplished by the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) USP14 and UCH37<3>. UPS14 interacts with RPN1, while UCH37 binds to ADRM1/RPN13<4><5>. Both are located on the RP, relatively far from the substrate entry pore and the Ub receptors RPN1 and RPN10. UPS14 and UCH37 are thought to mediate stepwise disassembly of the Ub chain from the distal end<6>. This “chain-trimming” effect can delay proteasomal degradation by weakening the interaction between the Ub receptors of the proteasomes, and the polyUb chains of the substrates. Deletion of the USP14 gene, or chemical treatment with USP14 inhibitors, results in accelerated proteasomal degradation of various target substrates<7>. These findings suggest that USP14 is a potential therapeutic target for treating diseases where toxic proteins accumulate. However, it has also been reported that the trimming of Ub chains might promote proteasomal degradation<8>. The mechanism regulating this remains to be elucidated, but probably involves the rate of Ub chain-trimming on the proteasome in coordination with substrate translocation.Aptamers are molecules composed of single-stranded nucleic acids (15–50 bases) that have been generated by an in vitro selection process from a large pool of random sequences. This technique is known as systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)<9><10>. Since the introduction of SELEX technology, a wide range of biological targets, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, cells, tissues and organisms, have been reported to bind to aptamers with high specificity. Aptamers are often referred to as “chemical antibodies,” and are one of only a few classes of biomolecules that can be manufactured to bind to multiple different targets. RNA aptamers have been isolated and shown to have stable conformations in vivo, following some modification. They can specifically bind to proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus Tat<11>, reverse transcriptase<12>, hepatitis C virus NS3 protease/helicase<13><14>, NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase<15>, and severe acute respiratory syndrome NTPase/helicase<16>. In addition, RNA aptamers can bind to prostate cancer cells through the extracellular portion of the prostate-specific membrane antigen<17>, and to brain tissue<18>.Aptamers that bind to specific proteins can repress the enzymatic activity of those proteins or protein-protein interactions. The active sites or interacting motifs usually offer more exposed heteroatoms, which mediates hydrogen bonds or other strong interactions with the aptamers<19>. For therapeutic applications, inhibitory aptamers are often chemically modified to be resistant to degradation mediated by serum. The age-related macular degeneration drug pegaptanib is a 27-nt aptamer that targets vascular endothelial growth factor. It is conjugated with 40 kDa polyethylene glycol and contains inverted nucleotides at the 3′ terminus<20>. Considering the rapid progress in aptamer biology and related technologies, aptamers are now considered essential for understanding and modulating various pathophysiological processes.To overcome the limitation of small-molecule USP14 inhibitors, we identified three novel USP14-binding RNA aptamers that suppressed the deubiquitinating activity of USP14 in vitro. Consistent with the effects of USP14 upon the proteasome, these USP14 aptamers enhanced proteasome activity, and facilitated the degradation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-implicated tau proteins. The inhibitory USP14 aptamers were non-cytotoxic and effectively relieved proteopathic stress in cultured cells. Therefore, UPS14 aptamers could offer an interesting alternative to delay the aggregation process of toxic, aggregation-prone proteins. We transformed pGEX-2T, pGEX-2T-USP14, and pGEX-2T-USP14(C114A) into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). We purified USP14 and USP14(C114A) and their glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated counterparts [GST-USP14 and GST-USP14(C114A), respectively] using previously described methods<7>, with some modifications. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C, and when the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was 0.6–0.8, we added IPTG to each culture (final concentration of 1 mM), and allowed cultures to incubate overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor cocktails and lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation, lysates were filtered and supernatants incubated with GST sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, GST-USP14 was eluted using 10 mM reduced glutathione (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). The GST tag was removed by incubating protein fractions with thrombin in a cleavage buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol] for 3 h at room temperature (RT). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with benzamidine sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) to remove any residual thrombin. Purified GST (data not shown), GST-USP14, GST-USP14(C114A), USP14, and USP14(C114A) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) to determine the size and purity of proteins (<Fig. 1A>)."
PMC4455164_1,"A random RNA library was generated as previously described<21> using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), T7 in vitro transcription, and a DNA template (109 bp) containing 40 random nucleotides  Briefly, the aptamer library template DNA (5′-GGG TTC ACT GCA GAC TTG ACG AAG CTT -40 N-A ATG GAT CCA CAT CAT CTA CGA ATT C-3′) was generated by PCR using a forward primer (5′-GAT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTT CAC TGC AGA CTT GAC GAA-3′) containing the T7 promoter sequence (underlined) and a reverse primer (5′-TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3′) (<Fig. 1B>). The RNA aptamer library was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM NTPs) at 37 °C for 4 h. Products were treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C for 30 min, subjected to 12% denaturing urea PAGE using, and purified from gels. A 6-μg aliquot of each generated RNA pool was incubated with 100 μL of GST sepharose 4B resin in binding buffer [30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)] for 30 min at RT with occasional shaking. The RNA-bead complexes were transferred to porous centrifuge columns (Pierce), and RNA pools that were unbound to sepharose resin were collected by centrifugation. The same procedure was performed using 2 μg of GST proteins to remove RNAs that were nonspecifically bound to GST or glutathione resin. During each round of selection, GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 6 μg of pre-cleared RNA pools in 100 μL of binding buffer for 30 min at RT, and then with 100 μL of GST sepharose 4B resin for an additional 30 min at RT. The quantity of GST-tagged proteins was gradually decreased (2 μg, rounds 2–8; 1 μg, round 9; 0.5 μg, rounds 10–11; 0.25 μg, rounds 12–13; and 0.125 μg, rounds 14–15) to achieve more stringent conditions. The RNA-GST-USP14 complexes were then washed three times with PBS, and eluted with 20 mM glutathione in binding buffer. Eluted RNAs were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, reverse-transcribed with AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer), and amplified by PCR. The amplified cDNA was purified using the AccuPrep Gel purification kit (Bioneer) and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase for the next round of selection (<Fig. 1C>). After 15 rounds of selection, the resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified using forward (5′-GAT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTT CAC TGC AGA CTT GAC GAA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3′) primers. Amplicons were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The secondary structure of selected RNA aptamers was predicted by the Mfold program based on the Zuker algorithm (http:\\\\mfold.rna.albany.edu). For subsequent activity testing and inhibition assays, individual RNA aptamers were amplified by PCR using forward (5′-ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG G-3′) and reverse (5′-TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3′) primers, and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. We used 40-nt sequences that were irrelevant to USP14 aptamers as controls (UUU GUC UAG CGC GUA GUG GGG AGA UGU UGU GAU ACU GGG G). We loaded and immobilized 2 pmol of GST-USP14 or GST onto a GST sepharose 4B resin, and then added 20 pmol of RNA aptamers. The RNA eluted from the resin was reverse-transcribed and the resulting cDNA subjected to PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by ethidium bromide staining, was carried out to visualize protein-bound RNA in 2% (w/v) agarose gels. For cloning, we used primers USP14-1 mutant (5′-GCA GTG ATG TGC TTC TAA AAA ACA ACC TAA AAA AAT TGC C-3′), USP14-2 mutant, (5′-CTG AAA AAA AGT TAG TTT CGC TGG TTT AAA ATC GGT GCG G-3′), and USP14-3 mutant (5′-AAA AAA AAG GCT CGT TTG GCC TGC CGA AAA AAG GCC GGG A-3′). The USP14 aptamer mutants were generated by insertion of corresponding oligonucleotides into the pcDNA 3.1 vector, amplified by PCR using the same forward and reverse primers, and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase as described above. Human proteasomes were purified by affinity chromatography from a stable HEK293 cell line harboring biotin-tagged human β4 as previously described<7>, with some modifications. Cells were cultured in 15-cm dishes, harvested in lysis buffer [50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT] containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with streptavidin agarose resin (Millipore) for 5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer and TEV buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM ATP, and 10% glycerol). The 26S proteasome was eluted from the resin by incubating with TEV protease (Invitrogen) in TEV buffer for 1 h at 30 °C, and concentrated using an Amicon ultra-spin column (Millipore). To inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of proteasomes, ubiquitin-vinylmethylester (Ub-vme; LifeSensors) was added as previously described<22>. Residual Ub-vme was removed by washing the beads three times with 50 bed volumes of washing buffer. Proteasomes (240 ng) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 4–20% gradient gel. Gels were stained using the EzWay silver staining kit (Koma Biotech) or CBB. The obtained proteasomes, which we designated vme-proteasomes, were tested to confirm the elimination of deubiquitinating activity using the Ub-rhodamine 110 hydrolysis assay (Ub-rho110, LifeSensors) (data not shown). The effect of USP14 aptamers on the interaction of USP14 with the proteasome was investigated using proteasome affinity pulldown assays. After HEK293 cells were harvested in lysis buffer, cell lysates were homogenized using a 1 mL syringe with a 26G × 1/2′′ needle. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with RNA aptamers for 10 min, and then with streptavidin agarose resin (Millipore) for 5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The binding of USP14 to the 26S proteasome was monitored by western blotting using an antibody against USP14 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc). Based on the hydrolysis of fluorogenic succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (suc-LLVY-AMC) peptides, the chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes was measured to determine their proteolytic activity. A suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis assay was carried out using purified proteasome and 12.5 μM suc-LLVY-AMC (Enzo Life Sciences) in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT). The Ub-rho110 hydrolysis reaction was carried out using proteasomes or USP14 activated by vme-proteasomes, along with 20 nM or 100 nM Ub-rho110 in the presence or absence of 1 μg/mL (equivalent to 33 nM) RNA aptamers. RNA aptamers were incubated with proteasomes for 5 min before they were added to substrates. To examine the effects of RNA aptamers on USP14, RNA aptamers were incubated with USP14 for 5 min, then with vme-proteasomes for 5 min, before they were added to substrates. UCHL3 and USP47 were kindly provided by Eunice Eun-Kyeong Kim; USP5 was provided by Kyeong Kyu Kim. Proteasomal activity and deubiquitinating activity were monitored by measuring free AMC or rho110 fluorescence, respectively, in black 96-well plates using a TECAN infinite m200 fluorometer. For kinetic analysis, the Ub-rho110 hydrolysis activity of USP14 on USP14 aptamers was monitored over a concentration course. Normalization of fluorescence intensity to the concentration of rhodamine 110 was achieved using a free rhodamine 110 standard curve (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The KM and kcat parameters were determined by nonlinear regression fit, with a model derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation, using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Inc., USA) Polyubiquitinated Sic1 with PY motifs (Ub-Sic1) was prepared as previously described<23>, with some modifications. The Ub conjugation reaction was conducted by incubating 10 pmol of Sic1PY, 2 pmol of Uba1, 5 pmol of Ubc4, 5 pmol of Rps5, and 1.2 nmol of Ub in a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM ATP, and 10 mM MgCl2) for 4 h at 25 °C."
PMC4455164_2,"Conjugates were absorbed to a Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Germany), washed with buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 0, 50 mM NaCl, and 40% glycerol), eluted with 200 mM imidazole in wash buffer, and dialyzed into wash buffer containing 10% glycerol. Recombinant tau and CHIP proteins were expressed and purified from pET29b vectors using conventional purification methods. Unphosphorylated tau (0.5 μg) was incubated with 200 ng of Uba1, 4 μg of UbcH5b, 2 μg of CHIP, 1 μg of HSP70, and 10 μg of Ub for 2 h at RT in a 100-μL reaction. Purified human proteasomes (5 nM) were incubated with 20 nM Ub-Sic1 or Ub-tau in proteasome assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). In certain instances, USP14 was incubated with proteasomes for 5 min before reactions were initiated. To examine the effects of RNA aptamers on in vitro degradation assays, aptamers were incubated with USP14 for 5 min before USP14 was added to proteasomes. Reactions were terminated by adding 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau degradation was monitored by immunoblotting, using antibodies against T7 (Millipore) and tau (clone Tau-5, Invitrogen), respectively. All cells in this study were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. USP14 aptamer transfection was performed in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected for 6 h and whole cell extracts were collected 24 h after the media was changed. Cell viability was assessed using a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay<24>. HeLa cell cultures that were approximately 90% confluent in 96-well plates were treated with control or USP14 aptamers complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 at various concentrations (up to 50 μg/mL) for 4 h. We then added 10 μL of MTT solution to each well and incubated plates at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 2.5 h. Media was discarded and 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. The absorbance of the solution at 570 and 630 nm was determined. Triplicate wells were assayed for each condition. Cell survival was also assessed when tau was induced by Dox, and when oxidative stress was induced by paraquat. Inducible tau cell lines were incubated with Dox (250 pg/mL) and paraquat (1 mM) for 3 h and then transfected with USP14 aptamers. An inducible tau cell line (HEK293-trex-htau40)<25> was transfected with USP14 aptamers and treated with various concentrations of Dox. After 24 h, whole-cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer and used for immunoblotting. Where necessary, cells were treated with 80 μg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) (Enzo Life Sciences) before harvesting. For SDS-PAGE, each lane was loaded with the extract from an equal cell number, generally corresponding to 10-20 μg/lane, or 1/10 of the sample recovered from one well of a 6-well plate. We previously showed that yeast and mammalian USP14, a proteasome-associated DUB enzyme, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of proteasomes<6><7>. The Ub chain-trimming effect of USP14 might antagonize the degradation of many proteasome substrates, with small molecule inhibitors facilitating proteolysis. However, small molecule inhibitors exhibit relatively high cytotoxicity and low inhibitory efficacy<7>. To identify USP14 aptamers, we used SELEX techniques with GST-USP14 (78 kDa), while USP14 (53 kDa) was also expressed and purified for subsequent analysis with aptamers and proteasomes (<Fig. 1A>).To select for RNA aptamers with a high affinity that were specific to USP14, we generated a pool of RNAs (approximately 10<14> molecules) containing a 40 nt random core sequence that was flanked by the T7 promoter site at the 5′ end and primer-binding sites at the 3′ end (<Fig. 1B>)<16>. Prior to initial screening, we performed negative selection over 15 rounds to remove non-specific RNAs bound to the glutathione-sepharose resin or to GST proteins from the RNA pool (<Fig. 1C>). The stringency of RNA binding to the USP14 protein was increased as the rounds progressed (see Methods).Human 26S proteasomes were purified from a HEK293-derived cell line that stably expressed polyhistidine- and biotin-tagged β4 subunits<26>. Purified proteasomes showed an approximate 1:1 molar ratio between the RP and CP complexes (<Fig. 1D>). Basal deubiquitinating activity of USP14 is strongly activated by proteasomes, although the subunit responsible for activation remains to be elucidated<4><21>. The majority of proteasomal deubiquitinating activity was irreversibly blocked using Ub-vme<5>, which forms an adduct with Cys in the active site of the thiol protease DUB. The resulting vme-proteasomes appeared to retain the components of normal 26S proteasomes (<Fig. 1D>). Large amounts of USP14 were co-purified with the RP of proteasomes (<Fig. 1E>). When covalently modified by Ub-vme, the electrophoretic mobility of USP14 was reduced by 7.5 kDa, which corresponded to the size of Ub (<Fig. 1E>), which indicates that the DUB enzymes on the proteasomes, including USP14, were fully inactivated. We examined the RNA sequences of 20 randomly selected clones, and identified three different aptamers. These RNA aptamers were designated USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3, and represented 30 (6/20), 45 (9/20), and 25% (5/20) respectively, of the identified aptamers (<Fig. 2A>). All of the aptamers contained conserved sequences and similar structural motifs, as predicted by Mfold<27>. In addition to two stem-loops in their secondary structures (<Fig. 2B>), there was a sequence of five conserved nucleotides (GGAGG), followed by a G-rich sequence. Our results suggest that the exposed GGAGG and G-rich sequences in RNA aptamers could be important for interactions with USP14.None of the USP14 RNA aptamers was found to bind to GST-tagged proteins from the binding assay similar to the SELEX strategy (<Fig. 2C>), however they all exhibited a high affinity to USP14. The control RNA aptamers did not bind to USP14 (<Fig. 2C>). Mutations in the consensus GGAGG and G-rich sequences in the USP14 RNA aptamers abolished their ability to bind to USP14 (<Fig. 2C>). These findings suggest that the exposure of GGAGG and G-rich sequences in RNA aptamers is critical for their interaction with USP14.To investigate the effects of USP14 aptamers on USP14-mediated deubiquitinating activity, the RNA aptamers were transcribed and purified in vitro. We used recombinant USP14 proteins and vme-proteasomes for hydrolysis of Ub-rho110, a highly sensitive fluorogenic substrate of DUBs. In the absence of vme-proteasomes, USP14 exhibited little deubiquitinating activity. In contrast, USP14 was activated in the presence of vme-proteasomes, exhibiting higher Ub-rho110 hydrolysis activity than for vme-proteasomes alone (<Fig. 2D>). The addition of USP14-1, USP14-2, or USP14-3 to the reaction resulted in a decrease in USP14 deubiquitinating activity (<Fig. 2D> and <Supplementary Fig. 1>). Inhibition of deubiquitinating activity by USP14 aptamers was specific to USP14, with the USP14-3 aptamer failing to inhibit the DUB activity of UCHL3, USP47, USP5, and UCHL5/UCH37 (<Fig. 2E>). USP14-3 inhibited USP14 deubiquitinating activity in a dose-dependent manner (<Fig. 2F> and <Supplementary Fig. 2>). The catalytically inactive mutant of USP14, USP14(C114A), exhibited little deubiquitinating activity and was unaffected by the USP14 aptamers (<Fig. 2D,F>), indicating that the USP14 aptamers specifically inhibit USP14 DUB activity.Using Ub-rho110, we also measured the enzyme kinetics of recombinant USP14 with vme-proteasomes in the presence and absence of the aptamers (<Supplementary Fig. 3>). The KM of USP14 bound to the aptamers (1716 ± 300 nM) was significantly higher than that for free USP14 (1124 ± 248 nM). However, kcat values were comparable regardless of whether USP14 aptamers were present (0.948 ± 0.079 s−1 for USP14-3 vs. 0.938 ± 0.073 s−1 for control RNA aptamers), suggesting that the USP14 aptamers might affect substrate binding to USP14 to a greater extent than deubiquitinating activity."
PMC4455164_3,"Further work will be required to determine the mechanism of inhibition of the USP14 aptamers  Our results strongly indicate that the newly identified USP14 aptamers effectively inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of USP14 in vitro.We tested whether the total deubiquitinating activity of the proteasome was affected by the three USP14 aptamers. Proteasomes that were not treated with Ub-vme showed significant deubiquitinating activity, possibly from USP14 and UCH37, another proteasomal DUB that interacts with RPN13<3> (<Fig. 2G> and <Supplementary Fig. 4>). The enzymatic redundancy between these two enzymes on the proteasome is unclear, but is considered insignificant because UCH37 exhibits much weaker Ub hydrolysis activity than USP14<7>. Addition of the USP14 aptamers strongly inhibited proteasome-mediated Ub-rho110 hydrolysis (<Fig. 2G> and <Supplementary Fig. 4>). USP14-3 showed the strongest inhibitory activity for all tested proteasome concentrations. The strong inhibition exhibited by USP14-3 could be a result of its ability to simultaneously bind to UCH37 (data not shown). This would indicate that UCH37 plays a more significant role in deubiquitinating polyubiquitinated substrates than previously thought<3>. Further study is required to determine whether chain-trimming by UCH37 can suppress proteasome activity as effectively as USP14. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that USP14 RNA aptamers block the activity of USP14 and proteasomal DUBs. Our results suggest that the RNA aptamers bind to USP14 and inhibit its deubiquitinating activity. We previously reported that inhibition of USP14’s Ub-chain trimming effects might enhance the proteolytic activities of proteasomes in vitro and in vivo<7>. To explore the possibility that inhibitory USP14 aptamers might enhance proteasome activity, we used suc-LLVY-AMC, a fluorogenic reporter substrate of 26S proteasomes. The fluorescent intensity as a result of suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis gradually increased over time (<Fig. 3A> and <Supplementary Fig. 5>). Proteasomal activity was higher when the USP14 RNA aptamers were present than when control aptamers were used, indicating that inhibiting USP14 with an RNA aptamer results in facilitated proteasomal degradation. Potentially USP14 aptamers inhibit USP14 by preventing its docking on the proteasome. However, direct pulldown assays indicated that the scenario is negative (<Fig. 3B>), indicating that the inhibitory effect by the RNA aptamer is mainly on USP14’s DUB activity.We also used physiologically relevant polyubiquitinated proteins to simultaneously monitor proteolysis and Ub chain-trimming. Sic1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was polyubiquitinated using UBA1, UBC4, and RSP5 as cognate E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, respectively, along with other reconstitution components such as Ub and ATP<23>. The resulting Ub-Sic1 was gradually degraded when purified proteasomes were added. Addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 mutant protein in the reaction delayed Ub-Sic1 degradation (<Fig. 3C>). Mixing purified proteasomes with catalytically inactive recombinant USP14(C114A) facilitated the degradation of Ub-Sic1. In the control reaction, approximately 70% of Ub-Sic1 proteins were degraded by proteasomes after 10 min. However, in the presence of USP14 aptamers, Ub-Sic1 was almost completely degraded under the same conditions, showing similar kinetics for proteasomal degradation as USP14(C114A) was added in the reaction. These results suggest that USP14 aptamers function by inhibiting the catalytic activity of USP14, representing a unique biochemical and therapeutic potential for enhancing proteasome function.Dysfunction in the UPS is closely related with tau degradation and neurodegeneration in AD<28><29>. Tau proteins are thought to be degraded by the UPS, especially during the early phases of tauopathy or AD progression<30>. In the human AD brain, proteasome activity is impaired<28>, and might be related to the age-dependent decrease of proteasome activity. However, it could also be the consequence of an accumulation of tau protein. To verify that proteasome activation by USP14 aptamers facilitates tau degradation, we prepared Ub-tau. The ability of proteasomes to degrade Ub-tau was enhanced in the presence of the USP14 aptamers (<Fig. 3D,E>). These results strongly suggest that inhibition of USP14 by RNA aptamers might antagonize Ub chain-trimming on proteasomes, consequently facilitating the degradation of many UPS substrates. We investigated the effects of USP14 aptamers on HeLa cell viability. The small molecule USP14 inhibitor IU1 exhibited significant cytotoxicity at 50 μg/mL (~167 μM), while the USP14 aptamers exhibited no noticeable cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL (<Fig. 4A>). The effect of the USP14 aptamers on the proteasomal degradation of tau was examined using a HEK293-derived cell line expressing the longest isoform of human tau (htau40) upon induction with doxycycline<25>. These cells expressed htau40 in a dose-dependent manner and produced SDS-resistant tau aggregates after about 2 days in culture<31>. When USP14-3 aptamers were transfected into cells, the levels of induced tau proteins were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (<Fig. 4B>). The turnover of tau protein was facilitated by USP14-3 aptamers, as shown in our CHX chase analysis (<Fig. 4C,D>). Under those conditions, tau mRNA levels were comparable (<Fig. 4E>), indicating that accelerated tau degradation occurs post-translationally. The USP14 aptamers reduced cytotoxicity, which was induced by oxidative stress, in the presence of induced tau (<Fig. 4F>). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the protective effects of USP14 aptamers. These results indicate that USP14 aptamer-induced proteasome activation might protect cells under various stressful conditions, including neurodegeneration. Future work is necessary to determine whether the RNA aptamers we identified can delay the formation of tau aggregates in the mouse brain. We identified three RNA aptamers that specifically bind to USP14, a proteasome-associated DUB. These USP14-specific aptamers effectively inhibited deubiquitinating activity and enhanced proteasome activity in vitro. Cells treated with the aptamers showed facilitated degradation of soluble tau, delayed accumulation of tau aggregates, and enhanced cellular resistance to proteotoxic stress (<Fig. 4>). Treatment of cells with IU1 and USP14 aptamers yielded similar results, suggesting that activation of cellular proteasomes is possible through USP14 inhibition. RNA aptamers have some advantages over small molecules as therapeutic agents, and our findings suggest that USP14 aptamers could be used in the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal proteasome function.Mammalian proteasomes contain three distinct DUBs: RPN11, USP14, and UCH37. RPN11 is a metalloprotease, and a constituent component of the RP. USP14 and UCH37 are cysteine proteases that are reversibly associated with RPN1 and RPN13 respectively, their cognates on the RP. It is thought that the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN11 promotes substrate degradation, while other DUBs delay degradation. RPN11 cleaves the base of a polyUb chain and enables the substrate to enter the CP for proteolysis. USP14 and UCH37 trim Ub chains from the distal end of polyUb, thus decreasing the affinity of the chain for Ub receptors. USP14 has been reported to be capable of non-catalytically inhibiting proteasomes<32>, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this are unclear.In general, USP14 and UCH37 ensure that short or non-degradable Ub chains from substrates are released from the proteasome. The small molecule inhibitor of USP14, IU1, was identified by high-throughput screening, and found to enhance proteasomal degradation of target substrates in vitro and in vivo<7>. In vitro assays using Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau with USP14 aptamers (<Fig. 3C,D>) indicated that elevated proteasomal activity might be due to catalytically inhibiting Ub chain-trimming of the proteasome substrate."
PMC4455164_4,"The effects of USP14 aptamers on in vitro Ub degradation were more prominent when proteasomes were saturated with recombinant USP14 than when they were not  The different responses of Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau to USP14 aptamers suggests that chain-trimming may not be a universal mechanism for regulating the rate of protein turnover. The weak response of tau proteins to USP14 inhibition suggests that their Ub chains have a higher binding affinity to the 26S proteasome compared with those of Sic1<23>. The USP14 aptamers enhance proteasomal degradation; however, it remains to be determined what features of Ub substrates, or whether the geometric morphology of polyUb chains affects degradation.The in vivo stability of RNA aptamers can be improved by chemical modifications, while their biodistribution and clearance can be enhanced by conjugation with chemical moieties, such as polyethylene glycol or cholesterol. Aptamers were first reported in the early 1990s<9> and have received widespread attention as potential therapeutic agents. The aptamer GB1-10 has been shown to recognize a glioblastoma-associated tenascin-C isoform, which is a useful marker for disease activity<33>. The expression of RNA aptamers against Ku protein in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells potentially sensitized them to the anticancer drug etoposide<34>. The aptamer pegaptanib slows vision loss in people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration<35>. It has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and has been incorporated into European guidelines. Several other RNA and DNA aptamers have been developed for use in preclinical and clinical trials<19>. The USP14 aptamer could be used for modulating proteotoxic proteins in cells. The essential sequence and structure of USP14 aptamers that mediates the strong interactions with USP14 requires elucidation. This would assist in determining how these aptamers can be further truncated and modified without adversely affecting their binding activity in vivo.Enhancing proteasome activity could be a therapeutic strategy to treat diseases caused by the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cardiomyopathies. Li et al. showed that cellular proteasome levels were increased when the 11S proteasome was upregulated in cardiomyocytes. This enhanced proteasome-mediated removal of oxidized proteins, and protected cells against cardiac proteinopathy and myocardial ischemia<36><37>. In the current study, we observed that inhibiting USP14 with specific aptamers did not appear to alter proteasome levels, but alleviated tau- and paraquat-induced cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that enhanced proteasome activity can have a beneficial effect on cell viability under conditions of general proteotoxic stress. It remains to be determined whether USP14-specific RNA aptamers, or their modified forms, can accelerate the degradation of other proteopathic proteins. It was previously shown that IU1 was able to accelerate the degradation of tau, TDP43, ataxin 3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein<7>. The application of USP14 aptamers is not necessarily limited to cytoprotective roles against toxic protein accumulation. USP14 also plays an essential role in recycling Ub monomers, and in the dynamic regulation of Ub pools in cells<6><38>. Therefore, USP14 aptamers could be used to understand molecular mechanisms of USP14 activity and Ub homeostasis in cells. How to cite this article: Lee, J. H. et al.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary mechanism by which intracellular proteins, transcription factors, and many proteotoxic proteins with aggregation-prone structures are degraded. The UPS is reportedly downregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders, with increased proteasome activity shown to be beneficial in many related disease models. Proteasomes function under tonic inhibitory conditions, possibly via the ubiquitin chain-trimming function of USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). We identified three specific RNA aptamers of USP14 (USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3) that inhibited its deubiquitinating activity. The nucleotide sequences of these non-cytotoxic USP14 aptamers contained conserved GGAGG motifs, with G-rich regions upstream, and similar secondary structures. They efficiently elevated proteasomal activity, as determined by the increased degradation of small fluorogenic peptide substrates and physiological polyubiquitinated Sic1 proteins. Additionally, proteasomal degradation of tau proteins was facilitated in the presence of the UPS14 aptamers in vitro. Our results indicate that these novel inhibitory UPS14 aptamers can be used to enhance proteasome activity, and to facilitate the degradation of proteotoxic proteins, thereby protecting cells from various neurodegenerative stressors. ."
PMC2258316_0,"Aberrant phosphorylation of tau protein on serine and threonine residues has been shown to be critical in neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies. An increasing amount of data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of tau might play an equally important role in pathology, with at least three putative tyrosine kinases of tau identified to date. It was recently shown that the tyrosine kinase Syk could efficiently phosphorylate α-synuclein, the aggregated protein found in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. We report herein that Syk is also a tau kinase, phosphorylating tau in vitro and in CHO cells when both proteins are expressed exogenously. In CHO cells, we have also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Syk binds to tau. Finally, by site-directed mutagenesis substituting the tyrosine residues of tau with phenylalanine, we established that tyrosine 18 was the primary residue in tau phosphorylated by Syk. The identification of Syk as a common tyrosine kinase of both tau and α-synuclein may be of potential significance in neurodegenerative disorders and also in neuronal physiology. These results bring another clue to the intriguing overlaps between tauopathies and synucleinopathies and provide new insights into the role of Syk in neuronal physiology.

We also thank Malvyne Rolli-Derkinderen for help in the analysis of  in vitro  kinase assay and Gervaise Loirand for her constant support. Many neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by intracellular inclusions of highly insoluble proteins, and a classification based upon the main protein component of these aggregates is widely used. The term “synucleinopathies”, for instance, refers to a group of disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD) in which the synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) forms neuronal or glial aggregates <[1]>. “Tauopathies” are another pathological entity in which the microtubule-associated protein tau self-assembles into filamentous inclusions called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) <[2]>. The tauopathies include Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.Human brain tau consists of a family of six isoforms, generated by the alternative splicing of a single mRNA transcript. Tau proteins contain either three (tau 3R) or four (tau 4R) tubulin-binding domains depending on the splicing of exon 10, and either one (tau 1N) two (tau 2N) or no (tau 0N) N-terminal inserts depending on the inclusion of exon 2, exons 2 and 3, or exclusion of both, respectively. Their apparent molecular weights range from 45 kDa for tau 0N3R isoform to 65 kDa for tau 2N4R. When aggregated in NFT, tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated by a series of serine/threonine kinases, among which glycogen synthase kinase-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and casein kinase 1 appear to be the most relevant <[3,4]>. It has been hypothesized that this hyperphosphorylation contributes to neurodegeneration through the destabilisation of microtubules <[5]>.Recent data suggest that phosphorylation of tau also occurs on tyrosine residues and this could be of potential significance in pathological conditions <[6,7]>. Human tau protein possesses five tyrosine residues on positions 18, 29, 197, 310 and 394 (numbered according to the longest 2N4R tau isoform). Tau extracted from NFT of AD patients was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine 18 (Y18) by immunocytochemistry using a phosphospecific antibody <[6]>, and on tyrosine 394 (Y394) by mass spectrometry <[8]>. Tyrosine 197 (Y197) has been shown to be phosphorylated in tau aggregates from transgenic mice overexpressing mutant tau <[9]>. Recently, the dual specificity kinase tau-tubulin kinase 1 has been shown to phosphorylate tau in vitro on Y197 <[10]>. While Abl was recently described as a candidate tyrosine kinase for Y394 <[8]>, Fyn is considered to be the kinase for Y18 <[6]>.The tyrosine kinase Syk is known for its critical role in signalling through immune receptors in leucocytes <[11]>. Syk tyrosine kinase expression is however not confined to hematopoietic cells, and has been reported in a variety of tissues <[12]>. Syk expression has been confirmed in the central nervous system (CNS) by immunoblot analysis of mouse brain homogenates, and its localization in mouse neuronal cytoplasm affirmed by immunohistochemistry <[12]>. While its function in the CNS remains unclear, Syk was recently found to be a kinase for α-syn <[13]>. The direct interaction of Syk and α-syn was proven by confocal microscopy and a dual-hybrid system approach <[13]>. The intriguing overlap in the pathophysiology of synucleinopathies and tauopathies prompted us to assess whether tau protein was also a substrate for Syk tyrosine kinase <[14]>. We herein report that Syk can phosphorylate Tau on Y18, and that the kinase and its substrate directly interact.We first investigated whether Syk can directly phosphorylate tau in vitro. Recombinant human tau 2N4R was incubated with or without recombinant Syk or Abl <[8]>. Tau was phosphorylated in vitro by Syk and by its previously recognized tyrosine kinase Abl as judged on Western blots probed with P-Tyr-100 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Cell Signaling), whereas no phosphorylation was observed in experiments where tau was incubated without Syk (<Fig. 1>). In the presence of Syk, an additional band of approximately 70 kDa, migrating just above tau, was observed on the phosphotyrosine immunoblot. This band is likely to contain Syk since the kinase is known to autophosphorylate. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Syk can directly catalyze tau phosphorylation.To determine whether Syk can phosphorylate tau in cells, co-transfection experiments were performed in CHO cells using Syk expression vectors together with untagged or V5-tagged tau. Cells were lysed and tau was immunoprecipitated with either anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) or with anti-tau antibody (Tau-5, BD Biosciences). Western analysis was then performed on immunoprecipitated tau using the anti-phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-100, Cell Signaling), anti-tau (Tau-5) or anti-Syk (N-19, Santa Cruz) antibodies as previously described <[8]>. In preliminary experiments, a V5-tagged tau 2N4R construct and wild-type Syk were transiently coexpressed in CHO cells. We have previously shown that V5-tagged tau 2N4R migrates at approximately 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE <[8]>. Because of the close molecular weights of Syk (72 kDa) and the V5-tau construct, the two proteins co-migrated using conventional denaturing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). To better resolve the two proteins, we used two complementary approaches. In a first set of experiments, we expressed V5-tagged tau 2N4R along with a Syk-GFP construct that migrates at 100 kDa. The Syk-GFP construct was proven to remain functionally active in previous studies <[15]>. In a second set of experiments, we coexpressed wild-type untagged Syk along with the shortest tau isoform (0N3R), which migrates at 45 kDa. Tau protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine when co-transfected with Syk-GFP construct or with its known tyrosine kinase Abl (<Fig. 2>A). Additional positive controls included tau-transfected cells treated with the tyrosine-phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (100 μM for 30 min). When Syk-GFP was co-transfected with tau, tau immunoprecipitates contained a ∼ 100-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, likely to contain Syk-GFP since this enzyme is tyrosine phosphorylated (<Fig. 2>A). This was confirmed by blotting with Syk antibody after membrane stripping (<Fig. 2>A). This co-immunoprecipitation of Syk with tau is indicative of Syk and its substrate being in the same protein complex."
PMC2258316_1,"In order to exclude any effects of the V5 and GFP tags fused with tau and Syk, we wished to repeat this experiment using vectors expressing native proteins  The untagged and shortest isoform of tau (0N3R) was phosphorylated on tyrosine when co-transfected with native 72 kDa Syk (<Fig. 2>B), as compared with the transfection of tau alone. As in <Fig. 2>A, an additional 72-kDa band corresponding to phospho-Syk was visible on the phosphotyrosine blot when Syk was co-transfected with tau. The co-immunoprecipitation is therefore confirmed with native proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Syk tyrosine kinase can both phosphorylate and co-immunoprecipitate with tau in cells, consistent with the direct phosphorylation of the substrate demonstrated in vitro (<Fig. 1>). The binding of Syk to both the shortest and longest isoform of tau suggests that it is independent of tau splicing.Tau has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated on residue 18, 197 and 394 <[6,8–10]>. To map the tyrosine residue(s) phosphorylated by Syk in tau, Syk was co-transfected into CHO cells along with wild-type or mutant tau constructs in which individual tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanine (Y18F, Y197F and Y394F). These cDNA constructs have been described in detail previously <[8]>. The only such tyrosine mutation that resulted in a strong decrease in tau tyrosine phosphorylation was Y18F (<Fig. 3>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y197F and Y394F constructs were not significantly different from the wild-type control (<Fig. 3>). This clearly demonstrates that Y18 is the major tyrosine phosphorylation site for Syk. In addition, the binding of Syk was independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of tau (<Fig. 3>), suggesting that the SH2 domains of Syk are not involved in its binding to tau.As Fyn and Syk phosphorylate the same tyrosine residue on tau, we decided to perform a time course of phosphorylation of tau by the two kinases under conditions designed to favour the measurement of stoichiometry. After 30 min, Syk had incorporated an average of 0.23 mol of phosphate/mol of tau and Fyn had incorporated an average of 0.25 mol of phosphate/mol of tau. These results show that Syk and Fyn phosphorylate tau with the same efficacy (<Fig. 4>).Our demonstration of binding of tau to Syk is consistent with tau being a specific substrate for Syk and for their involvement in a cell-signaling pathway in neurons. Interestingly, Syk plays an important role in signalling events of neurite induction and outgrowth in neuronal cell lines <[16]>. It is thus tempting to speculate that the phosphorylation of tau by Syk could be involved in neurite outgrowth. Our study also reinforces the role of Syk in neurodegenerative disorders. Remarkably, Y18 has been shown to be phosphorylated in NFT, suggesting that, like Fyn, Syk could be critical in the pathophysiology of AD <[6,7,17]>. Although early studies suggested a clear distinction between ‘tauopathies’ and ‘synucleinopathies’, more recent studies demonstrate that there is often an overlap in the pathological findings in these disorders <[18–20]>. Syk binds to and phosphorylates both tau and synuclein, suggesting that this kinase could be a link between synucleinopathies and tauopathies. In conclusion, our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of the signaling pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation of tau in both physiological and pathological conditions. Further elucidation of the functional relationship between tau and the Syk in neurons could provide critical insights into the role of tau in cell signaling as well as the role of tau in neurodegenerative processes. rhetorical Fig. 1 Phosphorylation of tau by Syk in vitro. Recombinant tau 2N4R was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as described previously <[21]>. Recombinant human tau (2 μg) was incubated with or without 0.4 μg of Syk or Abl (Invitrogen) in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 12 mM beta-glycerophosphate and 1 mM dithiothreithiol) in the presence of 0.2 M ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Control tau was put through the same procedure but without kinase. The phosphorylation reactions were analyzed by Western blotting using 8% gels and P-Tyr-100 (Blot P-Tyr) and tau-5 (Blot Tau). The data presented are representative of three independent experiments. rhetorical Fig. 2 Phosphorylation of tau by Syk in cells. (A) CHO cells were co-transfected with 2N4R V5 tagged human tau and constructs expressing Syk-GFP (Tau + Syk-GFP), Abl (Tau + Abl) or empty vector (Tau + pEGFP-N2) as described previously. An additional positive control consisted of tau-transfected cells treated with pervanadate (Tau pervanadate). Cells were harvested after 24 h and tau was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody. Western blots on the immunoprecipitates were probed with P-Tyr-100 (IP V5, Blot P-Tyr) and with Tau-5 (IP V5, Blot Tau) or Syk N-19 (IP V5, Blot Syk) after membrane stripping. (B) CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with 0N3R untagged human tau and native human Syk (Tau 0N3R + Syk) or transfected with 0N3R tau alone (Tau 0N3R). Cells were harvested after 24 h and tau was immunoprecipitated using tau-5 antibody. Western blots on the immunoprecipitates were probed with P-Tyr-100 (IP Tau, Blot P-Tyr) and Tau-5 (IP Tau, Blot Tau). The data presented are representative of three independent experiments and were confirmed by using another phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate, data not shown). rhetorical Fig. 3 Tyr-18 is the primary site phosphorylated by Syk in transfected CHO cells. CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with Syk-GFP construct and tau (Tau + Syk-GFP) or Y18F mutant tau (Tau Y18F + Syk-GFP) or Y197F mutant tau (Tau Y197F + Syk-GFP) or Y394F mutant tau (Tau Y394F + Syk-GFP), in which tyrosine 18, 197 or 394 were replaced by phenylalanine. The constructs used were based upon tau 2N4R cDNA and were V5-tagged. Cells were harvested after 24 h and tau was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were probed with P-Tyr-100 (IPV5, Blot P-Tyr) and Tau-5 (IPV5, Blot Tau). The data presented are representative of three independent experiments and were confirmed by using another phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate, data not shown). rhetorical Fig. 4 Stoichiometry and time course of phosphate incorporation into tau following phosphorylation with Syk (solid triangles) or Fyn (open squares). Recombinant human tau (2 μg) was incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer (as in <Fig. 1>) in the presence of 0.2 M ATP and 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. Ten μl aliquots were pipetted in duplicate onto p81 Whatman papers at the indicated times as described previously <[22]>. The results are representative of two independent experiments. Aberrant phosphorylation of tau protein on serine and threonine residues has been shown to be critical in neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies. An increasing amount of data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of tau might play an equally important role in pathology, with at least three putative tyrosine kinases of tau identified to date. It was recently shown that the tyrosine kinase Syk could efficiently phosphorylate α-synuclein, the aggregated protein found in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. We report herein that Syk is also a tau kinase, phosphorylating tau in vitro and in CHO cells when both proteins are expressed exogenously. In CHO cells, we have also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Syk binds to tau. Finally, by site-directed mutagenesis substituting the tyrosine residues of tau with phenylalanine, we established that tyrosine 18 was the primary residue in tau phosphorylated by Syk. The identification of Syk as a common tyrosine kinase of both tau and α-synuclein may be of potential significance in neurodegenerative disorders and also in neuronal physiology."
