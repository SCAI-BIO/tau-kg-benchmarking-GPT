PMC5347034_0,"Tau acetylation has recently emerged as a dominant post-translational modification (PTM) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Mass spectrometry studies indicate that tau acetylation sites cluster within the microtubule (MT)-binding region (MTBR), suggesting acetylation could regulate both normal and pathological tau functions. Here, we combined biochemical and cell-based approaches to uncover a dual pathogenic mechanism mediated by tau acetylation. We show that acetylation specifically at residues K280/K281 impairs tau-mediated MT stabilization, and enhances the formation of fibrillar tau aggregates, highlighting both loss and gain of tau function. Full-length acetylation-mimic tau showed increased propensity to undergo seed-dependent aggregation, revealing a potential role for tau acetylation in the propagation of tau pathology. We also demonstrate that methylene blue, a reported tau aggregation inhibitor, modulates tau acetylation, a novel mechanism of action for this class of compounds. Our study identifies a potential “two-hit” mechanism in which tau acetylation disengages tau from MTs and also promotes tau aggregation. Thus, therapeutic approaches to limit tau K280/K281 acetylation could simultaneously restore MT stability and ameliorate tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies.

We thank Dr. Kurt Brunden (University of Pennsylvania) for kindly providing active and inactive ATPZ compounds. Tau proteins form hallmark neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and other pathological lesions that characterize Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Six tau isoforms are present in the brain containing either three (3R-tau) or four (4R-tau) repeat domains that together with the flanking regions mediate physiological tau-microtubule (MT) binding and confer MT stability<1><2>. Tau phosphorylation in regions mostly flanking the MT-binding region (MTBR) is the dominant mechanism thought to control tau function. However, tau is subject to a myriad of other post-translational modifications (PTMs) (e.g. ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, glycosylation, polyamination)<3> that alter tau’s biochemical properties, indicating that a complex tau PTM profile coordinately regulates tau function, which could ultimately determine aberrant tau pathology in diseased brains.We and others demonstrated that tau is subject to acetylation within the lysine-rich MTBR<4><5><6><7><8><9>. While the full complement of enzymes controlling tau acetylation is not well-characterized, in vitro and cell-based experiments showed that CREB-binding protein (CBP) or the highly homologous p300 acetylates tau with high affinity in the MTBR<4><8><10>. In the complete absence of CBP or p300, tau also possesses an intrinsic ability to self-acetylate similar to that observed with auto-regulated acetyltransferases (e.g. MYST-family), implying that the energetically favorable acetyl group transfer may occur if acetyl-CoA levels are present at sufficient concentrations in the cytoplasm where tau is enriched<10>. Counter-acting tau acetylation, the deacetylases HDAC6 and SIRT1 have been shown to deacetylate tau in vitro and in cultured cells, highlighting a potential neuroprotective role for tau deacetylation by HDACs/Sirtuins<4><8>.Several studies have implicated tau acetylation in the formation and maturation of NFTs<4><6><8><11><12>. Using an acetylation-specific tau antibody recognizing residue K280, tau lesions were readily detected in all 4R-tauopathies analyzed including AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and a panel of familial AD cases, but not 3R-tau predominant Pick’s disease (PD) lacking exon 10 that harbors the K280 residue<4>. Supporting a pathological role for tau acetylation, CBP-acetylated tau proteins composed solely of the MTBR (tau-K18) showed increased tau filament formation as assessed by sedimentation assays, elevated Thioflavin T (ThT) reactivity, and the formation of tau fibrils by electron microscopy (EM).The affinity for particular acetylated lysine residues or the exact stoichiometry of tau acetylation may be critical determinants of tau aggregation<5>. However, the consistent detection of K280-acetylated insoluble tau in several tau transgenic mouse models<4><13><14> and human tauopathy brain samples<4><6><11><12> supports the notion that tau K280 acetylation increasingly correlates with tau pathogenesis. More recently, tau acetylation-mimicking mutations at other prominent sites including K174, K274, K281 induced a series of AD-like deficits including synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments in viral-transduced and transgenic mouse models, supporting an acetylation-mediated pathological cascade<15><16>. A detailed understanding of how acetylation regulates tau function could foster new avenues to limit acetylated tau as plausible therapeutic strategies.Early biochemical studies showed that the positively charged tau residues K280 and K281 physically engage MTs, highlighting the double lysine containing PHF6* motif (275VQIINK/K281) in exon 10 as a hotspot for tau-MT binding in addition to promoting tau aggregation<17>. The importance of residue K280 is reflected by the genetic deletion of this residue in FTDP-17 class dementia (ΔK280)<18> or by the acetylation of residues K280 or K281, as we observed in AD and other tauopathies<4>. Either lysine deletion or acetylation is predicted to neutralize the overall positive lysine charge within this region, potentially abrogating tau-MT binding. However, in contrast to the relatively rare genetic ΔK280 mutation, positive K280-acetylated lesions are observed in most sporadic 4R-tauopathies analyzed to date<11><12> and may represent a common feature of AD and other tauopathies.Here, we provide evidence that tau K280/K281 acetylation induces pathogenic hallmarks consistent with both loss and gain of tau-mediated toxicity. Surprisingly, we show that tau acetylation alters phosphorylation at residues S202/T205 (comprising the AT8 epitope), indicating acetylation-dephosphorylation cross-talk. Using a series of biochemical approaches, we found that K280/K281 acetylation impaired tau-mediated MT assembly function and also significantly enhanced tau aggregation. Our results highlight the PHF6* double lysine motif as a critical hotspot playing a dual role in normal and pathological tau function. Therefore, modulating the acetylation machinery to limit K280/K281 acetylation could provide therapeutic benefits in AD and other tauopathies. Full-length 2N4R-tau (also referred to as tau-T40) was co-expressed in cultured QBI-293 cells in the presence of wild-type CBP or a catalytically inactive CBP mutant (harboring L1435A/D1436A mutations, referred to as CBP-LD). Surprisingly, we observed that CBP-acetylated tau led to specific loss of the slower migrating ~75 kD tau species, initially detected using total tau antibodies, which potentially reflected reduced phosphorylation mediated by tau acetylation, an effect that was not observed with CBP-LD that is unable to facilitate tau acetylation (<Fig. 1a>, <Supplementary Fig. S1>). Subsequent immunoblotting showed near complete loss of AT8 immunoreactivity as well as loss of higher mobility ~75 kDa tau bands using a series of other phospho-tau antibodies.Tau contains four prominent acetylation sites (K163, K280, K281, and K369) that were previously identified by mass spectrometry of immunopurified tau from cultured cells<4>."
PMC5347034_1,"Thus, we introduced acetylation-mimics (4KQ), non-mimics (4KR), or a double lysine deletion (ΔK280/K281), which either maintain (e g. K → R) or reduce (e.g. K → Q or ΔKK) the positive charge within this region. The tau proteins were expressed alone or in combination with a panel of enzymes that modify tau including acetyltransferases/deacetylases (CBP and HDAC6) and kinases/phosphatases (GSK3 and PP2A), and analyzed by immunoblotting (<Fig. 1b and c>, <Supplementary Fig. S1>). Similar to CBP-acetylated tau, acetylationmimic tau at either K280/K281 (2KQ) or all four lysines (4KQ), or surprisingly deletion of K280/K281 altogether (ΔKK), caused similar loss of S202/T205 phosphorylation (<Fig. 1b and c>). Supporting the involvement of PP2A phosphatases in acetylation-induced dephosphorylation, over-expression of a PP2A targeting subunit (PP2A-B56α) led to S202/T205 dephosphorylation (<Fig. 1b>), while the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) restored S202/T205 immunoreactivity in cells expressing either ΔKK, 2KQ, or 4KQ mutants (<Fig. 1c>). Thus, either loss of the K280/K281 positive charge or their neutralization via acetylation is sufficient to promote dephosphorylation at the AT8 epitope.To evaluate whether tau acetylation reduced AT8 immunoreactivity in neurons, we generated GFP-tagged versions of WT tau-T40 (WT-tau-GFP) or the 4KQ acetylation-mimic (4KQ-tau-GFP). As shown in <Fig. 1d>, WT tau expression in primary cortical neurons is pan-neuronal while AT8 immunoreactivity is predominantly restricted to the proximal axonal and somato-dendritic compartments, as previously noted<19>, likely reflecting enhanced PP2A activity in more distal regions of the axonal compartment. In contrast, expression of the acetylation-mimic 4KQ-tau showed reduced AT8-positive immunoreactivity, including within the somato-dendritic compartment of 4KQ-tau-GFP transfected neurons (<Fig. 1d>, see arrows). Thus, tau acetylation within the MTBR modulates distant tau phosphorylation status, potentially by generating a MT-dissociated cytosolic tau pool that is more susceptible to PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation. To evaluate whether tau acetylation leads to MT dissociation, we sought to examine downstream functional consequences on MT-assembly and pathological tau aggregation. Tau residues K280 and K281 within the PHF6* double lysine motif were shown to directly contact and stabilize charge interactions between tau and MTs<17>. Therefore, we hypothesized that K280/K281 acetylation, and hence neutralization of this positive charge, would impair MT stabilizing activity, leading to cytosolic accumulation and loss of normal tau function. First, we assessed whether both lysines K280 and K281 could be subject to acetylation by mass spectrometry analysis of CBP-acetylated full-length tau-T40 from cultured cells<4>. Indeed, in addition to singly acetylated peptides, we identified a prominent tryptic tau peptide in which K280/K281 were doubly acetylated, suggesting that K280/K281 are subject to either individual or tandem acetylation (<Fig. 2a> and <Supplementary Fig. S2>). In vitro acetylation reactions using radiolabeled [14C]-acetyl-CoA showed that the 3R-tau repeat domain (tau-K19), which lacks the 2nd MTBR repeat containing residues K280/K281, or the 4R-tau repeat domain (tau-K18) containing a deletion of K280/K281 (referred to as ΔKK) led to slightly reduced overall tau acetylation levels (<Fig. 2b and c>, <Supplementary Fig. S3>), highlighting the K280/K281 residues as two of the more prominent acceptor sites among the >20 tau lysines that are subject to acetylation in vitro.To further assess tau-MT regulation, we examined whether acetylation-mimic or non-mimic mutations at K280/K281, either singly or in combination, could alter MT assembly function. Tubulin polymerization reactions were performed using recombinant WT tau-K18 or K280/K281 mutants containing acetylation-mimic (K → Q) or non-mimic (K → R) mutations and MT assembly was assessed by optical density (O.D) readings (<Fig. 2d>)<20>. As expected, WT tau promoted tubulin assembly into polymerized MTs. In contrast, the single K280Q mutation impaired tau-mediated MT assembly by ~50%, while the double K280/281Q mutant showed near complete abrogation of MT assembly activity to baseline levels, similar to assembly reactions lacking tau altogether (<Fig. 2d>). Notably, the non-mimics containing single K280R or double 2KR mutations, which maintain the positive charge at residues K280/K281, showed either no effect or a mild enhancement of MT assembly kinetics (<Fig. 2e>). These results indicate that acetylation-mimics induce charge neutralization at K280/K281 and impair tau-mediated stabilization of MTs. Given that acetylated tau is detected within NFTs in AD brain<4><11><12>, we next investigated whether acetylation might promote tau aggregation, as our previous study using CBP-acetylated tau suggested that fully acetylated tau induced tau aggregation in vitro<4>, however, the critical residues mediating this effect remained unclear. In vitro heparin-induced sedimentation assays were performed using acetylation-mimic and non-mimic tau proteins as well as the aggregate-prone familial P301L mutant. WT and K280R non-mimic tau-K18 proteins transitioned to the pellet fraction by 8 h. Strikingly, the K280Q mutant showed remarkably accelerated sedimentation kinetics and was near ~100% pelleted by 1 hr, an effect that was similarly observed with the positive control P301L mutant (<Fig. 3a>, <Supplementary Fig. S4>). Consistent with the sedimentation results, ThT fluorescence measurements detected robust tau aggregation that was ~5–6 fold higher for K280Q and P301L proteins at 1 h and remained elevated for the duration of the 8 h incubation period (<Fig. 3b>). The single K280Q and double K280/K281Q mutants showed comparable in vitro aggregation kinetics within this accelerated 0–1 h time-frame (data not shown). These results were further evaluated using full-length tau-T40 proteins containing single K280Q acetylation-mimic or P301L mutations. We observed enhanced transition to the pellet fraction for T40-K280Q and T40-P301L by 1 d (<Fig. 3c>, <Supplementary Fig. S4>), which was further corroborated by ThT fluorescence (<Fig. 3d>). Thus, K → Q substitutions within the critical PHF6* motif, in the apparent absence of other tau PTMs, appears sufficient to accelerate tau aggregation in vitro.Negative staining electron microscopy (EM) was performed to visualize fibril formation of WT, K280Q, and P301L tau-K18 at various time-points (<Fig. 4>). After 2 h incubation, only sparse WT fibrils were detected, in agreement with slower kinetic rates of aggregation. In contrast, numerous dense networks of mutant K280Q and P301L fibrils were observed after 2 h incubation, consistent with the accelerated sedimentation and ThT analysis for these two mutants. Furthermore, even after 4 h incubation, WT fibrils were not abundant, while the K280Q and P301L mutants continued to accumulate robust negatively stained filaments (<Fig. 4>). We were unable to detect robust K280R fibrils at any early time points, consistent with delayed aggregation kinetics.Since tau K280 acetylation is associated with amyloid tau pathology, we sought to further characterize the biochemical properties of aggregate-prone K280Q fibrils. Circular dichroism (CD) was employed to assess whether K280Q fibrils contained anti-parallel β-sheet structure, which strongly correlates with tau aggregation. As shown in <Fig. 5>, K280Q and P301L fibrils incubated for only 1 h showed the strongest shift in absorbance from random coil structure to β-sheet structure, as determined by the peak broadening observed at ~218 nm, a conformational transition previously noted for aggregate-prone tau fibrils and indicative of tau amyloid structure in vivo<21><22>. While WT fibrils displayed some detectable β-structure at the 1 h time-point, we note that the amyloid conversion for both WT and, more prominently, the K280R fibrils was reduced when compared to aggregate-prone K280Q or P301L mutants, also consistent with their delayed aggregation kinetics."
PMC5347034_2,"Fibrillar tau seeds promote the rapid appearance of K280-acetylated tau in mice<13><23>  We therefore tested whether expression of full-length tau containing acetylation-mimics, T40-2KQ (K280/281Q), was susceptible to seed-dependent tau aggregation in a cell-based assay. K18-P301L seeds were packaged and delivered into cultured QBI-293 cells ectopically expressing full-length tau-T40 (WT, P301L, 2KQ, or 2KR) and seeded tau pathology was assessed by immunoblotting of soluble and insoluble fractions. As expected, full-length T40-P301L partly accumulated in the insoluble fraction and was detectable with a panel of phospho-tau and acetyl-tau (ac-K280) antibodies (<Fig. 6a and b>, <Supplementary Fig. S5>). Similar to T40-P301L, full-length T40-2KQ also showed increased aggregation upon seeding and accumulated in the insoluble fraction, as detected with a total tau antibody (K9JA). In contrast, the T40-2KR non-mimic mutant was not significantly aggregated and behaved similarly to WT. Interestingly, unlike T40-P301L, which was hyper-phosphorylated at all epitopes examined, the insoluble T40-2KQ pool did not show robust phospho-tau immunoreactivity, indicating that tau hyper-phosphorylation does not necessarily correlate with insoluble tau seeding (<Fig. 6b> and <Supplementary Fig. S5>). Thus, acetylation-mimic tau mutations at residues K280/K281 are capable of enhancing the seed-dependent aggregation of full-length tau. Given that the acetylation-mimics enhanced tau aggregation, we searched for compounds that might inhibit this process. Methylene blue (MB) and its derivatives are a class of anti-tau aggregation compounds, but their mechanism of action is not fully understood<24><25><26><27><28><29><30><31>. We tested whether MB inhibited WT and K280Q tau aggregation in vitro. Tau proteins were pre-incubated with MB prior to the initiation of fibril reactions. Consistent with previous reports, MB inhibited WT tau-K18 fibrillization as indicated by the delayed appearance of ~15 kDa tau-K18 in the fibrillar pellet fraction (<Fig. 7a>, left, <Supplementary Fig. S6>)<26>. Although K280Q showed accelerated fibril formation at 30 min, MB pre-treatment was also sufficient to partially delay K280Q aggregation at this time point, but was much less effective at 2 h, a time point at which K280Q had more fully transitioned to the fibrillar pellet fraction (<Fig. 7a>, right, <Supplementary Fig. S6>). The appearance of a ~30 kDa tau dimer was also observed in the presence of MB, consistent with its reported cysteine oxidizing properties<26>.To assess the effects of MB on tau in cultured cells, we employed a previously described pharmacological strategy combining autophagy inhibition using 3-methyladenine (3MA) and exposure to the oxidative stressor sodium arsenite (Ars), which together stabilize the accumulation of aberrantly modified tau<10>. K18-WT, and more prominently K18-K280Q, accumulated in the soluble and also partially in the insoluble fractions in response to 3MA and Ars, and their levels were suppressed by co-incubation with MB (<Fig. 7b and c>, <Supplementary Fig. S6>). Further implicating aberrant tau PTMs in this process, K18-P301L expressing cells showed increased K280 acetylation and S262 phosphorylation within the MTBR, and these were also suppressed by co-incubation with MB (<Supplementary Fig. S6>). Thus, MB is sufficient to reduce aberrantly modified tau species in a cell-based assay, although we note that MB has broad pleiotropic effects in the cell that could also influence tau including regulation of tau kinases and caspases<32><33>.Given the absence of ectopically expressed acetyltransferases in this cell-based assay, we hypothesized that MB may act, in part, by chemically interfering with endogenous tau acetylation, thereby decreasing aberrantly acetylated tau species and preventing their accumulation. Tau auto-acetylation was recently reported to occur in a cysteine-dependent manner in the complete absence of CBP/p300, in which acetyl-CoA reactive tau cysteines facilitate intrinsic tau acetylation on lysines<7><10><34>. Since MB is known to interact with tau cysteines<24><26>, we tested whether MB inhibits tau auto-acetylation using an in vitro radiolabeling assay (<Supplementary Fig. S6>). Inhibition of tau auto-acetylation was not observed with inactive control compounds. However, pre-incubation of K18-P301L with either MB or aminothienopyridazines (ATPZs), both of which are proposed to bind tau cysteines and promote their oxidation<26>, was sufficient to partially inhibit tau auto-acetylation (<Supplementary Fig. S6>). These results suggest that MB and related cysteine-interacting compounds could act, in part, via inhibition of tau auto-acetylation activity. In this study, we provide evidence that acetylation at residues K280/K281 is critical for normal and pathological tau functions. Site-specific tau acetylation was sufficient to alter the tau post-translational profile, impair tau-mediated MT stability, and accelerate tau aggregation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that acetylated full-length tau is more susceptible to seed-dependent tau aggregation, implicating tau acetylation in the pathogenic cascade leading to tau pathology. These results warrant future efforts to target tau acetylation as a means to restore the stabilization of MTs, a process that is perturbed during the progression of AD and related tauopathies.The identification of K280-acetylated tau in tauopathy brains initially presented a paradox regarding the significance of this residue in neurodegeneration. How can both acetylation of K280, detected in AD and related 4R-tauopathies, and the genetic deletion of the same residue, ΔK280 seen in FTDP-17 patients, both be mechanistically linked to tauopathy. Given the critical role for residues K280/K281 in mediating MT interactions<17><35><36><37><38>, we propose that either acetylation-induced charge neutralization or complete deletion of lysines altogether yield comparable phenotypic consequences in reducing the positive charge and therefore the affinity of tau for MTs, thereby facilitating the accumulation of cytosolic tau aggregates. Indeed, either K → Q substitutions, expression of the acetyltransferase CBP/p300, or deletion of K280/K281 altogether (i.e. ΔK280/281) led to similar compensatory tau dephosphorylation (<Fig. 1>) and loss of MT-stabilizing functions (<Fig. 2>). Thus, it is intriguing that a lysine PTM phenocopies a genetic lesion (e.g. ΔK280), providing a plausible explanation for how WT tau could become aggregated in the vast majority of sporadic tauopathies including AD. In fact, all 4R-tauopathies analyzed to date have shown some degree of tau K280 acetylation, which correlated most significantly with Thioflavin-positive mature NFTs in AD brains<11><12>. Importantly, however, unlike genetic tau mutations, abnormal tau PTMs such as acetylation provide a modifiable target for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, enhancement of deacetylase activity (e.g. HDAC6 or SIRT1)<4><8><39> or inhibition of acetyltransferase activity (e.g. CBP/p300 or auto-acetyltransferase activity)<4><8><10><15> could potentially alleviate tau aggregation and enhance normal tau functions. In this regard, the recent identification of salsalate as CBP/p300 inhibitor targeting tau K174 acetylation may also be effective at reducing K280 acetylation levels<15>. Future studies could evaluate whether any known or emerging CBP/p300 inhibitors modulate K280/K281 acetylation.In addition to CBP/p300, which is predominantly a nuclear enzyme involved in transcription and gene expression, our previous work suggested an intrinsic tau auto-acetylation activity capable of mediating tau self-acetylation via acetyl-CoA reactive cysteine residues<10><34><40>. Although the extent of tau auto-acetylation that occurs in vivo is not known, we speculate that a dedicated tau acetyltransferase may not be necessary to sustain increased tau acetylation in AD brain. Recent studies support the notion that physiological concentrations of acetyl-CoA cofactor alone could facilitate acetylation of cytoplasmic substrates<41><42><43>."
PMC5347034_3,"Our results in vitro and in cell-based assays showed that MB or ATPZs, compounds that reportedly promote cysteine oxidation and prevent tau aggregation, may also impair tau auto-acetylation  While we cannot rule out the contribution of other yet-to-be-identified tau acetyltransferases, our study suggests that cysteine oxidizing compounds might directly interfere with tau’s intrinsic cysteine-dependent acetyl group transfer, thereby modulating tau aggregation. Therefore, we speculate that any neuroprotective effects of MB and/or its derivatives could arise, in part, from their inhibition of tau acetylation in vivo. If so, future drug discovery efforts to identify compounds that selectively target tau cysteines may represent viable approaches to prevent tau acetylation and limit the accumulation of tau pathology.Given the complex post-translational regulation of tau by a variety of PTMs, we investigated potential cross-talk between acetylated tau and known pathological phospho-tau epitopes. Surprisingly, we found that tau acetylation led to its dephosphorylation at the AT8 epitope via PP2A phosphatase activity (<Fig. 1>). Elevated phosphatase activity likely acts in a compensatory manner to re-initiate tau-MT binding and/or prevent phospho-tau accumulation. The acetylation-induced dephosphorylation at AT8 is consistent with previous reports that AT8 is a high affinity and preferred PP2A target site<44><45><46>. Interestingly, a transient reduction in AT8 immunoreactivity has been noted in a tau transgenic animal model<47>, indicating that fluctuations and/or dephosphorylation at the AT8 epitope could represent an intermediate step prior to subsequent pathological modifications. Since PP2A activity is impaired with AD progression<48><49>, AT8 might eventually re-emerge at later stages of disease progression characterized by tau hyper-phosphorylation and aggregation. Supporting this possibility, transient AT8 reduction and recovery has been observed in cell culture models challenged with oxidative or cytoskeletal damaging agents<50><51>. More recently, phosphorylation of one residue comprising the AT8 epitope (T205) was shown to be neuroprotective in response to excitotoxicity, suggesting that acetylation could promote toxicity by reducing T205 phosphorylation<52>. The complex relationship between tau acetylation and phosphorylation highlights an incomplete understanding of dynamic tau PTMs, and therefore global tau PTM analysis, as opposed to specific tau epitopes of interest, may provide more accurate predictors of tau pathogenesis.Two prior observations hint at an involvement of tau acetylation in prion-like tau propagation. First, in both cell-based<8> and tau transgenic mouse models<4>, increased Aβ levels were sufficient to induce tau acetylation, which could facilitate tau spreading into higher neocortical brain regions. Secondly, injection of recombinant tau fibrils into the hippocampus of PS19 mice led to intracellular tau acetylation within two weeks post-injection of fibrils<13>, an unexpected observation that may be linked to subsequent tau propagation in vivo. Here, full-length tau containing K280/K281 acetylation-mimics (T40-2KQ) showed enhanced seed-dependent tau aggregation (<Fig. 6>). Since tau proteins are highly acetylated in AD brain, but not mutated in AD, it is conceivable that K280/K281 acetylated tau may better reflect the pathogenic tau species capable of initial aggregation and subsequent propagation in a spatiotemporal manner through the brain. More detailed biochemical analysis of the PTMs present on tau oligomers or other potentially transmissible tau species are necessary to further establish a causal link between acetylation and tau propagation.In summary, our study highlights tau acetylation as a critical pathogenic mechanism that may confer both loss and gain of function toxicity in AD and related tauopathies. Given the central location of acetylated lysine clusters within the MTBR, we propose that acetylation, particularly at residues K280/K281 as well as other lysines that physically engage MTs, mediates loss of MT-regulatory function and gain of abnormal tau aggregation in sporadic tauopathies including AD. Since tau contains many lysines that are subject to acetylation, future approaches that merge genetic, biochemical, neuropathological, and physiological techniques will collectively be required to dissect this complex tau PTM code. These insights are essential to devise new therapeutic strategies designed to selectively modify specific tau PTMs in AD patients. Two versions of human tau were used in this study. Most experiments used the full-length tau isoform containing both N-terminal inserts and all four repeat domains (2N4R-tau also designated tau-T40). The impact of MB and ATPZs used a fragment of tau comprising only the four repeat domains (designated tau-K18). All tau-T40 and tau-K18 plasmids were cloned into the pCDNA5/TO vector (Life Technologies). The ΔKK, K → Q, K → R, and P → L tau mutations were created using site-directed mutagenesis (NEB). In the tau-T40 and enzyme co-transfection experiments, the following enzyme plasmids were used: CBP WT, CBP LD, (CBP L1435A/D1436A), and HDAC6 (generous gifts from Tso-Pang Yao, Duke University, Durham, NC); GSK3 (generous gift from Virginia M.-Y. Lee, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA); and PP2A (PP2A-B56 α subunit, Addgene plasmid #14532). QBI-293 cells were grown in full DMEM media (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1X L-glutamine, and 1X penicillin/streptomycin), and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Promega) was used to perform the QBI-293 cell transfections. For OA treatment, QBI-293 cells transfected with tau-T40 plasmids were treated with 25 nM OA for 16 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS] supplemented with deacetylase, phosphatase and protease inhibitors as follows: 2 μM Trichostatin A (TSA), 10 mM Nicotinamide (NCA), 1 mM sodium fluoride (NaF); 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4); 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); and protease inhibitor cocktail composed of L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl, N-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, pepstatin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, each at 1 μg/ml). The samples were sonicated 20 times and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and supernatants were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the University of North Carolina (UNC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The animal protocol was approved by the UNC IACUC Committee (ID# Number: 14.107.0). Primary cortical neurons were cultured from E16 CD1 mouse embryos (Charles River) and were plated onto poly-D-lysine coated coverslips. Neuron transfection of 1 μg of tau-GFP pCDNA was performed using CalPhos™ Mammalian Transfection Kit in accordance with manufacturer instructions (Clontech). Fixation was accomplished by incubating the coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and cells were permeabilized by exposing coverslips to a 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS solution for 8 min to permeabilize the cells. Blocking was performed for 1 h at least an hour at room temperature in a solution of 2% milk in TBS containing 0.5% Triton. Following blocking, coverslips were then incubated in primary antibody, AT8 (1:1000), overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by staining with an Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated secondary antibody and counterstaining with DAPI. NanoLC nanospray MS-MS analysis was performed at the University of Pennsylvania proteomics core facility, as previously described<4>. Briefly, QBI-293 cells were co-transfected with tau-T40 WT and CBP and tau was immunoprecipitated with T14/T46 antibodies. After separating tau via SDS-PAGE, gel bands were excised and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis using LTQ XL* Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Data was acquired using Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed using Mascot, Scaffold, and PEAKS software programs."
PMC5347034_4,"Unambiguously acetylated peptides were determined by significant 10logP scores >30 and mass accuracy scores <1 0 ppm. Protein expression, extraction, and purification was performed using chromatography methodology to purify heat stable tau proteins. Tau-K18 and tau-T40 plasmids were cloned into the pRK172 bacterial expression vector for inducible protein expression. Protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) RIL E. coli cells. Bacteria were grown in lysogeny broth, ampicillin was added, and when an OD of 1.0 was reached, protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1.0 mM. After continued growth for 2 h, bacterial cultures were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min, and pellets were immediately frozen at −80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in a high salt RAB buffer, pH 7.0 (0.1 M MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 750 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail). This resuspension was homogenized, boiled, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant, with addition of 0.1 mM PMSF and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail, was dialyzed against FPLC buffer, pH 6.5 [20 mM piperazine-N,N’-bis(ethanesulfonic acid), 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM PMSF and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)]. After overnight dialysis, the contents were passed through a HiTrap sulfopropyl sepharose high performance cation exchange column (GE) attached to an ÄKTA Pure chromatography system equilibrated in FLPC buffer. Fractions were eluted over a 0–0.4 M NaCl gradient. Portions of the fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Fractions containing tau protein were subsequently pooled. The FPLC buffer present in pooled tau protein fractions was exchanged for 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 7.0), and protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Resultant protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce). For sedimentation analysis, Thioflavin T, and negative stain electron microscopy, a concentration of 10 μM tau-K18 was incubated without agitation at 37 °C with 10 μM heparin (Sigma) and 2 mM DTT in a 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0). In the MB sedimentation experiments, a fibril reaction mixture with 10 μM tau-K18 and 50 μM MB (Sigma) was held on ice for 15 minutes prior to adding heparin to a final concentration of 10 μM. Tau-T40 incubations were performed in a similar fashion, but used 15 μM tau-T40/15 μM heparin and were agitated at 37 °C. Fibril reactions for circular dichroism and cell seeding assay used 20 μM tau-K18/20 μM heparin. Tau fibril reactions were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to separate supernatant and pellet fractions. The pellet fraction was resuspended in 1X loading buffer and 100 mM DTT and an equal mass of supernatant was mixed with 6X loading buffer and 100 mM DTT. Equal mass supernatant and pellet fractions for various reaction times were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining to detect tau protein. The ThT signal of tau-K18 and tau-T40 fibril reactions at various reaction times was measured at 430 nm (excitation) and 500 nm (emission) in a 10 μM ThT solution using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Germany). Into each well, 15 µl of protein and 150 µl of 10 µM ThT solution was added. The plate was shaken briefly in the plate reader, and then the measurements were performed. For EM experiments, 5 μL of 10 μM tau-K18 fibril reactions were placed on 400 mesh Formvar/Carbon film-coated copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.) for 5 min, quickly washed with distilled water two times, and then stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 sec. A LEO EM910 transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV was used to visualize the fibrils. The camera used was an Orius SC1000 CCD Camera, 2672 × 4008 pixels (11 megapixels) and Digital Micrograph version 2.3 software was used to acquire the images (Gatan, Inc.). A minimum of N = 10 independent regions of each grid was imaged from N = 3 independent replicates of WT, K280Q, or P301L mutant fibrils. Measurements for CD were performed with a ChirascanTM circular dichroism spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd, United Kingdom) using a cuvette with a 0.10 cm path length. CD data was collected from 190 nm to 250 nm at 0.5 nm intervals. For the 0 h time point, 20 μM of the tau-K18 monomer in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer was dialyzed overnight against the CD buffer [10 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM potassium fluoride pH 7.0]. For 1 h time point, CD spectra were generated using 20 μM tau fibril reaction pellet fractions resuspended in CD buffer. Tubulin polymerization at 37 °C was monitored via absorbance readings at 350 nm using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Germany). Polymerization reactions contained 2 mM GTP (Sigma), 55 μM purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton), and 40 μM purified tau-K18 protein (or no tau in case of control). The reactions were carried out in PEM buffer [80 mM piperazine-N,N’-bis(ethanesulfonic acid) pH 6.9, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2 hexahydrate]. Absorbance data was collected at 1 min intervals for 45 min. QBI-293 cells transfected with tau-K18 WT, K280Q, or P301L were treated with 10 μM MB before and after treatment with 10 mM 3-methyladenine (3MA) and 40 μM sodium arsenite (Ars). After overnight treatment with MB, 3MA and Ars, the cells were lysed on ice and sequential extraction was performed. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS] supplemented with deacetylase, phosphatase and protease inhibitors (2 μM TSA, 10 mM NCA, 1 mM NaF; 1 mM Na3VO4; 1 mM PMSF; and protease inhibitor cocktail). The samples were sonicated 20 times and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Another extraction was performed on the pellet fraction using urea buffer [7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mM Tris pH 8.5] supplemented with the same deacetylase, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors as the RIPA buffer. The samples were sonicated 10 times and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. For radiolabeling experiments, total tau proteins (1 μg total protein) were acetylated by incubation in 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 nCi [14C]-labeled acetyl-CoA acetyl-CoA) for 1 h at 37 °C. Acetylation reactions were pre-incubated for 10 min with 20 μM MB or active/inactive ATPZ compounds, which were kindly provided by Dr. Kurt Brunden (University of Pennsylvania). QBI-293 cells transfected with indicated tau-T40 plasmids were transduced with tau-K18-PL fibrils or no fibril control. Each fibril treated well of the 6-well plate received 6 μg of tau-K18-PL fibrils. Fibrils treatments were prepared by resuspending pellets from tau-K18-PL fibril reactions in OptiMEM and then sonicating this mixture 30 times. No fibril controls were OptiMEM alone. The sonicated fibrils (or no fibril controls) were then added to OptiMEM plus Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and allowed to stand for 20 min at room temperature. This fibril-Lipofectamine mixture was added to the transfected cells. After an overnight incubation, cell culture media was replaced with fresh, full DMEM media. Cells were lysed 44–48 h after fibril addition. They were harvested on ice into Triton X-100 lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.6] supplemented with deacetylase, phosphatase and protease inhibitors [3 μM TSA, 10 mM NCA, 1 mM NaF; 1 mM Na3VO4; 1 mM PMSF; and protease inhibitor cocktail]. The samples were sonicated 30 times and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was reserved as the Triton-soluble fraction. A second Triton X-100 extraction was performed on the pellet using the same parameters as the first Triton X-100 extraction. The last extraction of the pellet was performed using SDS lysis buffer [1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7."
PMC5347034_5,"6] supplemented with the same deacetylase, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors as the Triton X-100 lysis buffer  The samples were sonicated 30 times and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting supernatant was reserved as the Triton-insoluble SDS fraction. Cell lysates were resolved via SDS-PAGE (on 10% gels for tau-T40 and 15% gels for tau-K18), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad), and blocked with 2% milk in 1X TBS for 30 min. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 1 h room temperature incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000).

Tau acetylation has recently emerged as a dominant post-translational modification (PTM) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Mass spectrometry studies indicate that tau acetylation sites cluster within the microtubule (MT)-binding region (MTBR), suggesting acetylation could regulate both normal and pathological tau functions. Here, we combined biochemical and cell-based approaches to uncover a dual pathogenic mechanism mediated by tau acetylation. We show that acetylation specifically at residues K280/K281 impairs tau-mediated MT stabilization, and enhances the formation of fibrillar tau aggregates, highlighting both loss and gain of tau function. Full-length acetylation-mimic tau showed increased propensity to undergo seed-dependent aggregation, revealing a potential role for tau acetylation in the propagation of tau pathology. We also demonstrate that methylene blue, a reported tau aggregation inhibitor, modulates tau acetylation, a novel mechanism of action for this class of compounds. Our study identifies a potential “two-hit” mechanism in which tau acetylation disengages tau from MTs and also promotes tau aggregation. Thus, therapeutic approaches to limit tau K280/K281 acetylation could simultaneously restore MT stability and ameliorate tau pathology in AD and related tauopathies. ."
PMC3759803_0,"One of the defining pathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the intraneuronal accumulation of tau. The tau that forms these accumulations is altered both posttranslationally and conformationally, and there is now significant evidence that soluble forms of these modified tau species are the toxic entities rather than the insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. However there is still noteworthy debate concerning which specific pathological forms of tau are the contributors to neuronal dysfunction and death in AD. Given that increases in aberrant forms of tau play a role in the neurodegeneration process in AD, there is growing interest in understanding the degradative pathways that remove tau from the cell, and the selectivity of these different pathways for various forms of tau. Indeed, one can speculate that deficits in a pathway that selectively removes certain pathological forms of tau could play a pivotal role in AD. In this review we will discuss the different proteolytic and degradative machineries that may be involved in removing tau from the cell. How deficits in these different degradative pathways may contribute to abnormal accumulation of tau in AD will also be considered. In addition, the issue of the selective targeting of specific tau species to a given degradative pathway for clearance from the cell will be addressed. Work from the authors’ laboratory was supported by NIH grants NS076789 (Gail V. W. Johnson) and ES020081 (Adrianne S. Chesser). The authors would like to thank Dr. Soner Gundemir for his critical reading of the manuscript. Insoluble, fibrillar intraneuronal accumulations of pathological forms of the tau protein called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are important and defining hallmarks of the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. Indeed, the progression of AD can be neuropathologically staged based on the location and extent of tau pathology (<1>). The predominant post-translational modification of tau in the NFTs is phosphorylation; however numerous modifications have been noted including truncation, acetylation, nitration, and several others (<2>–<4>). Historically the NFTs were considered to be the toxic entities, however over the past decade a new conceptual framework has developed in which pathologically modified monomeric and/or soluble oligomeric forms of tau are considered to be the harmful species (<5>, <6>). Nevertheless, determining exactly which forms of tau compromise neuronal function is still an area of significant investigation. Even though the modifications of tau that are the primary contributors to toxicity have not been conclusively determined, it is clear that tau plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of AD. Given that in animal models of AD reducing tau levels attenuates neuronal dysfunction (<7>, <8>), and in humans the extent of tau pathology correlates with cognitive decline (<9>), there is a growing interest in defining the degradative pathways that remove tau from the cell. Also of importance is understanding the role of non-degradative cleavage in influencing the eventual clearance of tau. Numerous proteases have been shown to proteolyze tau including aminopeptidases (<10>–<12>), thrombin (<13>–<15>), human high temperature requirement serine protease A1 (HTRA1) (<16>), calpain (<17>–<20>), and caspases (<21>–<24>). Overall, however, most of these enzymes do not appear to be principally responsible for tau clearance. Instead, they are able to generate modified tau species which may then contribute to developing tau pathology, enhanced tau clearance, or both. The bulk of clearance of both physiological and pathological forms of tau is instead mediated by the proteasomal and autophagic degradative systems (<25>). The contribution of each of these pathways in the turnover of tau, and which forms of tau – including various proteolytic forms – are degraded by each pathway, is an area of significant interest. Our understanding of this issue to date will be reviewed below, and the role of tau proteolysis on subsequent degradation will be discussed. Delineating how these pathways may be compromised in AD and how this contributes to tau pathology is of great importance and could have significance for informing new therapeutic approaches. Tau is a cytosolic, dynamically regulated protein. In differentiated PC12 cells, a pulse-chase experiment showed that ∼90% of the tau was degraded in 18 h (<26>). Normal, monomeric tau is likely a proteasomal substrate. However, there is evidence that tau is also a substrate for a wide range of proteases as indicated above. This is significant as tau proteolysis could be beneficial in disease by helping to enhance removal of abnormal tau from the cell. Alternately, it could be detrimental by generating toxic fragments. Below we will discuss the different proteases that have been shown to act on tau, at least in vitro, and the possible involvement of these proteolytic events in AD. Aminopeptidases are a group of enzymes that cleave from the N-terminal end of a protein. The family includes alanyl, arginyl, and glutamyl peptidases. Puromycin sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) is an alanyl peptidase that is responsible for ∼90% of the aminopeptidase activity in the brain (<10>). PSA was identified as a potential player in tau pathology through a microarray analysis of gene expression in disease-vulnerable vs. disease-resistant brain regions in JNPL3 mice that overexpress a mutant form of tau (P301L) found in the disease frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). These mice develop neurodegeneration in the cortex while the cerebellum is relatively spared [although in the original description of these animals pathology was found in the deep cerebellar nuclei (<27>)]. Interestingly, PSA was found to be elevated in the cerebellum of these TAUP301L mice (<10>). The levels of PSA are also higher in human cerebellum compared to cortex in both controls and FTD cases. A slight elevation in PSA was also observed in FTD cortices compared to controls. In addition, a non-functional PSA mutant exacerbated tau pathology in a Drosophila model of tauopathy, while overexpressing PSA ameliorated the tau phenotype and diminished tau levels (<10>). Overexpressing PSA had a similar effect in the TAUP301L mice, reducing the pathologic phenotype (delaying paralysis, increasing motor neuron density in the spinal cord, decreasing gliosis) and decreasing tau levels (<12>). PSA was able to cleave recombinant tau in vitro, as well as tau from control human brain (<11>). However, the data presented in this study suggest that PSA is cleaving tau from both the C- and N-terminal ends, which is not expected from an aminopeptidase. Additionally, other studies failed to demonstrate tau cleavage by PSA (<28>, <29>). One explanation for these discrepancies may be the limitations of in vitro assays and experimental techniques. For example, the FTDP-17 mutant tau used in many studies, while relevant for human tauopathy, is not found in AD. Additionally, this form of tau may be processed differently than tau without this mutation. For example, it has been shown that the isomerase Pin1, which has been implicated in AD (<30>), had opposite effects on P301L and wild-type tau degradation (<31>). An alternative explanation for the effects of PSA may be that PSA is indirectly regulating tau degradation. PSA has been shown to be involved in the induction of autophagy and specifically the formation of autophagosomes, in a model of overexpressed mutant huntingtin (<32>). Thus, the in vivo effects of PSA on promoting tau clearance may relate to its ability to modulate the key clearance pathway for abnormal and aggregated proteins (to be described in more detail below). Thrombin is a serine protease that is a well characterized component of the coagulation cascade. It is typically produced and secreted by endothelial cells, including those in the brain in response to hemodynamic injury. Thrombin may be inappropriately expressed in AD brain. A recent study showed that thrombin is elevated in microvessels isolated from AD brain compared to microvessels from control brain (<33>)."
PMC3759803_1,"Additionally, thrombin was present in the CSF of AD patients but not in that of controls (<33>)  This is important, as thrombin can act as a neurotoxin by activating intracellular signaling cascades causing neurite retraction and stimulating apoptosis (<34>–<36>). Thrombin may also be influencing tau pathology, as treatment of immortalized hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22 cells) with thrombin resulted in the formation of thioflavin-S positive tau aggregates within 24 h, followed by an increase in cell death at 72 h (<37>). It is unclear how this exogenously applied thrombin may be altering tau within the cells. There are also data to suggest that thrombin may act intracellularly to mediate tau pathology. Thrombin is expressed within neurons and astrocytes in both normal and AD brain (<38>). In AD brain the staining pattern for thrombin and prothrombin was characteristic of the pattern of NFTs, although these structures were not colabeled with antibodies for tau (<38>). Evidence supporting a role for thrombin in tau proteolysis came initially from an in vitro study showing that thrombin degraded recombinant full-length tau from the N-terminus yielding a 25-kDa fragment, while preserving the microtubule binding repeat domain (<13>). A later study, however, showed that in N2a neuroblastoma cells expressing a construct of only the tau repeat domain, thrombin cleavage could still occur, indicating additional cleavage sites (<15>). Similar results were observed in an in vitro assay (<15>).The products of thrombin proteolysis are potentially pathogenic. Thrombin cleavage of the repeat domain construct yielded fragments that rapidly aggregated, which closely correlated with toxicity in cell culture (<15>). These fragments can also induce the aggregation of full-length tau (<39>). A final point of interest relates to potential upstream modifications of tau. Endogenous tau is phosphorylated, and in AD, tau phosphorylation becomes dysregulated. This may interfere with subsequent processes including cleavage and degradation. For example, tau that is in the cis-conformation at T231 appears resistant to degradation, as cis-tau is found in dystrophic neurites while trans-tau is not. Additionally cis-tau partitions to the insoluble fraction (<30>). Phosphorylation at T231 prevents the isomerase Pin1 from converting cis-tau to trans-tau (<30>). Interestingly, phosphorylation of tau also appears to disrupt some thrombin cleavage sites, changing the pattern of cleavage without impeding the thrombin-mediated proteolysis (<14>, <28>). It has yet to be determined whether there is a difference in toxicity potential between fragments generated from phosphorylated vs. unphosphorylated tau. Nonetheless, thrombin is a potential candidate for contributing to tau proteolysis and pathology. Another serine protease recently implicated in tau processing is HTRA1. This is a ubiquitously expressed, ATP-independent intracellular protease. Expression is detectable in many tissues, including the nervous system, although expression is low (<40>). Nonetheless, this enzyme was initially implicated in AD because it may play a role in amyloid processing (<41>). Tubulin was later identified as a substrate for HTRA1, suggesting HTRA1 may be involved in mediating microtubule function (<42>, <43>). A more recent study showed that HTRA1 can cleave recombinant tau in vitro into multiple fragments of varying sizes, and furthermore can degrade insoluble and fibrillarized tau (<16>). This ability to degrade aggregates is particularly intriguing, especially in light of the fact that HTRA1 has potential chaperone activity due to its C-terminal PDZ domains and has a preference for misfolded substrates (<44>). While more work needs to be done on the role this enzyme plays in tau proteolysis, these findings further indicate the complexity and likely involvement of multiple players in this process. Calpains are calcium-activated cytosolic cysteine proteases. Two isoforms differentiated and named by their sensitivities to calcium (i.e., μ-calpain and m-calpain, also called calpain-1 and calpain-2) are abundant in the central nervous system, and respond to micromolar and millimolar concentrations of calcium, respectively (<45>). Calpain has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases [for a review, see (<46>)]. The active form of calpain-2 is found in 50–75% of NFTs in tauopathies including AD, but not in protein aggregates found in other diseases (<47>). This is consistent with another study that found equivalent calpain levels between control and AD cases, but the activity level of the enzyme isolated from AD brain tissue was increased (<48>). Excitotoxicity leading to elevated intracellular calcium is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, and is implicated in AD (<49>, <50>). This process may lead to enhanced activation of calpains (<51>). This in turn could influence a number of pathologic processes, including tau proteolysis. Indeed, tau has a number of putative calpain cleavage sites, and incubation of recombinant tau with calpain generates specific fragments, including one that is ∼35 kDa and one that is ∼17 kDa (<19>, <20>). Increasing intracellular calcium levels in PC12 cells leads to calpain-induced cleavage of tau (<18>). This may reflect a potential effect of excitotoxicity in AD. Inducing apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells yields calpain-mediated tau fragments, including a dominant ∼17 kDa fragment (<17>). Also, treating primary hippocampal neurons with pre-aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) led to the generation of tau fragments of ∼35, ∼24, and ∼17 kDa, which was blocked by addition of a calpain inhibitor (<52>, <53>). Tau fragments of the same size were also found in AD brain tissue (<19>).The pathological role of this calpain-cleaved tau is unclear. While some studies demonstrate toxicity resulting from calpain proteolysis of tau, other studies do not support this conclusion. On the one hand, expressing a 17-kDa fragment of tau based on calpain cleavage site mapping in hippocampal neurons led to neurite retraction and the appearance of varicosities after 48 h (<52>). Additionally, suppressing calpain activity in a fly model of tauopathy prevented neurodegeneration, as did expressing a calpain-resistant form of tau (<54>). In contrast, another study used mass spectroscopy and sequencing to identify the “17 kDa” tau cleavage product and found it did not correspond to the recombinant fragment utilized in the above studies (<19>). Expression of a recombinant form of the mass spectroscopy-identified fragment in hippocampal neurons was not toxic (<19>). Further studies are needed to clarify the contribution of calpain-mediated proteolysis of tau to AD pathology. There is significant evidence that tau is a caspase substrate and that caspase-mediated tau cleavage may play a role in AD pathology. Early in vitro studies demonstrated that tau is cleaved in the C-terminus by several caspases including caspase-3 and caspase-6 (<21>–<23>). Caspase-6 was also shown to cleave the N-terminus of tau in vitro (<24>). Caspase-3, which is a key effector in the apoptotic cascade, cleaves tau predominantly at the C-terminal D421 site generating a fragment often referred to as tauC3 (<22>, <23>). There may be reciprocity with the apoptosis pathway as activating caspase-3 by inducing apoptosis in cortical neuronal culture led to tau cleavage (<22>), and selectively expressing tauC3 led to apoptosis in NT2 and COS cells (<21>). This might represent a feed-forward loop of neurotoxicity. Furthermore, expressing a cleavage resistant form of tau (D421E) protects cells from apoptotic cell death (<22>). Another potential mechanism of inducing caspase-3 cleavage of tau is the presence of Aβ peptides. TauC3 is formed in primary cortical neurons after treatment with Aβ (<23>).Caspase cleavage of tau may play a role in stimulating the tau aggregation seen in AD. Indeed, in vitro polymerization assays demonstrate that caspase-cleaved tau has a greater propensity to aggregate compared to full-length tau (<23>, <55>)."
PMC3759803_2,"Intriguingly, caspase activation was shown to immediately and consistently precede the formation of tangles (<56>)  This group used in vivo multiphoton imaging in Tg4510 TAUP301L mice to simultaneously image activated caspases and Thioflavin-S positive tau tangles. There was a strong correlation between active caspases and the presence of tangles within viable neurons. In the few cells found that were caspase-positive and tangle-negative, 88% had tangles within 24 h (<56>). This seems to further support a role for caspase cleavage in the evolution of tau pathology.In order for caspase to cleave tau in the AD brain, it needs to be present in its active form. The active forms of both caspase-3 and caspase-6 are elevated in AD-specific brain regions (temporal and frontal lobes) compared to unaffected regions (cerebellum) and control brains (<57>, <58>). Furthermore, active caspase co-localizes to NFTs (<58>), and caspase-cleaved tau is found in AD-affected brain regions, particularly in neurons displaying tangle pathology (<59>, <60>). This includes tau cleaved by caspase-6 in the C-terminus (<58>–<60>) as well as in the N-terminus (<24>). TauC3 is present in AD brain – in neurons and co-localized with NFTs – and inversely correlates with cognitive function (<55>, <60>, <61>).The activation of caspases and the subsequent cleavage of tau is likely to occur independent of apoptotic cell death (<56>). The processes that may result in the activation of caspases in an apoptosis independent manner have not been clearly delineated; however several possibilities have been suggested. First, inflammation, which is a common feature of AD, may contribute to tau pathology by activating caspases. Treating cells with the prostaglandin cyclopentenone byproduct PGJ2 increased caspase activity and increased cleaved tau (<62>). Thrombin signaling can also activate caspases (<36>). Proteasomal impairment appears to be upstream of caspase activation, as inhibiting the proteasome with epoxomicin (EPX) led to activation of caspase-3 in primary neurons (<63>) and in a neuroblastoma cell line expressing wild-type tau (<64>). In both studies caspase activation correlated with the appearance and increase over time of caspase-cleaved tau species, which appeared to subsequently form aggregates in the neurons (<63>). While the mechanism is unclear, a possibility is that accumulating proteins might be a factor in initiating caspase activation. As discussed above, a number of enzymes have been shown to act on tau, under potentially pathological, as well as physiological conditions. Many of these enzymes cleave tau at discrete sites, generating specific fragments. Some of these fragments, such as those generated by thrombin, calpain, and caspase, are potentially toxic to the cell if they accumulate due to inefficient clearance mechanisms. Figure <1> illustrates the potential contribution of these different proteases to the processing of tau. These proteolytically generated tau fragments can show an increased propensity for self-association, prior to the formation of overt aggregates. Thus, in the context of enhanced proteolysis (for example by caspases) there may be increased low-order oligomers formed by cleaved tau species. These oligomers may be unable to be cleared as effectively by the cell and contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Therefore coordination between proteolytic processing of tau and clearance by degradative pathways is essential for maintaining the appropriate levels of tau in a functional state. Below we will discuss the main degradative pathways of the cell-the proteasome and autophagy-which likely clear full-length tau as well as proteolytically generated tau fragments. rhetorical Figure 1 Proteolytic processing of tau. Under pathological and physiological conditions, tau undergoes cleavage at many distinct proteolytic sites by a myriad of proteases. The action of these proteases can lead to both protection and/or exacerbation of pathology. For example, cleavage of tau by caspase (Casp) 3, caspase-6, calpain (Calp), and thrombin (Thrm) leads to the production of toxic fragments of tau that exacerbate pathology. On the other hand, cleavage of tau by PSA, Htra1, and – in some circumstances – caspase-3, may facilitate its degradation, which may protect neurons from AD-related neuronal death. As discussed above, a number of enzymes have been shown to act on tau, under potentially pathological, as well as physiological conditions. Many of these enzymes cleave tau at discrete sites, generating specific fragments. Some of these fragments, such as those generated by thrombin, calpain, and caspase, are potentially toxic to the cell if they accumulate due to inefficient clearance mechanisms. Figure <1> illustrates the potential contribution of these different proteases to the processing of tau.

Thus, in the context of enhanced proteolysis (for example by caspases) there may be increased low-order oligomers formed by cleaved tau species. These oligomers may be unable to be cleared as effectively by the cell and contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Therefore coordination between proteolytic processing of tau and clearance by degradative pathways is essential for maintaining the appropriate levels of tau in a functional state. Below we will discuss the main degradative pathways of the cell-the proteasome and autophagy-which likely clear full-length tau as well as proteolytically generated tau fragments. The proteasome is a multimeric barrel-shaped structure that is a key complex for clearing soluble cytosolic proteins. The 26S proteasome has a regulatory cap (19S, or alternatively the 11S regulatory particle) on either end of its catalytic core (20S), which contains the proteolytic activities and degrades substrates tagged with poly-ubiquitin chains as the targeting sequence. The regulatory cap in conjunction with chaperone proteins unfolds the protein substrate and removes the ubiquitin tag in an ATP-dependent process prior to feeding the protein into the catalytic core, where it is systematically degraded by the enzymatic properties of the proteasome. The 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic core without its regulatory caps, is also able to degrade natively unfolded substrates directly through an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent process. As shown in Figure <2>, tau is an ideal proteasomal substrate for either form of the proteasome because it is a relatively small, unfolded, short-lived cytosolic protein (<64>–<67>). rhetorical Figure 2 Physiological degradation of tau. Tau is degraded by both the proteasome and autophagy systems. Targeting of tau to either system may be determined by the extent and nature of post-translational modifications, the folding state, the level of aggregation, and its interaction with chaperone proteins or ubiquitin ligases. Monomeric tau is natively unfolded making it a likely target for the 20S proteasome. Monomeric tau also interacts with the E3 ligase, CHIP, which can lead to its ubiquitylation and degradation via the 26S proteasome or autophagy. Certain cleavage products and phosphorylated forms of tau, as well as, monoubiquitylated tau and tau aggregates are selectively degraded by autophagy. The proteasome is a multimeric barrel-shaped structure that is a key complex for clearing soluble cytosolic proteins. The 26S proteasome has a regulatory cap (19S, or alternatively the 11S regulatory particle) on either end of its catalytic core (20S), which contains the proteolytic activities and degrades substrates tagged with poly-ubiquitin chains as the targeting sequence.

PMC3759803_3,"The 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic core without its regulatory caps, is also able to degrade natively unfolded substrates directly through an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent process  As shown in Figure <2>, tau is an ideal proteasomal substrate for either form of the proteasome because it is a relatively small, unfolded, short-lived cytosolic protein (<64>–<67>).The accumulation of proteins in AD patients’ brains generated interest in the role of proteasomal function. There is evidence suggesting that proteasomal activity, but not protein level, is decreased in AD-sensitive brain regions specifically compared to unaffected regions (<68>, <69>). Additionally, tau appears to be physically associated with the proteasome in brain tissue from AD cases. When tau was immunoprecipitated it pulled down both the 26S and 20S proteasomes, while immunoprecipitating for the 20S catalytic core pulled down tau (<69>). This suggests tau is being targeted to the proteasome, but may also indicate impaired ability to complete degradation; hence it is remaining associated with the proteasome. Further, there was an inverse correlation between proteasomal activity and high molecular weight forms of tau (<69>). This may suggest that abnormal proteins themselves may interfere with proteasomal degradative processes. Indeed, in vitro aggregated paired helical filament tau could inhibit proteasome activity (<69>). A number of studies have used various in vitro techniques to analyze proteasomal degradation of tau. These include cell culture and cell free studies. Not surprisingly, if recombinant tau is incubated with isolated 20S proteasomal complexes, degradation occurs (<65>). In this system proteolysis is bidirectional. Also, if tau is first ubiquitylated in an in vitro reaction and then incubated with isolated 26S proteasomes supplemented with MgCl2 and ATP, degradation proceeds (<66>). These data indicate tau can be a substrate for both forms of the proteasome. Similar data has been obtained from studies using various cell culture systems as well as animal tissue and primary cultures with a variety of proteasomal inhibitors. When HEK cells are co-transfected with tau and ubiquitin, tau accumulates in the insoluble fraction. Its accumulation in the insoluble fraction is enhanced by proteasomal inhibition (using ALLN or MG-132) suggesting that tau is degraded by the proteasome (<66>). In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, treatment with lactacystin, a selective inhibitor of the 20S catalytic core, maintained levels of transfected wild-type full-length tau (4R0N) after cycloheximide treatment halted protein synthesis (<65>). Similarly, overexpressing the FTDP-17 mutant P301L tau in SH-SY5Y cells and then treating with lactacystin led to significantly increased tau levels (<70>). Lactacystin also caused accumulation of endogenous tau in the HT22 murine neuronal cell line (<71>). In immortalized mouse cortical neuronal cells inducibly expressing full-length wild-type tau, EPX slowed the degradation of full-length tau (<72>). In M1C neuroblastoma cells that inducibly express wild-type full-length tau (4R0N), EPX, and MG-132 induced accumulation of full-length tau but there was a concomitant loss of C-terminus immunoreactivity (<64>). This was attributed to caspase cleavage, as activated caspase-3 was detected, and a caspase inhibitor preserved C-terminal immunoreactivity (<64>). Additionally, incubation of rat brain extract (containing endogenous tau and proteasomal enzymes) with the proteasome activators Mg2+ and ATP resulted in lower total tau levels with an increase in smaller forms, compared to extract not supplemented with Mg2+ and ATP (<73>). The loss of tau was blocked by lactacystin giving further evidence that the proteasome was degrading tau (<73>). The story is more complex, however, as proteasomal inhibition under physiological conditions does not consistently lead to tau accumulation. For example, treatment of primary neurons with an Hsp90 inhibitor to interrupt the proper chaperoning of tau leads to decreased levels of tau. Adding MG-132 to block the proteasome prevented the Hsp90 inhibitor-induced reduction in total tau. MG-132 alone had no effect on tau levels (<67>). This might suggest that under normal circumstances, if proteasomal impairment occurs, tau levels are maintained by autophagic degradation. But when the system is pushed to promote proteasomal degradation over autophagy – such as by inhibiting Hsp90 – then the homeostatic maintenance of tau levels is disrupted and tau degradation does not occur when the proteasome is inhibited. Autophagy is the process of “self-eating.” Under starvation conditions, bulk autophagy can be induced to catabolize cellular substrates to generate energy. However it is now evident that autophagy is an ongoing clearance mechanism for larger, longer-lived proteins and aggregates, as well as organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes (<74>) and pathogenic bacteria (<75>–<77>). There are three forms of autophagy: microautophagy, macroautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. The most common and well understood is macroautophagy, hereafter referred to simply as autophagy. For a more complete review of autophagy, see (<78>). Briefly, a double membrane autophagophore is initiated and subsequently expanded to engulf a region of cytoplasm containing the substrate/substrates to be degraded, such as tau (see Figure <2>). Once fully formed into an enclosed vesicle called an autophagosome, it is trafficked to a lysosome where it undergoes fusion to become an autophagic vacuole (AV). The lysosomal enzymes degrade the inner membrane of the autophagosome as well as the delivered contents. The enzymes responsible for degrading protein substrates of autophagy are the cathepsins. Once the contents are fully degraded the lysosome is regenerated via acidification through vacuolar ATPases. There are 15 core autophagy related genes (Atgs) that are involved in the process of autophagy. Many of these have E1, E2, or E3 ligase activity to catalyze the reactions necessary for the initiation and expansion of the autophagosomal membrane. Critical early steps in the formation of the autophagopore require a complex of Atg proteins that conjugate phosphatidylethanolamine onto Atg8 family members (including LC3), a process that is critical for allowing expansion of the autophagosomal membrane. Conjugated LC3, called LC3-II, is the canonical marker of autophagosomes. Atg7 is a critical E1 ligase for several of the reactions necessary for autophagy (<74>). There is significant support for the possibility of defective autophagy in AD. Electron microscopic analysis of brain tissue from confirmed AD cases revealed that AVs accumulated in dystrophic neurites and correlated with the presence of filamentous tau (<79>). However, this correlation was not quantified (<79>). Similar results were observed in mouse models of AD. For example, in a presenilin 1 (PS1)/Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) double transgenic mouse, AVs were prevalent in dystrophic neurites at as early as 4.5 months without a similar accumulation of other structures such as lysosomes (<80>, <81>). In these transgenic mice LC3-positive bodies were particularly apparent in neurites surrounding amyloid plaques, and immunoblotting of hippocampi from 6 month old transgenic PS1/APP mice revealed increased levels of LC3-II compared to wild-type mice (<81>). It is well established that mutations in PS1 result in familial AD, and until recently it was thought that this was only due to alterations in APP processing. However PS1 has a number of non-secretase functions, including acting as the chaperone for the vacuolar-ATPase used to acidify the lysosomal lumen (<82>, <83>). Mutations in PS1 were shown to impair the acidification of lysosomes, which is necessary for activating the proteolytic enzymes in this compartment. Improper acidification and impaired proteolysis of substrates would compromise the autophagy system and result in the accumulation of AVs as described above."
PMC3759803_4,"However, another mouse model, the TgCRND8 mouse, which expresses mutant APP only, also has increased staining for LC3-II, as well as an increase in cathepsin D-positive lysosomes (<84>)  This demonstrates that in the absence of mutant PS1, AD-associated impairment in autophagy occurs and thus is due to other factors. Treatment of ex vivo hippocampal slice cultures with lysosomal disruptors causes the formation of enlarged, dystrophic neurites filled with AVs and lysosomes, similar to what is seen in mouse AD models and human AD tissue (<85>, <86>). It has also been suggested that specific cathepsins may become extralysosomal in certain diseases, including AD (<87>, <88>). Together these observations implicate a possible failure of autophagy as part of AD pathogenesis. As indicated above, a functioning lysosomal compartment is critical for the completion of autophagy. Given the possibility of a defect at this level of autophagy, numerous studies have directly assessed the effects of impairing lysosomal function on tau turnover, including specifically targeting the cathepsins. In an early study the direct cleavage of tau by cathepsin D was investigated in an in vitro assay using tau partially purified from rat brain in combination with cathepsin D from human liver. Incubation of tau with cathepsin D at pH 4.0 resulted in a decrease in full-length tau and a concomitant increase in cleaved fragments of varying sizes (<89>). Similarly, adding exogenous cathepsin D to homogenates of rat cortex at a neutral pH also generated tau fragments. Intriguingly, if a cysteine protease inhibitor was added to the assay, tau cleavage stopped at the 29-kDa fragment, suggesting that cathepsin D (an aspartyl protease) could cleave tau to a 29-kDa fragment after which other proteases may act to further degrade the protein. This also suggests if cathepsin D was able to escape from the lysosome, for example in the context of an AD-related stressor, it could still function in the neutral environment of the cytosol. However, the activity of cathepsin D at the more neutral pH may be more impeded than appears, as a previous study found cathepsin D’s proteolytic activity was significantly reduced above pH 6.0 (<90>). Treating hippocampal slices with chloroquine (CQ), which raises the pH of lysosomes to impair enzymatic function, was associated with increased levels of full-length tau (<89>, <91>). This was in conjunction with an accumulation of intracellular PHF1 immunopositive tau (<91>). In M1C neuroblastoma cells that inducibly express full-length wild-type tau (4R0N), treatment with CQ also significantly slowed down tau degradation, and caused its accumulation (<92>). Treatment of hippocampal slices with the cathepsin modulator ZPAD (which stimulates cathepsin D very strongly) appears to increase the proteolysis of full-length tau resulting in the production of smaller fragments, including a phosphorylated 29 kDa fragment (<86>, <89>). This partial degradation of tau was inhibited by inclusion of a selective cathepsin D inhibitor (<86>). Cathepsin D seems particularly important for degrading tau, as its expression was neuroprotective in a Drosophila tauopathy model. Levels of cathepsin D are elevated in flies expressing mutant human tau. If cathepsin D is genetically ablated, these tau flies exhibit enhanced neurotoxicity and a shorter lifespan (<93>).Modulating autophagy through other approaches also indicates that tau can be degraded through this pathway. Overexpressing only the repeat domain of tau containing an FTDP-17 mutation in neuroblastoma cells leads to tau aggregation as well as the appearance of smaller proteolytic fragments. Using the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) to block the formation of autophagosomes led to an increase in both soluble and insoluble tau (<94>). Directly activating autophagy through a variety of mechanisms leads consistently to enhanced tau clearance – either pathological forms or total tau. In a hippocampal slice preparation methylene blue was used to induce autophagy, which resulted in a decrease in phosphorylated tau and insoluble tau, specifically (<95>). In a cell line expressing the repeat domain of tau containing the FTDP-17ΔK280 mutant, treatment with the disaccharide trehalose, an mTor-independent autophagy activator, significantly reduced aggregated tau as measured by Thioflavin-S staining, as well as total tau levels both soluble and insoluble as detected by western blotting (<96>). Stimulating autophagy either through serum withdrawal or rapamycin treatment in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing P301L tau that had been induced to aggregate led to substantial reduction in aggregates that was prevented by 3-MA (<70>). In a mouse model expressing the FTDP-17 mutant P301S, promoting autophagy with trehalose treatment beginning at weaning significantly reduced insoluble tau, as well as tau phosphorylated at T212/S214 (AT100) (<97>). However, no other phosphorylation sites were assessed. This effect was correlated with improved neuronal survival in cortical layers I–III (<97>). Stimulating autophagy via genetic manipulation of the mTor pathway decreased total and phosphorylated tau in the same mouse model (<98>). Conversely, inhibiting autophagy (also via mTor) lead to increased total and AT8-positive phosphorylated tau (<98>). Mice in which the critical autophagy gene Atg7 is knocked out in forebrain neurons develop age-dependent neurodegeneration with accumulation of phosphorylated tau within intracellular inclusions (<99>). These inclusions specifically contained tau phosphorylated at AT8, AT100, and TG3 epitopes, but not PHF1. Significantly, if tau was also knocked out in these autophagy-deficient mice, neurodegeneration was reduced (<99>).Interestingly, other evidence for the role of autophagy in clearing tau was the result of attempting to elucidate the role of the proteasome in tau degradation. Treating rat primary neurons with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 actually led to a reduction in total tau. This effect was likely due to a compensatory upregulation of autophagy, as evidenced by increased LC3-II protein and an increased number of autophagosomes in treated cells (<96>). This will be discussed in more detail below, as it has important ramifications for the intersection of these two degradative pathways. There is compelling evidence for significant and extensive interplay between the autophagy and proteasomal systems. This has intriguing implications for disease processes and specifically tau degradation in AD. First, while each system preferentially degrades specific substrates, there are many substrates that can be degraded by both systems, tau being a prime example (<25>). For instance, a particular substrate may be degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, but if that system is impaired and/or there is an excess of that substrate it may be degraded in a compensatory manner by autophagy. Another possibility is that particular forms of a substrate may be shuttled to one pathway or another. In the case of tau, as a monomer it is natively unfolded and hence a likely proteasomal substrate, as discussed above. However, any of the numerous modifications tau undergoes during AD pathogenesis may render it less able to do so, for example, by inducing conformational changes to a more ordered structure as suggested by several conformation-specific antibodies that label tau in AD brain (Alz-50, MC-1, etc.). Additionally, oligomerized or aggregated tau may not be a preferred proteasomal target. It has been suggested that this change in state is part of the signal for tau to be degraded by autophagy. This is supported by evidence that full-length tau, which has a lower propensity for aggregating, is cleared by the proteasome while caspase-cleaved tau, which is more aggregate prone, goes through autophagy (<72>). Also, aggregated tau can be cleared by inducing autophagy (<70>, <96>).Ubiquitin is implicated in targeting substrates to both pathways."
PMC3759803_5,"Historically, poly-ubiquitin chains generated through lysine 48 (K48) linkages were viewed as the prototypical proteasomal targeting sequence, while K63 chains appeared more specific for autophagy  However, the experimental evidence indicates a more complex picture. For example, if HEK cells are transfected with tau and ubiquitin, tau is readily ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome (<66>). However, if a ubiquitin construct containing a site mutation at K63 is transfected in, no ubiquitylation of tau occurs. Other mutated forms of ubiquitin, including ubiquitin unable to form linkages at K48, still resulted in tau ubiquitylation. This indicates that in this experimental overexpression paradigm, K63 linkages are the primary ubiquitin linkage for tau, and they target tau to the proteasome rather than to autophagy (<66>). However, another study, also using HEK cells and ubiquitin K48 and K63 mutants, demonstrated that in the presence of the E3 ligase CHIP, tau could be ubiquitylated by both K48 and K63 linkages (<100>). The likelihood that in vivo tau can be ubiquitylated in multiple ways is supported by studies showing tau isolated from NFTs in human brain has several forms of ubiquitin linkages as well as mono-ubiquitylation (<101>, <102>). These data suggest that the physical structure of the ubiquitin chain is unlikely to be a sufficient signal for selectively targeting tau to either the proteasome or autophagy. An alternate mechanism for specifically targeting substrates is the involvement of chaperone proteins. The chaperones involved in proteasomal targeting are not well characterized, although it is known that ubiquitin-tagged substrates are trafficked to the organelle. Currently identified chaperones include p62 and Hsp70 (<66>, <100>). Slightly more is known about autophagy adaptors, and there is significant overlap, as both p62 and Hsp70 are adaptors for this pathway as well (<103>, <104>). This further complicates the understanding of how a substrate is selectively targeted to one path or the other. For example, a ubiquitylated substrate can be bound by p62 and either delivered to the proteasome (<66>) or engulfed by an autophagosome via p62 binding to LC3 (<105>). These findings suggest the involvement of a currently unidentified chaperones and/or targeting signals, or undetermined additional factors.Other characteristics of the substrate are likely to also play a role in successfully targeting the protein either to the proteasome or to autophagy. In the case of tau, two modifications seem to be critical for this process: phosphorylation and truncation. For example, in the study where rat brain extract was incubated with Mg2+ and ATP, there was an overall decrease in tau due to proteasomal activity; however tau phosphorylated at the PHF1 and Tau-1 epitopes seemed to be preferentially degraded as they were non-detectable within 3 h (<73>). The preferential degradation of specific phospho-forms of tau by a particular pathway has been reported in other studies as well. In CHO cells overexpressing P301L mutant tau, treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin led to a more pronounced proteasome-mediated reduction in tau phosphorylated at proline-directed S/T sites compared to total tau (<67>). However, the levels of tau phosphorylated at KXGS sites within the repeat domain were not reduced by geldanamycin treatment. In agreement with those findings, inhibiting autophagy in primary rat cortical neurons with 3-MA resulted in the selective accumulation of tau phosphorylated at the KXGS motif S262 (recognized by the 12E8 antibody) (<106>). Additionally, in a hippocampal slice preparation, induction of autophagy by treatment with methylene blue led to a decrease in phosphorylated tau and insoluble tau without an effect on total tau (<95>). Activating autophagy with trehalose in rat cortical neurons demonstrated certain phospho-epitopes (AT8, PHF1, and 12E8) were reduced more significantly than total tau – up to 80% compared to the 20% reduction in total tau (<96>). Finally, caspase-3 cleaved tau has a shorter half-life than full-length tau and is preferentially degraded by autophagy (<72>). Additional modified forms of tau have yet to be fully examined for their preferred route of degradation.As specific substrates are targeted to one degradative pathway or the other, the function of each system can also directly impact the functioning of the other. It is well documented that blocking the proteasome with small molecule inhibitors causes an increase in autophagic flux (<107>). This can be seen both as increased autophagosome formation and maturation as well as enhanced degradation of autophagy substrates (<96>). However the converse is not true; autophagy impairment does not elevate proteasomal function and, in fact, rather strikingly inhibits it. There are several possible mechanisms for this inhibition. The accumulation of large aggregated substrates might impair the proteasome, as seen for PHF tau (<69>). Also, reduced recycling of p62 by impairing autophagy (causing its accumulation) will impair proteasomal processing, potentially by p62 competing with other chaperones for proteasomal targets and impeding their delivery (<107>). The degradation of tau is thus a complex process mediated by multiple factors. While much is known about how tau can be cleared, additional studies are needed to clarify what actually happens in both the normal brain and in the context of AD. This information will yield critical insights into potential therapeutics. Given the data indicating tau can be processed by both autophagy and the proteasome, and furthermore that the signaling mechanisms directing substrates to either path are shared, it is unclear how decisions regarding which way tau is degraded are made. One possibility could be tau’s physical state of oligomerization. Soluble, monomeric tau is an ideal proteasomal substrate. Indeed, it has been clearly demonstrated that tau can be degraded by the proteasome (<65>–<67>, <73>). It thus can be suggested that under physiologic circumstances much of tau is degraded in this manner, with select modified forms being cleared by autophagy. However, within the context of the AD milieu, additional tau modifications and degradative impairments may cause the balance to shift away from proteasomal degradation toward autophagy. For example, as discussed above, certain modified forms of tau, such as caspase-cleaved tau, have a stronger tendency to aggregate. As tau begins to assemble into oligomers, it may become increasingly undesirable as a proteasomal substrate. These low-order, soluble oligomers may be preferentially degraded by autophagy. However, as previously discussed, autophagy is likely impaired in AD. The tendency for certain phospho-epitopes to show preferential clearance by certain pathways may also relate to their propensity for aggregation. As tau oligomers increase in size, density, and modifications during the development of filaments and tangles, not only will they be unable to undergo proteasomal degradation, they may directly impair proteasomal function (<69>). This proteasomal impairment could have multiple effects. For example, autophagy may initially be activated as a compensatory response. Caspase-3 and possibly other proteases may also be activated as well. However, this may result in an accumulation of potentially toxic cleaved forms of tau. Additionally, given the significant evidence that autophagy is impaired in AD, possibly at the level of the lysosomes, proteasomally mediated activation may serve to further obstruct the autophagy system (see Figure <3>). rhetorical Figure 3 Alzheimer disease-related disruption of tau degradation. Impairment of protein degradation is a known component of both familial and sporadic AD. Familial AD-related mutations of PS1 are linked to impairment of lysosomal acidification and/or fusion to the autophagosome, while sporadic factors leading to similar impairments have not yet been elucidated. Impairment of the lysosome/autophagosome leads to accumulation of dysfunctional autophagic vacuoles (AVs), cytosolic p62, and aggregates of tau."
PMC3759803_6,"Dysfunction of autophagy further inhibits the proteasome, possibly via accumulation of p62, which can be a chaperone for both systems  P62 is usually recycled via autophagy and accumulates in the cytosol when autophagy is impaired. Hypothetically, this allows p62 to compete with other proteasome chaperones thus inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Further, accumulation of aggregated proteins has also been shown to inhibit the proteasome. Taken together, this could lead to accumulation of soluble tau, and thus more proteolytic processing and further aggregate. Hence, a vicious cycle of degradative pathway impairment and tau accumulation/aggregation may contribute to the neurodegenerative processes in AD. Given the data indicating tau can be processed by both autophagy and the proteasome, and furthermore that the signaling mechanisms directing substrates to either path are shared, it is unclear how decisions regarding which way tau is degraded are made. One possibility could be tau’s physical state of oligomerization. Soluble, monomeric tau is an ideal proteasomal substrate.

However, within the context of the AD milieu, additional tau modifications and degradative impairments may cause the balance to shift away from proteasomal degradation toward autophagy. For example, as discussed above, certain modified forms of tau, such as caspase-cleaved tau, have a stronger tendency to aggregate. As tau begins to assemble into oligomers, it may become increasingly undesirable as a proteasomal substrate. These low-order, soluble oligomers may be preferentially degraded by autophagy. However, as previously discussed, autophagy is likely impaired in AD. The tendency for certain phospho-epitopes to show preferential clearance by certain pathways may also relate to their propensity for aggregation. As tau oligomers increase in size, density, and modifications during the development of filaments and tangles, not only will they be unable to undergo proteasomal degradation, they may directly impair proteasomal function (<69>). This proteasomal impairment could have multiple effects. For example, autophagy may initially be activated as a compensatory response. Caspase-3 and possibly other proteases may also be activated as well. However, this may result in an accumulation of potentially toxic cleaved forms of tau. Additionally, given the significant evidence that autophagy is impaired in AD, possibly at the level of the lysosomes, proteasomally mediated activation may serve to further obstruct the autophagy system (see Figure <3>). It is clear that tau plays a significant role in AD pathology, although the mechanisms involved have not been clearly delineated. Tau is a normal neuronal protein that modulates microtubule-based functions, and becomes increasingly hyperphosphorylated, truncated, and otherwise modified in AD. These modifications not only impair tau’s normal function, but also appear to promote its oligomerization. These oligomers eventually accumulate to form the NFTs which are pathognomonic for AD. While the NFTs may be harmful to the cell in some ways, it is now believed that the principal toxicity results from pre-aggregated, soluble tau oligomers. Thus, understanding how these tau species can be cleared may allow for the development of effective therapeutic approaches. It is clear from the data that certain species of tau are preferentially degraded by the proteasome and others by autophagy. There is evidence that both of these degradative systems are likely impaired at some level in AD. Additionally, there is a complex interplay between the proteolytic and degradative pathways that suggests a cycle of pathology may develop in AD whereby alterations in tau processing, including by cytosolic proteases, pushes more tau toward the autophagy system. Decreased autophagic function would result in accumulation of these autophagy-cleared tau species. The combination of impaired autophagy and accumulating substrates has the potential to lead to proteasomal inhibition, in addition to other factors (such as Aβ) that may impair the proteasome in AD (<108>). This then further promotes cytosolic accumulation of tau leading to its aggregation. Additionally, modifications including caspase-3 cleavage and hyperphosphorylation promote aggregation even of full-length tau, reducing the pool of functional tau.Understanding how tau is cleared may enable us to identify potential mechanisms for enhancing clearance of pathological forms of tau. Ameliorating the deficit in autophagy is a likely target for this process, and initial results of stimulating autophagy show promise for clearing tau. Indeed, several studies aimed at stimulating autophagy have demonstrated efficacy in reducing phosphorylated and aggregated tau in both in vitro and in vivo models (<95>–<98>). These studies are an important initial step toward elucidating the exact role of tau degradation in modulating neurodegeneration in AD. Further studies that better gauge the contribution of each degradative pathway will be necessary. Due to the complexity of the cellular environment, in vitro studies that can tightly control for variables including tau modifications and proteolytic pathway function will likely be instrumental. Ultimately, a more complete understanding of the differential contribution of various proteolytic and degradative pathways will provide critical opportunities for therapeutically addressing the tau pathology associated with neurodegeneration in AD. The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. One of the defining pathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the intraneuronal accumulation of tau. The tau that forms these accumulations is altered both posttranslationally and conformationally, and there is now significant evidence that soluble forms of these modified tau species are the toxic entities rather than the insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. However there is still noteworthy debate concerning which specific pathological forms of tau are the contributors to neuronal dysfunction and death in AD. Given that increases in aberrant forms of tau play a role in the neurodegeneration process in AD, there is growing interest in understanding the degradative pathways that remove tau from the cell, and the selectivity of these different pathways for various forms of tau. Indeed, one can speculate that deficits in a pathway that selectively removes certain pathological forms of tau could play a pivotal role in AD. In this review we will discuss the different proteolytic and degradative machineries that may be involved in removing tau from the cell. How deficits in these different degradative pathways may contribute to abnormal accumulation of tau in AD will also be considered. In addition, the issue of the selective targeting of specific tau species to a given degradative pathway for clearance from the cell will be addressed. ."
PMC3249157_0,"In sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neurofibrillary lesion formation is preceded by extensive post-translational modification of the microtubule associated protein tau. To identify the modification signature associated with tau lesion formation at single amino acid resolution, immunopurified paired helical filaments were isolated from AD brain and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The resulting spectra identified monomethylation of lysine residues as a new tau modification. The methyl-lysine was distributed among seven residues located in the projection and microtubule binding repeat regions of tau protein, with one site, K254, being a substrate for a competing lysine modification, ubiquitylation. To characterize methyl lysine content in intact tissue, hippocampal sections prepared from post mortem late-stage AD cases were subjected to double-label confocal fluorescence microscopy using anti-tau and anti-methyl lysine antibodies. Anti-methyl lysine immunoreactivity colocalized with 78 ± 13% of neurofibrillary tangles in these specimens. Together these data provide the first evidence that tau in neurofibrillary lesions is post-translationally modified by lysine methylation.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is defined in part by the appearance of intracellular inclusions composed of the microtubule associated protein tau [<35>]. The mechanisms that drive tau lesion formation in the highly prevalent sporadic form of AD are not fully understood, but appear to involve abnormal post-translational modifications (PTMs) that influence tau function, stability, and aggregation propensity [<45>]. For example, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein on certain hydroxy amino acids favors lesion formation by dissociating tau from its microtubule binding partner [<4>, <7>] and by directly raising its rate and extent of aggregation [<1>, <9>, <48>]. Although tau phosphorylation state is mediated directly by phosphotransferases, it also is modulated by competing modifications on hydroxy amino acids such as O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) [<40>]. The reciprocal relationship between these tau modifications is leveraged by O-GlcNAcase inhibitors, which by increasing O-GlcNAcylation, lower phosphorylation stoichiometry and depress neurofibrillary lesion formation [<65>]. In addition to hydroxy amino acids, Lys residues are modified on tau protein, and these too can influence tau metabolism and aggregation. For example, ubiquitylation of tau at Lys residues modulates intracellular tau levels [<53>, <61>], the magnitude of which affects both nucleation and extension phases of the aggregation reaction [<12>]. Together these observations suggest that tau aggregation is under complex regulatory control that involves crosstalk among diverse and sometimes competing PTMs.To gain insight into the tau PTM signature most closely associated with neurofibrillary lesion formation at single amino acid resolution, we have begun mapping modifications on authentic, paired helical filaments (PHFs) isolated from AD brain using mass spectrometry methods, with special emphasis on Lys modifications [<13>]. Preliminary analysis identified K254, K311, and K353 within the tau microtubule binding repeat region as ubiquitylation sites that were at least partially occupied in PHFs [<13>]. Recently, acetylation was discovered as another Lys-directed tau modification associated with tau-bearing lesions in AD and frontotemporal dementia [<11>, <46>]. Tau acetylated in vitro resulted in occupation of diverse sites that overlapped with those we had determined to be ubiquitylated in disease [<46>]. Therefore, acetylation is another candidate modification for regulating tau turnover indirectly through the ubiquitin–proteasome system [<46>]. Moreover, in other biochemical pathways, such as histone-mediated control of gene expression, certain acetylated Lys residues can alternatively be methylated, contributing to complex cross-talk among Lys and hydroxyl amino acid modifications [<36>]. These observations suggest that the web of tau PTMs is potentially complex, with Lys-directed modifications playing key regulatory roles with respect to rates of tau turnover and aggregation.Here we extend our characterization of PHF-tau using mass spectrometry methods by expanding search criteria to include both acetyl- and methyl-lysine modifications. Although we found no evidence for tau acetylation/trimethylation at the level of detection available in our datasets, the results show that Lys monomethylation is a widespread PHF-tau modification. These data reveal tau methylation as a new tau PTM accompanying PHF deposition in vivo. This study used only archival, de-identified post mortem brain tissue samples from autopsies performed with informed consent of each patient or relative via procedures approved by the relevant institutional committees (University of Rochester, USA). Paraformaldehyde-fixed brain tissue was obtained from six elderly subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD [mean age 80 ± 10 years (SD)] that was confirmed on neuropathological evaluation in which the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) age-adjusted criteria were met [<47>], and from four pathologically normal controls [mean age 62 ± 10 years (SD)] without history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders. All AD cases satisfied criteria for Braak stages V or VI, whereas none of the control cases met pathological criteria for AD [<6>]. PHF-tau was isolated from pooled, late-stage (Braak stages V or VI) AD neocortical regions by immunoaffinity chromatography (MC1 monoclonal antibody) as described previously [<30>]. PHF-tau was digested in solution in the presence of 40% methanol with either trypsin (Promega) or Lys-C (Sigma) followed by phosphopeptide enrichment (Immobilized gallium, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as detailed earlier [<13>]. Reductive methylation was done as described previously with minor modifications [<18>]. Briefly, lyophilized recombinant full-length human 2N4R tau (100 μg) was re-suspended in 100 μl of 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6) and methylated (room temperature for 2 h) in the presence of 0.1 M sodium cyanoborohydride and 20 mM formaldehyde. Reaction products were separated from reactants by spin dialysis in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. Mass spectrometric analysis of PHF-tau was performed using an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur v.1.4 software (Thermo Electron) coupled online to a nanoflow XTreme Simple LC system (CVC Micro-Tech) as previously described [<13>]. Briefly, peptides were either loaded onto a trap column (Agilent Zorbax C18 guard column, or Michrom Bioresources peptide cap trap) or loaded directly into the sample loop with 95% solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and 5% solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A 60 min linear gradient of 5–25% solvent B was used to elute the peptides from the reverse phase column (150 mm × 75 μm, 5 μm 300 Å C18; CVC Micro-Tech).The mass spectrometer was equipped with a nanospray ionization source (Thermo Electron) using an uncoated 10 μm i.d."

Rabbit polyclonal anti-methyl lysine (meK) antibody was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (ADI-KAP-TF121; Plymouth Meeting, USA). Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc (West Grove, USA) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, USA), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody used for Western Blot was from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc (Gaithersburg, USA). Coronal hippocampal tissue sections were cut (20 μm thickness) and processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously [<17>, <33>]. Sections were rehydrated in PBST (2.7 mM KCl, 0.14 M NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and fixed (10 min) in ice cold methanol. After 3 × 5 min rinses in PBST, sections were blocked (1 h at 19°C) with 5% goat serum diluted in PBST, then incubated (overnight at 4°C) with primary antibodies diluted in 2.5% goat serum (Tau5, 1 μg/ml; Anti-meK, 0.3 μg/ml; AT8, 0.1 μg/ml). After washing in PBST (3 × 10 min), sections were incubated (1 h at 19°C) with fluorescent dye-labeled secondary antibodies (1.5 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG; 2 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG). After washing in PBST (3 × 5 min), tissue was treated (10 min at 19°C) with 0.1% Sudan Black B (EM Diagnostics, Gibbstown, USA) in 80% ethanol to suppress lipofuscin autofluorescence [<59>]. Sections were then washed (2 × 5 min) in PBST and once for 5 min in 33 mM NaH2PO4,162 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) and sealed with clear nail enamel. Labeled sections were viewed in a Leica TCS SL laser-scanning confocal system (40× oil HCX Plan Apo CS 0.75–1.25 NA or 100× oil HCX Plan Apo CS 0.70–1.40 NA objective lens) operated at wavelengths optimized for simultaneous detection of Alexa Fluor 488 (λex = 488 nm; λem = 500–530 nm), and Cy3 (λex = 543 nm; λem = 560–600 nm). Long wavelength fluorescence (λex = 633 nm; λem = 650–740 nm) also was monitored to assess autofluorescence intensity. Digital confocal images were captured at 1× and 3× digital zoom, and stored in Tagged Image Format. Both secondary antibodies displayed minimal non-specific staining under these conditions as determined by immunostaining in the absence of primary antibodies. For immunoadsorption assay, primary antibodies anti-meK (0.3 μg/ml) and AT8 (0.1 μg/ml) were diluted in 2.5% goat serum containing 2000-fold molar excess of recombinant 2N4R tau (0.52 mg/ml) and incubated overnight (4°C) with agitation. Pellets were separated by centrifugation at 30,000×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for immunohistochemistry as described above. The proportion of meK-positive lesions was estimated using the Wilson score method [<17>, <49>]. Sufficient technical replicates (defined as Tau-positive bodies at least 7 μm in both length and width) were counted from at least five fields of each case so that the Wilson 95% confidence interval for colocalization was <15%. Overall mean colocalization was then calculated as the average of all six biological replicate means and reported ± standard deviation. To identify sites of Lys modification in PHF-tau, previously collected MS datasets obtained from two independent preparations of authentic AD-brain derived PHFs (digested with either trypsin or Lys-C proteases; [<13>]) were interrogated using the SEQUEST database search algorithm programmed to identify unmodified Lys residues along with sites of monomethylation (K + 14), dimethylation (K + 28), trimethylation (K + 42), acetylation (also K + 42), and ubiquitylation (K + 114). Sequence coverage in these datasets included 25 out of the 44 Lys residues present in the longest form of human brain tau protein (2N4R tau, Fig. <1>). This sequence coverage is based on only the unmodified, lysine-modified (methylated and ubiquitylated) and phosphorylated forms of PHF-tau. Although these search conditions confirmed three sites of ubiquitylation in the microtubule binding repeat region (K254, K311, and K353; [<13>]), no evidence for either K + 28 or K + 42 masses was found, indicating that dimethyl-, trimethyl-, and acetyl-lysine were not present in the coverage area at the level of detection available in our datasets. However, robust monomethylation was identified at seven sites distributed throughout the tau sequence (Table <1>). Three of the sites (K163, K174, and K180) reside within the proline-rich region of the tau N-terminal projection domain, which mediates interactions with microtubule-associated proteins such as actin [<27>] and the Src homology three domain of plasma membrane-associated proteins including Src family kinases [<37>] and phospholipase Cγ [<54>]. In contrast, K254, K267, and K290 are part of the first and second repeats of the microtubule-binding domain. They reside within or adjacent to the core β-sheet region of filamentous tau in vivo [<50>] and flank the “PHF6*” sequence that modulates fibrillation rate of recombinant monomeric 4R tau in vitro [<29>, <39>, <64>]. Together these data reveal that PHF-tau is monomethylated in vivo, and that the major occupied sites distribute across protein segments known to mediate tau-protein interactions (including tubulin binding and self association). rhetorical Fig. 1 Summary of modification sites identified by LC–MS/MS on immunopurified PHF-tau.

The relative abundance of ubiquitylation also varied, from 1% (K254) to 33% (K311) (Fig. <2>). These data indicate that Lys modification occupancies are substantial in PHF tau. The sites of monomethylation identified above directly overlapped with sites previously identified as being acetylated in vitro (K174, K180; [<46>]) or ubiquitylated in vivo (K254; [<13>]), raising the issue of competitive crosstalk at these residues. Although no Lys acetylation was detected at these sites in our datasets, it was possible to quantify relative methylation and ubiquitylation of K254. Methylated K254 was identified in Lys-C peptide aa241-254 from manually verified MS/MS spectra (Fig. <3>). Relative to the 1 + charge state y-ions of unmodified aa241–254 peptide (Fig. <3>a), the y-ions of methylated aa241–254 were shifted by +14 Da (Fig. <3>b), reflecting the mass of the methyl group (CH3) added to (and the H atom lost from) the ε-amino group on the K254 side chain. The appearance of the +14 Da shift was not likely an artifact of Fischer esterification (i.e., chemical methylation of free carboxylic acid groups in Asp and Glu; [<32>, <44>]), because all MS/MS spectra were unambiguously assigned by SEQUEST (examples are shown in Supplemental Table 1). Moreover, care was taken to limit Fischer esterification conditions during sample preparation by maintaining the pH of digestion buffers >8, by avoiding exposure of samples to high concentrations of methanol in the presence of acetic acid, and by avoiding methanol as a co-solvent during LC separation of the peptides. rhetorical Fig. 3 MS/MS characterization of K254 modification site.

Trypsin did not cleave ubiquitylated aa243–257 at K254 owing to its conjugation to the C-terminal di-Gly fragment of ubiquitin The sites of monomethylation identified above directly overlapped with sites previously identified as being acetylated in vitro (K174, K180; [<46>]) or ubiquitylated in vivo (K254; [<13>]), raising the issue of competitive crosstalk at these residues.

Ubiquitylated-K254 was identified in tryptic peptide aa243–257, which was resistant to protease cleavage at K254 owing to the isopeptide bond formed between ubiquitin and K254 (Fig. <3>c). When aa241–254 and aa243–257 peptides were subjected to spectral counting, 41% of aa241–254 was monomethylated, whereas only1% of aa243–257 was ubiquitylated (Table <2>; Fig. <2>). These data suggest that monomethylation competes directly with ubiquitylation at K254, and that monomethylation of this site is far more abundant than ubiquitylation in PHF-tau (Fig. <2>, inset). aa Residues Peptide Modification site Spectral count % Modified Modified Un-modified Total 25–44 DQGGYTMHQDQEGDTDAGL K meK44 11 18 29 38% 151–163 IATPRGAAPPGQ K meK163 2 6 8 25% 164–174 GQANATRIPA K meK174 2 n.d. 2 n.d. 175–180 TPPAP K meK180 2 1 3 67% 241–254 SRLQTAPVPMPDL K meK254 17 24 41 41% 243–257 LQTAPVPMPDL K NVK ub-K254 2 188 190 1% 258–267 SKIGSTENL K meK267 6 3 9 67% 281–290 KLDLSNVQS K meK290 2 14 16 12% 299–317 HVPGGGSVQIVY K PVDLSK ub-K311 5 10 15 33% 350–369 VQS K IGSLDNITHVPGGGNK ub-K353 2 49 51 4% Relative abundances of methylated and ubiquitylated PHF-tau peptides as assessed by spectral counts The sites of monomethylation identified above directly overlapped with sites previously identified as being acetylated in vitro (K174, K180; [<46>]) or ubiquitylated in vivo (K254; [<13>]), raising the issue of competitive crosstalk at these residues.

Although several of the monomethylation sites on PHF-tau lie within five amino acid residues of phosphorylation sites identified in the literature [<25>], only one peptide (aa258–267) was detected in our data sets that contained both a methylated lysine and a phosphorylated hydroxy amino acid."

Thus monomethylation at K267 was a more abundant PHF-tau modification than was phosphorylation at S262, with the latter being found more frequently in the presence of K267 methylation than found alone. In AD, PHF-tau accumulates within neurofibrillary lesions associated with neuronal cell bodies (NFTs), neuronal processes (neuropil threads), and the dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques [<8>]. To determine whether tau methylation correlated spatially with neurofibrillary pathology, sections of AD brain hippocampus were probed with a polyclonal antibody that binds meK-containing proteins along with well-characterized monoclonal anti-tau antibodies AT8 and Tau5 [<5>, <43>] in double label format. These tau antibodies were chosen for analysis because their epitopes are present during all phases of NFT development, including the early pre- and intracellular-NFT stages [<60>]. The specificity of the anti-meK reagent was first tested on recombinant 2N4R tau preparations that were subjected to reductive methylation in vitro (see materials and methods). When subjected to SDS-PAGE, both non-methylated and methylated 2N4R tau migrated as single species, with the latter undergoing a band shift to 73 kDa (Fig. <5>a). Rabbit polyclonal anti-meK antibody strongly labeled this species but not nonmethylated 2N4R tau (Fig. <5>b). Binding specificity was further characterized by preadsorption assay, where antibodies were preincubated with 2000-fold molar excess of either non-methylated or methylated 2N4R tau before being used for immunohistochemical labeling of the hippocampal brain sections. When AT8 was preadsorbed under these conditions, neither non-methylated nor methylated tau preparations diminished its reactivity toward neurofibrillary lesions (detected by confocal immunofluorescence microcopy; Fig. <5>c, f). These data were consistent with the established anti-phosphoepitope binding specificity of AT8 [<22>]. Anti-meK antibody also labeled neurofibrillary lesions in these sections, and like AT8, its labeling intensity was not affected by preadsorption with non-methylated 2N4R tau (Fig. <5>d). However, labeling intensity was greatly diminished by pre-adsorption with methylated 2N4R tau (Fig. <5>g). Together these data are consistent with the anti-meK antibody being selective for lysine methylated proteins. rhetorical Fig. 5 Anti-meK antibody specificity. Aliquots of unmodified (−) and in vitro methylated (+) 2N4R tau were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide) and either a stained with Coomassie Blue (500 ng tau proteins), or b subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-meK antibody (100 ng tau protein).

NFT labeling was robust, however, and so colocalization of meK immunoreactivity with this lesion was quantified in hippocampus CA1 region. Results showed that the majority of NFTs labeled with anti-meK antibody in all six cases (Table <4>). Overall, anti-meK colocalization with AT8-labeled NFTs averaged 78 ± 11% (SD, n = 6 cases) whereas colocalization with Tau5-labeled NFTs averaged 79 ± 16% (SD, n = 6 cases).

In particular, the pattern of labeling with NFTs resembled that of Tau5, with fibrillar staining throughout the lesion (Fig. <6>m–o). Although background fluorescence was generally too high to detect neuropil threads with the anti-meK antibody, colocalization with particularly large or intense dystrophic neurites was occasionally seen (Fig. <6>j–l). NFT labeling was robust, however, and so colocalization of meK immunoreactivity with this lesion was quantified in hippocampus CA1 region. Results showed that the majority of NFTs labeled with anti-meK antibody in all six cases (Table <4>). Overall, anti-meK colocalization with AT8-labeled NFTs averaged 78 ± 11% (SD, n = 6 cases) whereas colocalization with Tau5-labeled NFTs averaged 79 ± 16% (SD, n = 6 cases). Together these data show that the methylation of PHF-tau identified through mass spectrometry is widespread in this affected brain region, with most NFTs harboring anti-meK immunoreactivity in late-stage AD. Although certain familial tauopathies result from missense mutations in the tau gene (MAPT), AD pathogenesis is not associated with changes in tau amino acid sequence. Rather, tau lesion formation in sporadic AD is accompanied by PTMs that contribute to pathogenesis by modulating tau function, stability, and aggregation propensity. Because neurofibrillary lesion density correlates with neurodegeneration [<24>, <31>] and cognitive decline [<19>, <20>, <55>], a high priority in the AD field is to identify the PTM signature that drives neurofibrillary lesion formation in sporadic disease. Here we found that PHF-tau isolated from neocortical areas is methylated at at least seven distinct sites, and that the modification is widespread among NFTs in the CA1 region of hippocampus in late stage AD. These findings suggest that tau methylation is a component of the PTM signature associated with PHF-tau.The direct effects of Lys methylation on tau function are not known, but in other proteins this modification is reported to modulate protein–protein interaction by increasing the interaction radius of Lys side chains [<34>] and by increasing the entropic driving force for its burial away from solvent [<62>]."
PMC3249157_7,"For these reasons, reductive methylation is used to improve the performance of protein crystallization in preparation for diffraction experiments [<34>]  The localization of methylated residues within the microtubule binding repeat region in proximity to the PHF6 and PHF6* nucleation centers makes Lys methylation a candidate modification for directly affecting normal tau interactions with binding partners such as microtubules as well as abnormal interactions such as aggregation and PHF formation.In addition to direct effects, Lys methylation also may modulate protein function through cross-talk with other PTMs. In its simplest form, crosstalk involves direct competition for occupancy of any single amino acid residue side chain. Here we found that K254 from PHF-tau isolated from AD brains was either ubiquitylated or methylated, with the latter strongly predominating. These data indicate that K254 methylation must occur at the expense of ubiquitylation, and thus is a candidate modification for regulating protein degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system [<46>].A second, more complex paradigm of crosstalk involves interactions between separate amino acid residues, where modification of one residue alters the ability of a second residue to bind its modifying enzyme. For example, tau phosphorylated by the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (PAR1/MARK2) is not recognized by the CHIP/Hsp90 E3 ligase complex and thus fails to be ubiquitylated or degraded [<15>]. Conversely, tau requires phosphorylation by GSK3β for efficient recognition and ubiquitylation by the CHIP/Hsp90 complex [<61>]. Here we found that K267 is methylated in PHF-tau, and that phosphorylation of S262 appears more frequently on peptides containing methylated rather than non-methylated K267. This observation raises the possibility of crosstalk between S262 phosphorylation, which strongly reduces the binding of tau to microtubules [<4>, <58>], and K267 methylation. The impaired microtubule-binding phenotype associated with S262 phosphorylation may be important for AD pathogenesis since this site is occupied early in NFT formation [<2>]. Other sites of phosphorylation identified previously in PHF-tau [<25>] (but not found in our datasets) also lie within close proximity to methylation sites. These include T175, T181, S184, S185, S258, and S289. Moreover, one projection domain methylation site, K44, is adjacent to a predicted calpain-catalyzed cleavage site in tau [<52>]. These data suggest that tau methylation is positioned to potentially engage in cross talk with multiple post translational modifications. It will be important to establish the temporal relationship among these modifications and the aggregation of tau during neurofibrillary lesion formation in AD. Mass spectrometry can complement high throughput immunohistochemical detection methods, which are sensitive to modification context [<16>], in this effort. Previous characterization of PHFs prepared by differential centrifugation using amino acid analysis reported a low unmodified Lys content relative to predicted tau composition, consistent with extensive Lys modification, but failed to detect meK [<42>]. The source of this discrepancy is not clear, but may relate to the sensitivity of amino acid analysis relative to MS and to the purity of the PHF preparations used for study.Two recent studies reported that tau can be acetylated on Lys in vitro, resulting in increased aggregation propensity and inhibition of tau degradation [<11>, <46>]. In vivo acetylation of K163, K174, K180 and K280 and accumulation within PHF-tau was claimed on the basis of antibody-based methods in tissue sections prepared from AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases [<11>, <46>]. On the basis of MS analysis, we did not detect tau acetylation even though residues K163, K174, K180 and K280 were resolved within our coverage area. These discrepancies could arise from any of several possibilities. One is that methylation occurs to a greater extent than acetylation. Consistent with this model, we found that K163, K174, and K180 were modified in PHF, but by monomethylation rather than acetylation. Combined with our detection of Lys ubiquitylation, these data suggest that the relative abundances of Lys methylation and ubiquitylation are likely higher than Lys acetylation in the PHF-tau preparation used herein. Another possibility is that PHF-tau contains substantial acetylation, but at sites distinct from those identified in vitro or that reside within our current coverage area. Additional analysis of PHF will be required to test this hypothesis. A third possibility is that immunopurified PHF represents a subfraction of tau aggregates with greater SDS-solubililty. For example, we find ([<13>]; Fig. <1>) that immunopurified PHFs lack detectable phosphorylation at T175 and T181 that were reported qualitatively by others in some tissue/PHF preparations [<2>, <21>, <26>]. In addition, Y394 phosphorylation has been reported in PHF-tau [<14>, <63>], but this modification is present at rather low relative abundance in the PHF-tau preparation used herein. It should be possible to resolve these possibilities in the future using mass spectrometry under conditions that provide quantitative information on modification occupancy.In conclusion, we report biophysical evidence that seven Lys residues (K44, K163, K174, K180, K254, K267, and K290) in PHF-tau immunopurified from AD brain are monomethylated. The sites present opportunities for cross talk with other PTMs, including direct competition with ubiquitylation and acetylation, and indirect interaction with phosphorylation and proteolysis. It will be important to determine the functional and temporal relationships among these established modifications in modulating the accumulation of PHF-tau in AD and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material. In sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neurofibrillary lesion formation is preceded by extensive post-translational modification of the microtubule associated protein tau. To identify the modification signature associated with tau lesion formation at single amino acid resolution, immunopurified paired helical filaments were isolated from AD brain and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The resulting spectra identified monomethylation of lysine residues as a new tau modification. The methyl-lysine was distributed among seven residues located in the projection and microtubule binding repeat regions of tau protein, with one site, K254, being a substrate for a competing lysine modification, ubiquitylation. To characterize methyl lysine content in intact tissue, hippocampal sections prepared from post mortem late-stage AD cases were subjected to double-label confocal fluorescence microscopy using anti-tau and anti-methyl lysine antibodies. Anti-methyl lysine immunoreactivity colocalized with 78 ± 13% of neurofibrillary tangles in these specimens. Together these data provide the first evidence that tau in neurofibrillary lesions is post-translationally modified by lysine methylation.

PMC3044115_0,"The R406W mutation prevents tau from functioning as a linker between the membrane and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Changes of the microtubule-associated protein tau are central in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). However, the functional consequence of the FTDP-17 tau mutation R406W, which causes a tauopathy clinically resembling AD, is not well understood. We find that the R406W mutation does not affect microtubule interaction but abolishes tau’s membrane binding. Loss of binding is associated with decreased trapping at the tip of neurites and increased length fluctuations during process growth. Tandem affinity purification tag purification and mass spectrometry identify the calcium-regulated plasma membrane–binding protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) as a potential interaction partner of tau. Consistently, wild-type tau but not R406W tau interacts with AnxA2 in a heterologous yeast expression system. Sequestration of Ca2+ or knockdown of AnxA2 abolishes the differential trapping of wild-type and R406W tau. We suggest that the pathological effect of the R406W mutation is caused by impaired membrane binding, which involves a functional interaction with AnxA2 as a membrane–cytoskeleton linker.

We also thank Dr. Michael Kemper for helpful suggestions on the manuscript. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second or third most common dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and it comprises 3–10% of all neurodegenerative dementias (<Yoshiyama et al., 2001>). 30–50% of persons with FTD have a positive family history, and mutations in the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau are responsible for a large proportion of familial FTD cases. Several FTD cases have been linked genetically to chromosome 17q21-22 and have been referred to as “frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17” (<Foster et al., 1997>). According to a large population-based study in the Netherlands, three distinct mutations (G272V, P301L, and R406W) account for 16% of familial FTD cases (<Rizzu et al., 1999>).Most families with FTDP-17 show deposits of tau in neurons or in glial cells. In some families, the tau deposits are identical to those present in AD (<Spillantini et al., 1996>) and consist of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the cell soma. Why the MAP tau, which is normally enriched in the axon, redistributes to the somatodendritic compartment during disease is still a matter of debate. In AD, it has been shown that pathologically increased amounts of amyloid β (Aβ), a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), trigger an increased phosphorylation of tau (<Busciglio et al., 1995>; <Leschik et al., 2007>; <Tackenberg and Brandt, 2009>). Because hyperphosphorylated tau exhibits a reduced binding to microtubules, this may result in a loss of tau’s axon-specific localization, thus triggering the pathological cascade.With respect to the underlying molecular mechanism, the exonic FTDP-17 mutation R406W is most interesting because it causes an early onset tauopathy that clinically closely resembles AD and is often misdiagnosed as such (<Ostojic et al., 2004>; <Ikeuchi et al., 2008>; <Lindquist et al., 2008>). Why the R406W mutation leads to pathological changes in the absence of increased Aβ is unknown.Overexpression of R406W tau in transgenic mice causes age-dependent accumulation of tau aggregates in neuronal perikarya, a reduction of the amount of tau in the axon, and induction of neurodegeneration (<Zhang et al., 2004>). All of these features have also been reported in AD mouse models (<Götz and Ittner, 2008>). However, in contrast to hyperphosphorylated tau in models of AD, the R406W mutation does not significantly alter the ability of tau to regulate microtubule dynamics (<Bunker et al., 2006>). This is consistent with the finding that soluble R406W tau from the brain of FTDP-17 patients is not hyperphosphorylated but is rather hypophosphorylated as compared with tau from healthy subjects (<Miyasaka et al., 2001>). Several studies also found that R406W tau does not differ from wild-type (wt) tau in its ability to form filaments in vitro (<Aoyagi et al., 2007>; <Chang et al., 2008>). These findings suggest that features other than the perturbation of microtubule binding or filament formation are responsible for the redistribution of R406W tau to the somatodendritic compartment in the development of tau pathology.We have previously shown that tau binds to the axonal membrane cortex through its amino terminal projection domain (<Brandt et al., 1995>). Binding of tau to the membrane was sensitive to phosphorylation and was abolished after experimental hyperphosphorylation of tau (<Maas et al., 2000>; <Eidenmüller et al., 2001>). We have also provided evidence that tau is trapped in the distal axon mediated by its membrane binding. This trapping is abolished in the presence of Aβ or at increased tau phosphorylation (<Weissmann et al., 2009>). It can thus be hypothesized that the R406W mutation decreases the interaction of the mutant protein with the membrane much like an Aβ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation, thereby causing a loss of axonal localization.To scrutinize functional consequences of the R406W mutation, we expressed epitope-tagged human tau constructs in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells. We determined the phosphorylation profile using a panel of phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies and analyzed tau distribution using fluorescence decay after photoactivation. Binding to the membrane cortex was determined by subcellular fractionation of surface-biotinylated cells, and potential tau interaction partners were identified by tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag purification and mass spectrometry (MS). To determine functional consequences of the FTDP-17 mutation R406W in the MAP tau, a panel of epitope-tagged human tau variants with or without the R406W mutation in the carboxy-terminal nonmicrotubule binding region were produced (<Fig. 1>). The constructs were based on the shortest isoform of tau coding for 352 aa and the longest human central nervous system isoform (441 aa) containing also the adult-specific exons 2, 3, and 10 (to allow for an easy reference to previous work, the numbering of the mutated site and the phosphorylation epitopes is based on the tau isoform containing 441 aa). For immunological detection and use in live cell imaging, the short (8 aa) FLAG-sequence and three longer fluorescent tags (EGFP, photoactivatable GFP [PAGFP], and mRFP) were used. The tags were fused to the amino termini of the tau variants because additional amino-terminal sequences do not interfere with the interaction of tau with microtubules or membrane components (<Brandt et al., 1995>; <Maas et al., 2000>). rhetorical Figure 1.

Numbers to the sides of the gel blots indicate molecular mass standards in kilodaltons. To determine functional consequences of the FTDP-17 mutation R406W in the MAP tau, a panel of epitope-tagged human tau variants with or without the R406W mutation in the carboxy-terminal nonmicrotubule binding region were produced (<Fig. 1>). The constructs were based on the shortest isoform of tau coding for 352 aa and the longest human central nervous system isoform (441 aa) containing also the adult-specific exons 2, 3, and 10 (to allow for an easy reference to previous work, the numbering of the mutated site and the phosphorylation epitopes is based on the tau isoform containing 441 aa). For immunological detection and use in live cell imaging, the short (8 aa) FLAG-sequence and three longer fluorescent tags (EGFP, photoactivatable GFP [PAGFP], and mRFP) were used. The tags were fused to the amino termini of the tau variants because additional amino-terminal sequences do not interfere with the interaction of tau with microtubules or membrane components (<Brandt et al., 1995>; <Maas et al., 2000>).The constructs were expressed in PC12 cells as a model for neural cells (<Fig. 1 A>; <Greene et al., 1991>). In immunoblots of lysates of transfected PC12 cells, the proteins separated at apparent molecular masses of 50–55 kD and 65–70 kD (FLAG-tagged 352 and 441 tau, respectively) and 75–80 kD (PAGFP-, EGFP-, and mRFP-tagged 352 tau). The electrophoretic mobility was lower than would be expected from the calculated molecular weight, which is in agreement with earlier studies (<Maas et al., 2000>; <Weissmann et al., 2009>). It was evident that wt tau separated as a single band, whereas the respective R406W mutated protein separated as a doublet, with one band having a higher electrophoretic mobility (<Fig. 1 A>, right, arrow versus arrowhead). This may indicate the presence of a population with reduced phosphorylation in R406W tau because it is known that phosphorylation leads to detergent-resistant conformational domains in tau protein, which result in decreased electrophoretic mobility. Transient or stable expression of the R406W mutant did not result in obvious phenotypic alterations of undifferentiated PC12 cells, and comparable amounts of the constructs were expressed (<Fig. 1 B>). Tauopathies are thought to be associated with increased phosphorylation of tau protein (<Stoothoff and Johnson, 2005>). However, with respect to the R406W mutation, both increased and decreased phosphorylation of tau have been described depending on the cell system used (<Krishnamurthy and Johnson, 2004>).To determine the effect of the R406W mutation on the phosphorylation profile of tau in PC12 cells, lysates of cells that stably expressed FLAG-tagged wt tau or R406W tau were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting with phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies. As a loading control, blots were also stained with the phosphorylation-independent Tau5 antibody, which detects all tau isoforms (<Fig. 1 C>). Some of the phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies (pT205, pT212, pS214, and PHF1) preferentially detected the R406W tau band with the lower electrophoretic mobility (i.e., the upper band), which confirms that the reduced electrophoretic mobility of wt tau is caused by a higher phosphorylation state. No difference was observed with an antibody that detected a dephosphorylated epitope (Tau1). The quantification of all immunoreactive bands revealed that the R406W mutation exhibits a decreased phosphorylation at T205, T212, and the PHF1 epitope (S396/S404; reductions of 40–65%) as compared with wt tau, whereas other sites were not affected or only slightly affected (T181, S199, S214, and S262). We did not observe an increased phosphorylation of R406W tau at any of the sites analyzed. To determine whether the presence of the adult-specific exons affects phosphorylation, quantitative immunoblotting was also performed with lysates expressing the 441 tau isoforms using some of the phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies. Again, we did not observe a change with the Tau1 antibody, whereas phosphorylation was strongly decreased at T205, T212, and the PHF1 epitope (reductions of 40–80%; <Fig. 1 D>).The data indicate that in PC12 cells, R406W tau is less phosphorylated at several disease-relevant sites than the wt protein. During tauopathies, tau may change or lose its interaction with microtubules, which in turn may affect its distribution within neurons.To assess this interaction for the R406W mutation, we transiently expressed fluorescently tagged tau constructs in PC12 cells, induced a neuronal phenotype by treatment with NGF, and performed a combined fixation–extraction protocol to visualize microtubule-associated tau protein (<Fig. 2 A>, left). We observed that wt tau and R406W tau exhibited a very similar filamentous staining pattern indicative of binding to microtubules. Both proteins were enriched in neurites and were also present in filamentous structures in growth cones (<Fig. 2 A>, left, arrowheads and insets). When wt tau and R406W tau were coexpressed in the same cell, no difference in the distribution was observed, as indicated by the yellow color in the overlay (<Fig. 2 A>, right). This suggests that both wt tau and R406W tau bind to the same microtubule subpopulations in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. rhetorical Figure 2.

This suggests that both wt tau and R406W tau bind to the same microtubule subpopulations in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells.It is known that binding of tau to microtubules results in increased microtubule stability, which is manifested by a higher ratio of acetylated/total tubulin (<Piperno et al., 1987>). To determine the degree of microtubule stabilization, lysates from cells that stably expressed FLAG-tagged wt tau and R406W tau were analyzed by immunoblotting and compared with control cells. Immunodetection used antibodies against tau, acetylated tubulin, and total α-tubulin (<Fig. 2 B>, left). Quantification revealed that wt tau and R406W tau expression led to an ∼30% increase in microtubule stability as compared with control cells (<Fig. 2 B>, right). No difference was observed between wt tau and R406W tau–expressing cells, again indicating that both proteins bind to the same extent to microtubules. Thus, the data indicate that despite its decreased phosphorylation, R406W tau does not enhance microtubule stabilization.It is possible that wt tau and R406W tau bind in a different manner to microtubules, which could for example result in a displacement of mutant tau by wt tau from microtubules. To explore this hypothesis, we determined the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) of PAGFP-tau in neurites when coexpressed with mRFP-wt tau, mRFP-R406W tau, or the fluorescence tag alone. The distribution of focally activated PAGFP-tau (PAGFP*-tau) was recorded over time (<Fig. 3 A>). The fluorescence decay in the activated region was then plotted against the time, and Deff was calculated as described previously using a modeling approach (<Fig. 3 B>; <Weissmann et al., 2009>). We did not find any difference in the Deff of wt tau and R406W after coexpression with the fluorescence tag (mRFP) alone, which confirms that both proteins bind to microtubules to a similar extent (<Fig. 3 C>). The percentage of microtubule-bound tau can be calculated from Df/Deff = 1 + K*, with K* as the ratio of bound/free molecules (<Sprague et al., 2004>) and the diffusion coefficient of 3×PAGFP as a nonbinding control (Df = 6.3 µm2/s; <Weissmann et al., 2009>). These calculations indicated that the majority of wt tau and R406W tau (87% and 88%, respectively) was associated with microtubules in the neurites. Coexpression of mRFP-labeled tau constructs with PAGFP-tagged tau resulted in a decrease of Deff by 40–60%, probably caused by increased molecular crowding on the microtubules. We did not observe an obvious difference in the Deff of wt tau when coexpressed with the same construct or with R406W tau, or of R406W tau when coexpressed with the same construct or wt tau. This indicates that wt tau does not displace R406W tau from the surface of microtubules, or vice versa, and suggests that both proteins interact with microtubules in a very similar manner. rhetorical Figure 3.

(C) Effective diffusion coefficients for PAGFP-tau in different combinations of coexpression.

Coexpression of tau constructs reduces the diffusion similarly for wt and R406W tau. Values are shown as mean ± SEM from fits of n processes. Experiments were performed with the 352 tau isoform. During tauopathies, tau may change or lose its interaction with microtubules, which in turn may affect its distribution within neurons.To assess this interaction for the R406W mutation, we transiently expressed fluorescently tagged tau constructs in PC12 cells, induced a neuronal phenotype by treatment with NGF, and performed a combined fixation–extraction protocol to visualize microtubule-associated tau protein (<Fig. 2 A>, left).

To explore this hypothesis, we determined the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) of PAGFP-tau in neurites when coexpressed with mRFP-wt tau, mRFP-R406W tau, or the fluorescence tag alone. The distribution of focally activated PAGFP-tau (PAGFP*-tau) was recorded over time (<Fig. 3 A>). The fluorescence decay in the activated region was then plotted against the time, and Deff was calculated as described previously using a modeling approach (<Fig. 3 B>; <Weissmann et al., 2009>)."
PMC3044115_3,"We did not find any difference in the Deff of wt tau and R406W after coexpression with the fluorescence tag (mRFP) alone, which confirms that both proteins bind to microtubules to a similar extent (<Fig  3 C>). The percentage of microtubule-bound tau can be calculated from Df/Deff = 1 + K*, with K* as the ratio of bound/free molecules (<Sprague et al., 2004>) and the diffusion coefficient of 3×PAGFP as a nonbinding control (Df = 6.3 µm2/s; <Weissmann et al., 2009>). These calculations indicated that the majority of wt tau and R406W tau (87% and 88%, respectively) was associated with microtubules in the neurites. Coexpression of mRFP-labeled tau constructs with PAGFP-tagged tau resulted in a decrease of Deff by 40–60%, probably caused by increased molecular crowding on the microtubules. We did not observe an obvious difference in the Deff of wt tau when coexpressed with the same construct or with R406W tau, or of R406W tau when coexpressed with the same construct or wt tau. This indicates that wt tau does not displace R406W tau from the surface of microtubules, or vice versa, and suggests that both proteins interact with microtubules in a very similar manner.Collectively, the data indicate that the R406W mutation does not affect tau-dependent microtubule stabilization or the interaction of tau with microtubules in living cells. We have previously shown that tau interacts with the neural membrane cortex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<Brandt et al., 1995>; <Maas et al., 2000>). Tau’s association with the membrane cortex may play an important role in the axonal localization of tau and may contribute to the trapping of tau in distal processes (<Weissmann et al., 2009>).To determine whether the R406W mutation affects the association of tau with the membrane cortex, cell fractionations were used to enrich plasma membranes and proteins of the associated membrane cortex (PM fraction). The protocol is based on magnetic sphere separation of surface-biotinylated cells that were homogenized at mild conditions (<Fig. 4 A>). With this method, a PM fraction, which contains ∼30–35% of the total cellular actin, is obtained, indicating the presence of the actin-rich membrane cortex. This fraction is devoid of tubulin, which behaves as a soluble cytosolic protein under the conditions of fractionation (<Fig. 4 B>). In agreement with previous results (<Maas et al., 2000>), ∼20–30% of total wt tau was present in the PM fraction as detected with antibodies against total tau (Tau5) and a dephosphorylated tau epitope (Tau1). In contrast to wt tau, R406W tau was completely absent from the PM fraction. Quantification of the Tau5 blot revealed that the percentage of the tau signal in the organelle/membrane fraction was similar for R406W tau and wt tau (27% and 22%, respectively), whereas the percentage of cytosolic R406W tau was much higher (73% and 52% for R406W tau and wt tau, respectively). This suggests that the nonplasma membrane-bound R406W tau is instead present in the cytosol. Thus, the data suggest that the R406W mutation abolishes tau’s association with the membrane cortex and increases the amount of tau in the cytosolic fraction. rhetorical Figure 4.

In fact, PAGFP*-wt tau showed a clear enrichment at the periphery, which suggests its membrane association, whereas PAGFP*-R406W tau exhibited a uniform distribution within the process (<Fig. 4 C>). To determine whether the difference in membrane binding affects trapping of tau in neurites, we photoactivated wt tau and R406W tau in the tip of a neurite and followed its distribution over time. It was evident from the color-coded plots of 2D intensity functions that PAGFP*-R406W dissipated faster from the activation spot than PAGFP*-wt tau (<Fig. 5 A>). For quantification of the extent of trapping, the fraction of tau in the activated spot was compared with total tau (It/Itot) at different time points after activation. We observed that It/Itot was significantly higher for wt tau as compared with R406W tau (<Fig. 5 B>). This indicates a preferential trapping of wt tau in agreement with its ability to interact with the plasma membrane. We determined the effective diffusion constants for wt and R406W tau after activation in the tip by taking into account that diffusion is restricted to one direction. Deff in the tip was less than half for wt tau compared with R406W tau (<Fig. 5 C>) and compared with the diffusion of tau in the shaft (see <Fig. 3>). The data suggest that tau’s membrane association causes retention of tau in the tip of neurites, which is compromised by the R406W mutation. rhetorical Figure 5.

With this approach, the calcium-regulated membrane and microfilament-interacting protein AnxA2 was identified as a prominent component of a tau-containing complex (<Fig. 7 A>). To test for a direct interaction between tau and AnxA2, we performed yeast two-hybrid experiments with human wt tau, R406W tau, and human AnxA2. None of the tested combinations displayed any interaction (unpublished data). Thus, either tau and AnxA2 do not directly interact, or the interaction may not occur within the yeast nuclear environment (e.g., because of the absence of suitable membrane components or an inappropriate Ca2+ concentration). To test for interaction of AnxA2 and tau in PC12 cells, cellular lysates were prepared and PAGFP-tau was precipitated using a GFP-trap in the presence of NP-40. We did not detect endogenous AnxA2 coprecipitating with human tau when the experiments were performed in the absence of Ca2+ (unpublished data).Unfortunately, the presence of Ca2+ resulted in the precipitation of AnxA2 even at control conditions (PAGFP alone; unpublished data), probably because of the formation of unspecific complexes in the presence of neural membrane components. To overcome this limitation, we coexpressed human tau with GFP-tagged human AnxA2 in the heterologous yeast system. The proteins were clearly produced and present in crude extracts (<Fig. 7 B>, input). In pull-down assays in the presence of Ca2+, between 25 and 40% wt tau coprecipitated with AnxA2, whereas R406W tau remained completely in the supernatant (<Fig. 7 B>, top).

For these experiments, cells that stably expressed wt tau or R406W tau were infected with lentivirus encoding AnxA2 shRNA or a control shRNA. Infected cells were selected with puromycin. Western blot analysis showed that the amount of AnxA2 strongly decreased to 21.7 ± 5.5% (n = 4) with AnxA2 shRNA, whereas only minor changes were observed when the cells were treated with the control shRNA (<Fig. 9 A>). Consequently, a strong reduction of annexin staining was also observed by immunocytochemistry (<Fig. 9 B>). It should be noted that tau levels were approximately twice as high in cells that have been treated with AnxA2 shRNA compared with untreated cells. We also observed that treatment with the control shRNA increased the amount of tau to a similar extent, which indicates that the changes in tau expression are related to the puromycin treatment during the selection and not to AnxA2 knockdown. rhetorical Figure 9.

PMC3044115_7,"We observed that a significant amount of AnxA2 was retained together with tau in the cell body, neurites of differentiated PC12 cells (<Fig  8 B>), and axons of primary cortical cultures (<Fig. 8 C>), confirming that tau and AnxA2 are present in the same compartment and associate with cytoskeletal structures.To test for a functional interaction between tau and annexin in neurites, we knocked down AnxA2 in PC12 cells by small hairpin RNA (shRNA). For these experiments, cells that stably expressed wt tau or R406W tau were infected with lentivirus encoding AnxA2 shRNA or a control shRNA. Infected cells were selected with puromycin. Western blot analysis showed that the amount of AnxA2 strongly decreased to 21.7 ± 5.5% (n = 4) with AnxA2 shRNA, whereas only minor changes were observed when the cells were treated with the control shRNA (<Fig. 9 A>). Consequently, a strong reduction of annexin staining was also observed by immunocytochemistry (<Fig. 9 B>). It should be noted that tau levels were approximately twice as high in cells that have been treated with AnxA2 shRNA compared with untreated cells. We also observed that treatment with the control shRNA increased the amount of tau to a similar extent, which indicates that the changes in tau expression are related to the puromycin treatment during the selection and not to AnxA2 knockdown.The effect of AnxA2 knockdown on tau trapping was then analyzed after photoactivation of tau in the tip of neurites. We observed that the difference in the retention of wt tau and R406W tau was abolished after annexin knockdown (<Fig. 9 C>). In agreement, Deff in the tip was much lower for wt tau compared with R406W tau after infection with the control shRNA, whereas it was similar in AnxA2 shRNA–treated cells (<Fig. 9 C>, right).Because it is known that binding of AnxA2 to membranes requires calcium (<Gerke and Moss, 2002>; <Gerke et al., 2005>), we treated cells expressing wt tau or R406W tau (in the absence of shRNA) with the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA/AM to interfere with the annexin–membrane interaction. Also, after BAPTA treatment, the difference in the retention of wt tau and R406W tau was abolished (<Fig. 9 D>), which again suggests that tau trapping is caused by an interaction with AnxA2 at the membrane.If AnxA2 causes retention of wt tau due to a functional interaction in the tip of processes, it may be expected that, in turn, wt tau expression reduces the mobility of AnxA2 in growth cones. To test this hypothesis, we prepared an AnxA2–PAGFP fusion construct and expressed it in PC12 cells. An immunoblot of cellular lysates confirmed that the full-length construct was expressed in infected cells in addition to endogenous annexin (<Fig. 10 A>). We observed that AnxA2–PAGFP was distributed in the cytosol and the processes and showed an enrichment at the tip of neurites similar to endogenous AnxA2 (<Fig. 10 B>, compare with <Fig. 8 A>). Wt tau colocalized with AnxA2–PAGFP at the tip while R406W tau was absent. To test whether tau expression affects the mobility of AnxA2, we performed fluorescence decay after photoactivation experiments where AnxA2–PAGFP was activated at the tip of the processes and its dissipation followed over time. We observed that wt tau expression caused an increased retention of AnxA2–PAGFP* in the tip compared with R406W tau–expressing or untransfected control cells (<Fig. 10 C>). rhetorical Figure 10.

Endogenous annexin is indicated by the arrowhead. Tubulin is stained as loading control. (B) Fluorescence micrographs of PC12 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wt tau or R406W tau after infection with a lentivirus encoding AnxA2–PAGFP. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with antibodies against GFP (for AnxA2–PAGFP) and the FLAG-epitope (for tau). Close-ups of the tips of processes are shown on the right. Note that AnxA2–PAGFP showed an enrichment at the tip of neurites similar to endogenous AnxA2. Wt tau colocalized with AnxA2–PAGFP at the tip while R406W tau was absent (arrowheads). Bar, 10 µm. (C) Retention of AnxA2–PAGFP at the tip of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wt tau, R406W tau, or control cells. Note the increased retention of AnxA2–PAGFP* in wt tau, but not in R406W tau–expressing cells or control cells. Values are shown as mean ± SEM (error bars). ***, P < 0.001; *, P < 0.05 (n = 6–27). Experiments were performed with the 352 tau isoform. Because the wt protein associates with the membrane cortex, in contrast to R406W tau, we performed TAP tag MS of tau-transfected neural cells to identify membranous or membrane-associated proteins as potential tau interaction partners. To solubilize the membrane, lysates were prepared at low detergent concentrations (0.15% NP-40). With this approach, the calcium-regulated membrane and microfilament-interacting protein AnxA2 was identified as a prominent component of a tau-containing complex (<Fig. 7 A>). To test for a direct interaction between tau and AnxA2, we performed yeast two-hybrid experiments with human wt tau, R406W tau, and human AnxA2. None of the tested combinations displayed any interaction (unpublished data). Thus, either tau and AnxA2 do not directly interact, or the interaction may not occur within the yeast nuclear environment (e.g., because of the absence of suitable membrane components or an inappropriate Ca2+ concentration). To test for interaction of AnxA2 and tau in PC12 cells, cellular lysates were prepared and PAGFP-tau was precipitated using a GFP-trap in the presence of NP-40. We did not detect endogenous AnxA2 coprecipitating with human tau when the experiments were performed in the absence of Ca2+ (unpublished data).Unfortunately, the presence of Ca2+ resulted in the precipitation of AnxA2 even at control conditions (PAGFP alone; unpublished data), probably because of the formation of unspecific complexes in the presence of neural membrane components. To overcome this limitation, we coexpressed human tau with GFP-tagged human AnxA2 in the heterologous yeast system. The proteins were clearly produced and present in crude extracts (<Fig. 7 B>, input). In pull-down assays in the presence of Ca2+, between 25 and 40% wt tau coprecipitated with AnxA2, whereas R406W tau remained completely in the supernatant (<Fig. 7 B>, top). Copreciptation occurred with both the 352 and the 441 wt tau isoform, indicating that the additional exons were not required for the interaction with AnxA2. In control experiments where GFP was coexpressed with the tau constructs, neither 352 nor 441 tau precipitated. Thus, the data indicate that in a heterologous yeast system, AnxA2 and tau specifically interact.To test whether tau and annexin could also interact in neural cells, we performed colocalization experiments in differentiated PC12 cells and primary cortical cultures. Endogenous AnxA2 was present in the cell body and in processes, where it showed enrichment in distal tips (<Fig. 8 A>). Transfected tau was also present in the cell body, the neurites, and the tip of processes. In growth cones, we observed colocalization of tau and AnxA2 in filamentous structures (<Fig. 8 A>, insets), which is consistent with a tau–annexin interaction in this region. To test for interaction with cytoskeletal structures, we performed a combined fixation–extraction protocol.

We observed that wt tau expression caused an increased retention of AnxA2–PAGFP* in the tip compared with R406W tau–expressing or untransfected control cells (<Fig. 10 C>).Collectively, the data indicate that wt tau but not R406W tau functionally interact with AnxA2 in neural growth cones and suggest that this interaction regulates the distribution of both proteins. We have shown that the R406W FTD tau mutation abolishes the ability of tau to interact with the neural membrane cortex and reduces trapping of tau in the tip of neuron-like processes. In contrast, microtubule-related features such as the activity to stabilize microtubules or the extent and dynamics of microtubule binding in neuronal processes were unaffected by the mutation. Previously, it had been shown that some FTDP-17 mutations compromised tau’s ability to affect microtubule dynamics, whereas the R406W mutation did not alter microtubule-related activities (<Bunker et al., 2006>) and was indistinguishable in the colocalization pattern with microtubules (<DeTure et al., 2000>). This is consistent with the idea that at least some FTDP-17 mutations affect other activities of tau rather than binding to microtubules. It will be interesting to determine whether other tau mutations that have been frequently observed in FTDP-17 cases such as G272V and P301L also influence tau’s interaction with annexin.The R406W mutation reduced rather than increased phosphorylation at several positions, including the PHF1 epitope (S396/S404), T212, and T205. Decreased phosphorylation of R406W tau at several sites has also been reported earlier in different cellular systems (<Dayanandan et al., 1999>; <Matsumura et al., 1999>; <Vogelsberg-Ragaglia et al., 2000>; <DeTure et al., 2002>; <Tackenberg and Brandt, 2009>). Among others, all of these sites can be phosphorylated in vitro by the kinases Cdk5 and GSK3β, both of which have been implicated as having a role in AD (<Cruz and Tsai, 2004>; <Hooper et al., 2008>). The data presented here also indicate that phosphorylation at these positions does not affect tau’s ability to stabilize microtubules. This is in agreement with the finding that the extent of phosphorylation at Ser262, which is located within the microtubule-binding region and known to critically affect tau’s microtubule interaction (<Biernat et al., 1993>), was not significantly changed in the R406W variant. However, it is possible that the changes in the phosphorylation profile that are induced by the R406W mutation induce more subtle changes with respect to tau’s microtubule-related activities.On first view, it appears surprising that a mutation in tau’s carboxy-terminal region selectively affects a feature that is known to be mediated by the opposite side of the molecule, the amino-terminal projection domain of tau. However, it has been shown previously that tau can adopt a “paperclip” conformation, in which the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains approach each other (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>). Furthermore, MS analysis of the phosphorylation pattern suggested that the R406W mutation exerts long-range conformational effects on the structure of tau (<Connell et al., 2001>), which could explain an effect of the carboxy-terminal mutation on the amino-terminal domain. This is also consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of T205 and T212 in R406W tau compared with wt tau, residues that are both located in the amino-terminal half of the protein. Previously, we have observed similar and selective long-range effects when we analyzed the influence of phosphorylation on tau’s ability to interact with the membrane cortex. We found that pseudophosphorylation in tau’s carboxy terminus abolished tau’s interaction with the membrane cortex, whereas tau’s ability to promote microtubule assembly was unchanged (<Eidenmüller et al., 2001>).What is the functional role of tau’s interaction with the membrane. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of tau’s amino terminus inhibits process outgrowth in cells (<Brandt et al., 1995>), and suggested that tau’s membrane interaction supports process formation that is competitively suppressed by the amino-terminal fragment. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found here that R406W tau–expressing cells showed higher fluctuations in process extension compared with wt tau, which may suggest that tau’s membrane interaction supports stable process growth, presumably by bridging the growing microtubules to the membrane cortex in the growth cone. Our data suggest that this bridging is mediated by AnxA2 (see the following paragraph). It has been reported that AnxA2 is up-regulated during NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (<Schlaepfer and Haigler, 1990>; <Fox et al., 1991>), which parallels the increased expression of tau (<Drubin et al., 1988>). This would be consistent with an involvement of both proteins in regulating neurite outgrowth (<Fox et al., 1991>; <Jacovina et al., 2001>). Very recently, it has been reported that tau affects neurite initiation without requirement for microtubule binding (<Leugers and Lee, 2010>). It is conceivable that tau’s association with the membrane cortex is also involved in this activity.Several lines of evidence reported here support the finding that tau interacts with AnxA2. (a) Annexin A2 was identified as an interacting protein using a TAP tag approach with tau as a bait. (b) Tau coprecipitated with AnxA2 in a heterologous yeast expression system."
PMC3044115_9,"(c) Tau and AnxA2 colocalized in neuronally differentiated cells, and we observed colocalization of tau and AnxA2 in filamentous structures in the growth cones  (d) shRNA-mediated AnxA2 knockdown abolished trapping of tau in the tip of neurites. (e) Chelation of Ca2+ ions by treatment with BAPTA/AM, which is known to remove annexin from the plasma membrane, increases the mobility of tau in the tip of neurites. (f) Expression of tau increases the retention of AnxA2 in distal processes. Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-regulated membrane-binding proteins, which are expressed in most eukaryotic cell types and species (<Gerke and Moss, 2002>). In vertebrates, 12 subfamilies are expressed, termed A1–11 and A13 (<Morgan and Fernández, 1997>). The annexins share a core domain, which serves as a general membrane-binding module consisting of four α-helical annexin repeats and an amino-terminal head region of various lengths, which extends into the cytosol (<Rescher and Gerke, 2004>). Annexin A2 is mainly localized at the plasma membrane and the N-terminal domain modulates its membrane binding activity (<Gerke and Moss, 2002>). Plasma membrane binding is reversible and chelation of calcium results in liberation of AnxA2 from the membrane. Thus, the localization and distribution of AnxA2 may be determined by differential intracellular calcium concentrations in the cell (<Gerke and Moss, 1997>). Ca2+-regulated membrane binding of AnxA2 could also provide a mechanism to localize tau in an activity-dependent manner to the presynaptic region, thus regulating microtubule dynamics in parallel to the firing of a synapse.Mice lacking AnxA2 show no obvious phenotypic change. Therefore, it has been proposed that other annexins can compensate for a functional loss of AnxA2 in a knockout scenario (<Rescher and Gerke, 2004>). Thus, transient down-regulation by RNA interference or expression of dominant interfering mutants may be more informative to analyze AnxA2-mediated activities. In fact, we observed that lentiviral shRNA administration caused a transient decrease of AnxA2 in cells and affected the trapping of tau in neuronal processes. In contrast, long-term expression of shRNA did not result in a decrease of AnxA2 protein, probably because of compensating mechanisms (unpublished data).Our observation that the R406W mutation reduces trapping of tau in the distal neurite, which is probably caused by its decreased interaction with AnxA2, could be relevant in a neurodegenerative scenario. Decreased binding of R406W tau could result in a reduced stability of the presynapse and a distribution of tau R406W, which is less confined to the distal process. In this context, it appears remarkable that both Aβ-mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau in an AD scenario and the R406W mutation converge with respect to a loss of function of tau to interact with the plasma membrane. This could provide an explanation as to why the R406W tau mutation produces a phenotype that is clinically closely related to AD. Interestingly, in pathological conditions including seizures and AD, AnxA2 expression is increased (<Eberhard et al., 1994>). This could point to a compensatory mechanism of affected neurons in an attempt to rescue tau’s membrane interaction in such patients. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, cell culture media and supplements were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen, and culture flasks, plates, and dishes from were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, unless stated otherwise. The following antibodies were used. Phosphorylation-independent human tau antibodies: Tau-5 (mouse; BD) and anti-tau (rabbit; Synaptic Systems GmbH). Phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies: AT270 (Thr-181, mouse; Pierce), pT205 (Thr-205, rabbit; Invitrogen), pT212 (Thr-212, rabbit; Invitrogen), p214 (Ser-214, rabbit; Invitrogen), pS262 (Ser-262, rabbit; Invitrogen), PHF1 (mouse; a generous gift of P. Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), and Tau-1 (mouse; a generous gift of L. Binder, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Also used were anti-GFP (rabbit; Invitrogen), anti-FLAG (M5), anti-tubulin (mouse, DM1A; rat, YL1/2), anti-acetylated tubulin (mouse; 6-11B-1), anti-actin (mouse, JLA20; EMD) and anti-AnxA2 (mouse, annexin II [H-5], Santa Cruz Biotechnology; mouse, HH7 [<Thiel et al., 1992>]). As secondary antibodies, peroxidase-, Cy3-, and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti–mouse and anti–rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used. Eukaryotic expression plasmids for fetal (352 aa) or adult (441 aa) human tau with amino-terminally fused FLAG, mRFP, EGFP, and PAGFP tags were constructed in pRc/cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based expression vectors (Invitrogen) containing a CMV promoter and kanamycin and neomycin resistance genes. PAGFP was constructed from EGFP by changing the codons L64F, T65S, V163A, and T203H by site-directed mutagenesis with primers as described previously (<Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002>). The vector pSETbmRFP was provided by R.Y. Tsien (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). To produce R406W tau constructs, R406 was mutated to W by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective codon. Annexin A2 amino-terminally fused to PAGFP was cloned into the lentiviral vector L26FSy(1.1)GW (provided by P. Osten, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL), which contains the neuron-specific promoter Synapsin I (<Dittgen et al., 2004>). Sequences that were introduced by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing.Transfections of PC12 cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) essentially as described previously (<Fath et al., 2002>). For generation of stable lines, individual clones were selected in the presence of 500 µg/ml Geneticin, then picked and propagated in serum-DME supplemented with 250 µg/ml Geneticin on collagen-coated culture dishes as described previously (<Brandt et al., 1995>). For each construct, several independent clonal lines were selected that expressed comparable levels of the protein.For production of lentivirus, human embryonic kidney cells 293FT (Invitrogen) were transfected with the expression vector and two helper plasmids using TransIT-293 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC). Viral particles from the supernatant were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and used to infect PC12 cells. PC12 cells were cultured in serum-DME as described previously (<Fath et al., 2002>). For stable lines, 250 µg/ml Geneticin was included in the medium. Undifferentiated cells were plated on 35-mm polylysine- and collagen-coated glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corporation) at 103 cells/cm2 and cultured in DME with 1% (vol/vol) serum. Cells were flattened by addition of 100 ng/ml 7S mouse NGF (Alomone Laboratories) for 1–2 d. For neuronal differentiation, NGF treatment was extended to 4–6 d and the medium was changed every 2–3 d. Before imaging, the medium was exchanged against the same medium containing DME without Phenol red. For some experiments, cells were treated with 10 nM BAPTA/AM (EMD) for 30 min before imaging.Primary cortical cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of mouse embryos (day 15–17 of gestation) and cultured as described previously (<Leschik et al., 2007>). The cultures were obtained by breeding C57BL/6 mice. Cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 on polylysine- and laminin-coated coverslips. Immunocytochemistry after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and a combined NP-40 detergent extraction–fixation procedure to reveal cytoskeletal association were performed as described previously (<Brandt et al., 1995>). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a dry 20× (NA 0.45; ELWD), an oil-immersion 60× (NA 1.4), and an oil-immersion 100× (NA 1.3) objective lens on a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U; Nikon) equipped with a digital camera (COOL-1300; Vosskühler). Image analysis used the program Lucia G version 4.60 (Nikon). Live imaging was performed on a laser scanning microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U inverted; Nikon) equipped with argon (488 nm), helium/neon (543 nm) and blue diode (405 nm) lasers. PAGFP-expressing cells were visualized with a Fluor 60× (NA 1."
PMC3044115_10,"4) UV-corrected (VC) objective lens  The microscope was enclosed in an incubation chamber maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 (Solent Scientific Limited). Automated image acquisition after photoactivation was essentially performed as described previously (<Weissmann et al., 2009>). Photoactivation was performed with the blue diode producing an activation spot 5 µm in diameter. Frames were obtained at a frequency of 1 frame/s or 1 frame/12 s, and 112 frames were collected per experiment. Standard series were collected at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. For higher resolution imaging, images were collected at 512 × 512 pixels with a frame frequency of one frame every 3 s. Live cell imaging of EGFP-expressing cell lines was performed by acquiring images of single cells at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels at 488 nm. Cells were relocated at different days with the help of gridded incubation chambers. Determination of process numbers and length was performed using EZ-C1 software (Nikon). Image analysis of photoactivation experiments was performed essentially as described previously (<Weissmann et al., 2009>). To provide a visual representation of the distribution over time, data were plotted as a color-coded filled contour plot of 2D intensity function. To compare the distribution of different constructs, It/Itot from the fluorescence intensity at time t after activation in the activated segment and the fluorescence signal from total photoactivation were determined. This value reflects the immobile fraction of the activated population in the activated segment at time t. Effective diffusion coefficients were determined by using a diffusion model solving Fick’s second diffusion equation and fitting the data from the photoactivation experiments as described previously (<Weissmann et al., 2009>). PC12 cells stably expressing PAGFP-wt tau or R406W tau were plated on 35-mm dishes. After 24 h, medium was exchanged to serum-DME containing 5 µg/ml hexadimethrine bromide to neutralize charge interactions and to increase binding between the pseudoviral capsid and the cellular membrane. Lentiviral particles coding for AnxA2 shRNA or a scrambled shRNA sequence as a control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were thawed at room temperature, gently mixed before use, and added to the culture. After overnight exposure at 37°C and 5% CO2, medium was exchanged against serum-DME. Tau-expressing stable lines were additionally treated with 250 µg/ml Geneticin. To select stable clones expressing the AnxA2 shRNA or the control shRNA, cells were split on the next day 1:4 and incubated for another 24 h in serum-DME. Selection was performed with 5 µg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Acros Organics). Medium was replaced with fresh Geneticin- and puromycin-containing medium every 3–4 d. 6 d after infection, NGF treatment with 100 ng/ml 7S mouse NGF was started and continued for 4 d. Cells were analyzed 10 d after infection. For immunoblotting, cell lysate was prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM EGTA). Microsphere separation of the neural membrane cortex was performed from PC12 cells stably expressing wt tau or R406W tau as described previously (<Maas et al., 2000>). PC12 cells stably transfected with FLAG-wt tau or FLAG-R406W tau were surface labeled with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce) and incubated with streptavidin-coated microspheres. Cellular homogenates were prepared by freeze-thawing the scraped-off cells in a separation buffer (0.25 M sucrose containing 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors), and the plasma membrane/membrane cortex fraction (PM) was separated with a magnetic bead attractor. The unbound material was separated by ultracentrifugation into an organelle/membrane pellet and a cytosol fraction (<Fig. 4 A>). A tau expression vector was generated by site-specific recombination (Gateway; Invitrogen) of the PCR-amplified 441 tau open reading frame into the MoMLV-based vector pZome1 (Cellzome; Euroscarf GmbH). Pools of SKNBE2 cells stably expressing TAP-tagged full-length tau were generated by viral transduction as described previously (<Brajenovic et al., 2004>). TAP and MS procedures were performed as described previously (<Brajenovic et al., 2004>). In brief, cell lysates were incubated with IgG agarose, and the beads were collected, washed, and incubated with tobacco etch virus protease. The eluate was transferred into a column containing calmodulin agarose and the column was eluted with 600 µl elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM EGTA, pH 8.0). Samples were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gels and stained with colloidal Coomassie. Gels were cut across the entire separation range of each lane to sample all proteins without bias with respect to size and relative abundance. Cut bands were reduced, alkylated, and digested, and peptides were sequenced by tandem MS (LC-MS/MS, QTOF Ultima, and CapLC; Waters). Most proteins were unambiguously identified by the sequencing of several independent peptides. Recombinant 352 and 441 tau variants were expressed with an amino-terminal FLAG-tag in the yeast strain DHD5 (<Kirchrath et al., 2000>) from episomal vectors based on YEp352 (2 µm, URA3 → pJJH447) under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter. The coding sequence for an AnxA2–GFP fusion protein was expressed under the control of the constitutive PFK2 promoter from a vector based on YEplac181 (2 µm, LEU2 → pJJH216). Transformants were grown on synthetic minimal media selecting for plasmid maintenance and using 2% galactose as a carbon source for high-level expression of the tau constructs. Yeast extracts were prepared from yeast cells expressing recombinant GFP–AnxA2 and wt tau or R406W tau (352 and 441) in Ca2+-containing lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.15% NP-40, and 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5) by vigorous shaking with glass beads for 7 min at 4°C. In all cases, the buffer also contained protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate). GFP-Trap_A beads (ChromoTek) were equilibrated in 500 µl ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM CaCl2. Lysates were diluted to 500 µl with IP buffer, and 10% were saved (“input” fraction). The remaining lysate was incubated with the equilibrated GFP-Trap_A beads by end-over-end mixing for 2 h at 4°C. GFP or GFP fusion proteins were pulled-down by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 2 min at 4°C. For immunoblot analysis, 50 µl of the supernatant were saved (“supernat.” fraction in <Fig. 7 B>). The pellet was washed twice with ice-cold IP buffer, resuspended in 100 µl 2× SDS-sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min at 95°C to dissociate the immunocomplexes from the beads. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 2,700 g for 2 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was saved (“GFP pull down” fraction in <Fig. 7 B>). For SDS-PAGE, 2% of the lysate (“input” in <Fig. 7 B>) and 10% each of the “supernat.” and “GFP pull down” fraction were loaded. Immunoblot analysis and quantification of the blots were performed as described previously (<Leschik et al., 2007>). Data were expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis among experimental groups was performed using a paired Student’s t test (Origin 7.0) or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc Bonferroni test. P-values are *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; and ***, P < 0.001. The R406W mutation prevents tau from functioning as a linker between the membrane and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Changes of the microtubule-associated protein tau are central in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). However, the functional consequence of the FTDP-17 tau mutation R406W, which causes a tauopathy clinically resembling AD, is not well understood."
PMC3044115_11,"We find that the R406W mutation does not affect microtubule interaction but abolishes tau’s membrane binding  Loss of binding is associated with decreased trapping at the tip of neurites and increased length fluctuations during process growth. Tandem affinity purification tag purification and mass spectrometry identify the calcium-regulated plasma membrane–binding protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) as a potential interaction partner of tau. Consistently, wild-type tau but not R406W tau interacts with AnxA2 in a heterologous yeast expression system. Sequestration of Ca2+ or knockdown of AnxA2 abolishes the differential trapping of wild-type and R406W tau. We suggest that the pathological effect of the R406W mutation is caused by impaired membrane binding, which involves a functional interaction with AnxA2 as a membrane–cytoskeleton linker. ."
PMC3237612_0,"Proteolytic cleavage of tau at glutamic acid 391 (E391) is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). This C-terminal truncated tau species exists in neurofibrillary tangles and abnormal neurites in the brains of AD patients and may potentiate tau polymerization. We generated a mouse model that expresses human tau truncated at E391 to begin to elucidate the role of this C-terminal truncated tau species in the development of tau pathology. Our results show that truncated but otherwise wild type human tau is sufficient to drive pre-tangle pathological changes in tau, including accumulation of insoluble tau, somatodendritic redistribution, formation of pathological conformations, and dual phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with AD pathology. In addition, these mice exhibit atypical neuritic tau immunoreactivity, including abnormal neuritic processes and dystrophic neurites. These results suggest that changes in tau proteolysis can initiate tauopathy.

Tau is a normal, highly abundant protein in brain that is also part of the neuropathology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions. Diseases with pathological deposits of tau protein are collectively referred to as tauopathies; tau aggregates in these disorders form abnormal fibrillar tangles in neurons, and in some cases in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (<1>–<4>). Tau is a microtubule-binding protein that promotes microtubule assembly and stabilizes formed microtubules. In tauopathies, fibrillar tau is found in low level aggregates, or as mature tangles, both of which may contribute to cellular dysfunction (<5>). Human tau is encoded by a single gene (MAPT) that is alternatively spliced to generate 6 tau isoforms that are distinguishable by the exclusion or inclusion of a repeat region of exon 10, referred to as 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) tau, respectively (<6>).Proteolytic cleavage of tau at the C-terminus is linked to the pathogenesis of AD (<7>). Truncated tau terminating at glutamic acid 391 (E391) is a component of the paired helical filaments core, present in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and abnormal neurites in AD patient brains (<8>, <9>) and is positively correlated with the severity of dementia (<10>). In addition, the appearance of E391-truncated tau precedes that of tangle formation (<8>, <11>). This C-terminal truncation greatly increases the rate of tau polymerization in vitro compared to that of full-length tau; thus, tau truncation may play a role in seeding tangle formation (<11>, <12>).We generated a human 4R-tau truncation construct of E391 and introduced this transgene into mice to elucidate the role of this C-terminal truncated tau species in the development of tau pathology. We found that a moderate level expression of truncated but otherwise wild type human tau is sufficient to drive pathological changes in tau. The 3R- and 4R-specific tau antibodies were developed by de Silva et al (<13>). The 3R-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (RD3, Upstate Cell Signaling, Lake Placid, NY) is raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 209–224 of human tau (numbering based on the 0N3R isoform). The 4R-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (RD4, Upstate Cell Signaling) is raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 275–291 of human tau (numbering based on 2N4R tau). T14 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes human tau residues 83–120 (based on 2N4R tau numbering) (<14>) but not mouse tau. T49 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that is specific for rodent tau and does not recognize human tau (<15>). Rabbit polyclonal 17025 is a pan-tau antibody recognizing total mouse and human tau raised against full-length recombinant tau. T14, T49 and 17025 were provided by Dr. Virginia Lee (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). AT8 (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) is a phosphorylation-dependent mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes paired helical filament-tau phosphorylated on dual sites Ser202 and Thr205. Two other monoclonal anti-phospho-tau antibodies related to tau pathology were also used: AT180 (phospho-Thr 231; Pierce Biotechnology) and CP13 (phospho-Ser 202; provided by Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Alz50 is a phosphorylation-independent mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 5–15 and 312–322 of tau and is specific for a pathological tau conformation (<16>). MC-1 is also a conformation-specific mouse monoclonal antibody similar to Alz-50 that recognizes amino acids 7–9 and 313–322 of tau (<17>, <18>). Alz-50 and MC-1 were both provided by Peter Davies. A third conformation-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, Tau2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), recognizes a phosphorylation-independent epitope (corresponding to amino acid 95–108 of bovine tau) that is pathologically modified as tau protein is phosphorylated to form NFTs (<19>). The anti-Actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) recognizes a C-terminal Actin epitope from many species. The cDNA encoding the most abundant brain isoform (4R1N) truncated at position 391 (<11>) was cloned into the unique XHO I site in a mouse neuron-specific expression vector containing pThy1.2 (<20>). Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear microinjection of the THY1.2::TauΔ391 transgene at the University of Washington Transgenic Resources Program as a fee-for-service project. Founders were identified by PCR analysis of tail biopsies, as described below. Founder mice were intercrossed with C57BL/6 mice to establish lines. Hemizygous mice were used as study subjects. Mice were genotyped using DNA prepared from tail clips for live mice. The presence of the THY1.2::TauE391 transgene was detected by PCR analysis using the following primers: cDNA trunc-F AAGATCGGCTCCACTGAGAA cDNA trunc-R GGACGTGGGTGATATTGTCC Mice were genotyped using DNA prepared from tail clips for live mice. The presence of the THY1.2::TauE391 transgene was detected by PCR analysis using the following primers:yielding a 316-bp product for the hemizygous E391 transgenic mice and no product for wild type control animals. We conducted a sequential extraction of tau protein using buffers of increasing solubilizing strength as previously described (<21>). Mouse brains from 3 non-transgenic (NTG), 6 3608, and 7 3610 transgenic mice were isolated and snap-frozen in liquid N2 prior to extraction. Mouse brain hemispheres were homogenized in high salt re-assembly buffer (RAB-High Salt [0.1 M MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.75 M NaCl, 0.02 M NaF, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.0]) and ultra-centrifuged at 50,000 × gravity yielding the soluble fraction (supernatant) and an insoluble pellet. Next, myelin was floated by resuspending the pellet in RAB/1M sucrose and centrifuging as above. To extract detergent soluble tau, the RAB-insoluble material was re-extracted with an ionic and non-ionic detergent containing RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) and centrifuged as above yielding abnormal tau in the supernatant. Finally, the detergent-insoluble pellet was re-extracted with 70% formic acid (FA) to solubilize detergent-insoluble tau. Total protein fractions containing ~15 mg of protein per lane were boiled for 5 minutes and loaded onto 10% pre-cast SDS-PAGE gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Subsequent RIPA and FA-extracted fractions were normalized according to the levels of total protein in the total fraction."
PMC3237612_1,"For semiquantitative immunoblotting, we detected mouse and human tau using the pan tau antibody 17025 at a dilution of 1:3000, as described previously (<22>)  Densitometry measurements were performed using Adobe Photoshop to determine total tau levels in non-transgenic and transgenic mice. We also used human specific tau antibody T14 at 1:1000, mouse specific tau antibody T49 at 1:2000, and anti-actin antibody at 1:1000. For all genotypes, 1-year-old and 2-year-old mice (n = 3 each) were examined by immunohistochemistry; the images presented are representative of each genotype. No discernible differences were detected between 1-year-old and 2-year-old mice with any antibody. Mice were anesthetized and fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, paraffin-embedded, and coronal sections from the hippocampus were cut at 10-μm thickness and stored at 4°C until use. Sections were immunostained with RD4 (1:80), RD3 (1:800), T14 (1:500), AT8 (1:250), Alz50 (1:25), MC-1 (1:75), and Tau2 (1:500). Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through alcohols and an antigen retrieval step consisting of heat pretreatment by microwave (AT8, Alz50, MC-1, Tau2 and RD3) or autoclave (RD4) in DakoCytomation Target Retrieval Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used. Antibody T14 did not require antigen retrieval. Sections were treated for endogenous peroxidases with 3% H2O2 in PBS (pH 7.4), blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by biotinylated secondary antibody for 45 minutes at room temperature. Finally, sections were incubated in an avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) and the reaction product was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine/0.01% H2O2 in PBS. Negative controls with secondary antibody alone did not immunostain tissue sections (data not shown). Photomicrographs were taken with a digital camera and imported into Adobe Photoshop for mounting. To optimize visualization of staining, photomicrographs were modified (when necessary) by adjusting brightness and contrast. To test the hypothesis that truncated tau promotes tau aggregation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing tau truncated at position E391 (E391 mice) using the Thy1.2 neuron specific promoter (<Fig. 1A>). This construct expresses the 4R1N tau isoform, which is the most abundant isoform in human brain. The construct contains sequences encoded by alternatively spliced exons 2 and 10 and has 4 microtubule binding repeats. Two founder mouse lines (E391-3610 and E391-3608) expressing E391 truncated tau were generated. To measure total tau levels, whole 1-year-old mouse brains were homogenized and immunoblotted with a pan-tau-specific antibody, demonstrating total tau levels ~1.9-fold greater than normal endogenous mouse tau in E391-3608 mice and ~2.6-fold greater in E391-3610 mice (<Fig. 1B>). We homogenized brain hemispheres from NTG mice and the 2 transgenic founder lines in RAB, a high salt buffer, yielding the soluble tau fraction. There were roughly similar levels of total tau among animals in this fraction. Although the large amount of total tau made it difficult to distinguish soluble human tau from endogenous mouse tau, these similar levels indicated that expression of the human transgene was relatively low compared to that of endogenous mouse tau. We re-extracted material insoluble in RAB with RIPA, an ionic and non-ionic detergent containing buffer, yielding the detergent soluble fraction. Subsequently, we recovered detergent-insoluble material by extraction with FA. NTG animals exhibited nearly all tau in the soluble fraction (RAB), with no detergent-insoluble truncated tau detected. In contrast, E391-3608 and E391-3610 mice exhibited marked accumulation of truncated tau species in the detergent soluble (RIPA) and insoluble (FA) fractions, with higher expression exhibited by mouse line E391-3610 (<Fig. 1C>). FA fractions contained abundant truncated human E391 tau as detected by T14 human tau-specific antibody, but virtually no endogenous mouse tau was detected by T49, the mouse tau-specific antibody (<Fig. 1D>). In newborn mouse brain, 3R-tau is the predominant isoform, whereas in adult mice the predominant isoform changes to 4R-tau (<23>–<25>). We examined isoform-specific expression of tau in the brains of aged (1 and 2 year old) NTG mice and transgenic mice expressing E391-truncated human 4R-tau by immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for 3R and 4R tau. As expected, 3R-tau was undetectable in all mouse lines used with the exception of occasional neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, as previously reported (26, 27 and data not shown). We next used a panel of tau-specific antibodies to compare tau distribution and pathology in NTG and E391 transgenic mice. All tau immunoreactivity was specific for 4R-tau since 3R-tau was not expressed in the mouse lines studied. Using an antibody specific for 4R-tau (RD4), we demonstrated that aged NTG mice exhibit a normal axonal distribution of tau, with high levels of expression in CA3 mossy fibers, hilus, inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and somewhat lower levels in the stratum radiatum and oriens (<Fig. 2A>). All hippocampal CA pyramidal neurons were negative. In the cortex, tau staining was primarily localized to the neuropil (<Figs. 2A>, <3A>). Neuronal cell bodies were never positively stained with antibodies to 4R-tau in the cortex or hippocampus of NTG mice. This axonal distribution in NTG mice was similar to previous reports (<28>, <29>). In addition, we detected tau immunostaining in small, non-neuronal cells throughout the brain, in both white and gray matter; these were likely glial cells (<Figs. 2A>, <3A>).In the line expressing higher levels of E391-truncated 4R-tau (E391-3610), we observed a similar axonal distribution of tau. In addition, tau immunostaining was prevalent in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons and CA1 apical dendrites, as well as granule cells of the dentate gyrus (<Fig. 2C, H, J>). CA2 pyramidal neurons were not immunoreactive for tau. This somatodendritic relocalization of tau upon overexpression was previously described (<30>, <31>). In the cortex, the synaptic-like pattern of tau immunostaining in the neuropil was again evident (<Figs. 2C>, <3C>). Although the majority of neuronal cell bodies were negative for RD4, accumulation of tau was detectable in some neuronal cell bodies and extended into dendrites, especially in the more lateral cortical regions (<Fig. 2C>, inset). In addition, there was a granular dot-like pattern of staining in the cingulate gyrus (CG) and supracallosal region that resembled abnormal neuritic processes (<Fig. 3C>, asterisks and inset). This staining was more prevalent in deeper layers of the CG.In the mouse line expressing lower levels of E391-truncated 4R-tau (E391-3608), the normal hilar/mossy fiber axonal staining seen in NTG and E391-3610 mice was prominent using the 4R-tau specific antibody; however, the inner dentate molecular layer was negative (<Fig. 2B>). As detected in E391-3610 mice, a somatodendritic re-distribution was apparent but the pattern of this distribution was strikingly different, especially in the hippocampus. Dentate granule neurons were mostly negative, except for the outer most superficial granule cells (SGCs), located at the border of the granule cell layer facing the molecular layer (<Fig. 2B, G>). These SGCs stained intensely for tau in both the cell bodies and dendrites projecting to the dentate molecular layer and were especially evident in the dorsal blade compared to the ventral blade of the dentate gyrus. CA pyramidal neurons were mostly negative, except for scattered neurons in the CA1, primarily in the medial region, in which several soma and dendritic processes projecting through the stratum radiatum stained intensely for tau (<Fig. 2B, I>). We also observed robust tau immunoreactivity in neuropil and neuronal cell bodies in the amygdala, a result not seen in E391-3610 mice or NTG mice (<Fig. 4A, B>)."
PMC3237612_2,"Cortical tau immunoreactivity was similar to that observed in E391-3610 mice, except that more neuronal cell bodies and dendrites were positively stained (<Figs  2B>, <3B>). In addition, neuronal cell bodies and processes were positively stained in the entorhinal cortex (EC), a result that was not apparent in E391-3610 or NTG mice (<Fig. 4E, F>). We also observed the abnormal granular dot-like staining in the CG and supracallosal region (<Figs. 3B>, <5B–D>, asterisks). These presumptive neuritic processes were also apparent in the EC as well as medial temporal regions such as the amygdala. Pyramidal neurons in the cortex often appeared irregular, with thickened, atypical apical dendrites (<Fig. 5A, F>; arrowheads). In addition, the 4R-tau specific antibody revealed occasional atypical dystrophic neurites that were non-symmetrical and often abnormally oriented to the cortical surface (<Fig. 5B, D–F;> arrows), similar to tau-positive dystrophic neurites observed in AD. These dystrophic neurites were most prevalent in the CG but also appeared in the EC.In the transgenic E391-3608 mouse line, we observed mild staining of glial cells, similar to that observed in NTG mice. Tau immunoreactivity in glial cells in NTG and transgenic animals appeared to be specific for mouse tau rather than human tau because the mouse tau-specific antibody T49 displayed robust staining in glial cells in all mice (NTG, 3608 and 3610), whereas the human-specific tau antibody T14 failed to detect this glial immunoreactivity (data not shown). Additionally, glial immunoreactivity of mouse-specific tau appeared to be age-dependent, i.e. young adult animals (postnatal day 24) did not show immunoreactivity for T49 in glial cells, whereas aged animals (1 and 2 years) displayed robust T49 immunoreactivity in glial cells (data not shown). Tau immunoreactivity in glial cells under normal conditions was somewhat surprising because this has not been previously documented. However, we did not pursue this finding because it was specific for mouse tau also in NTG mice and not specific to the tau transgene under study. Our 2 transgenic mouse lines express human E391 truncated 4R-tau on a mouse tau background. Thus the tau immunostaining described above using the 4R-tau specific antibody (RD4) could be due to expression of human and/or mouse tau. To determine the contribution of the human E391 truncated 4R-tau, we immunostained with T14, a tau antibody that is specific for human tau. As expected, T14 did not detect tau in NTG mice (<Figs. 2D>, <3D>). In transgenic mice, the pattern of immunostaining observed using the human-specific antibody was similar to that obtained with the RD4 antibody, although less robust (<Figs. 2E, F, K–N>, <3E, F>). Normal axonal distribution was apparent in the mossy fibers and hilus, although the synaptic-like pattern of tau immunostaining in the cortex, stratum radiatum and stratum oriens (staining of neuropil) was less evident with the human specific antibody, particularly in the lower expressing mouse line (E391-3608). In contrast, the somatodendritic redistribution of tau was more prevalent (more cell body and dendritic staining) using the human-specific antibody, particularly in the higher expressing mouse line (E391-3610). Interestingly, the human tau-specific antibody positively stained neurons in the amygdala and EC in both mouse lines, whereas only the lower expressing mouse line (E391-3608) demonstrated tau immunoreactivity in these regions using the 4R-tau specific antibody (<Fig. 4>). The human tau-specific antibody also detected the granular dot-like staining of presumptive neuritic processes in the CG in both mouse lines, although at low levels. Only the lower expressing mouse line displayed this abnormal granular staining in the EC and amygdala. In addition, the human specific tau antibody detected the irregularly shaped dystrophic neurites in the lower expressing mouse line, similar to what was observed using the 4R-tau specific antibody. Thus, the truncated human tau expressed in these mice exhibited some normal axonal distribution as well as somatodendritic redistribution and later stages of tau pathology, including atypical neurites. The antibodies Alz50, MC1, and Tau2 recognize a pathological conformation of tau that is accompanied by the assembly of tau aggregates similar to those seen in AD. The conformation of tau recognized by these antibodies is an earlier stage of tau pathology, i.e. preceding tangle formation. As expected, NTG mice were not immunoreactive for Alz50, MC1 and Tau2 immunostaining (<Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A279). Mice expressing higher levels of human E391-truncated 4R-tau (E391-3610) positively stained with these antibodies; the distribution was similar to that observed with the 4R-tau-specific antibody RD4, and the human tau-specific antibody T14, with a few exceptions. Immunostaining with Alz50 demonstrated the normal axonal distribution of tau in the hippocampus, but not the somatodendritic redistribution observed with the RD4 or T14 antibodies (<Fig. 6B, D>, <Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A279). Furthermore, neither cortical neuropil nor neurons (including in CG and EC) were immunoreactive for Alz50; however, abnormal neuritic processes were immunoreactive (<Fig. 7B>, asterisks). In contrast, immunostaining using the MC1 and Tau2 antibodies did demonstrate a somatodendritic distribution in cortical and hippocampal neurons (<Figs. 6>, <7>, <Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A279). None of these conformation-specific tau antibodies positively stained neuronal soma in the amygdala (<Fig. 7H, J, L>) or EC (data not shown), whereas all 3 stained abnormal neuritic processes in the CG (<Fig. 7B, D, F>, asterisks) and EC.Mice expressing lower levels of E391-truncated 4R-tau (E391-3608) also stained positively with the conformation-specific tau antibodies. Immunostaining with Alz50 and Tau2 were identical to that observed using the RD4 and T14 antibodies, with both neuropil and somatodendritic distribution in the hippocampus, CG, EC, and amygdala (<Figs. 6>, <7>, <Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A279), as well as atypical neurites. Neuronal accumulation of tau appeared as dense staining surrounding the nucleus and extended into dendrites, and in some cases, Tau2 immunoreactivity completely filled the soma (<Fig. 5F>). The MC1 antibody demonstrated redistribution to neuronal cell bodies, but the dendritic staining was absent. Immunoreactive cell bodies were limited to the cortex (including the CG and EC), amygdala and SGCs of the dentate gyrus (<Figs. 6>, <7>, <Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A279). The neuronal cell bodies and apical dendrites that stained positively with other tau antibodies in the medial region of CA1 pyramidal cells were negative for MC1 (<Fig. 6G>). Furthermore, while neuronal cell bodies were positive in the cortex, staining of neuropil was not apparent with the MC1 antibody, although axonal distribution was robust in hippocampal mossy fibers and hilus. As with Alz50 and Tau2, atypical neurites (granular dot-like neuritic processes and dystrophic neurites) in the EC and amygdala were detected by MC1, although much less apparent in the CG. Antibody AT8 detects dual phosphorylation sites (phospho-Ser 202 and phospho-Thr 205) characteristic of tau in AD. This pair-wise phosphorylation of tau indicates advanced stage aggregation. As expected, NTG mice were negative for AT8 immunostaining (<Fig. 8A–C>). Mice expressing higher levels of E391-truncated 4R-tau (E391-3610) showed strong AT8 immunopositivity. We again observed the somatodendritic redistribution detected using the other tau antibodies (RD4, T14, conformation-specific antibodies), and the neuronal accumulation of tau was abundant throughout the cortex and hippocampus (<Figs. 8>, <9>). Interestingly, AT8 stained neurons in the EC and amygdala of these mice (<Fig. 9D, F>), similar to what was observed using the human tau-specific antibody T14 (<Fig. 4>)."
PMC3237612_3,"The normal axonal distribution (mossy fibers, hilus, inner dentate molecular layer, neuropil staining of cortex) detected with the other tau antibodies was less apparent with AT8, with the exception of neuropil staining in the EC, amygdala and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus  Finally, AT8-immunoreactive granular dot-like neuritic processes were detected in the EC, but not the CG.Immunostaining for AT8 was also apparent in the E391-3608 line. The somatodendritic redistribution was evident but was not as robust as in E391-3610 mice (<Figs. 8>, <9>). The pattern of this neuronal distribution was similar to that detected with other tau antibodies, including SGCs, pyramidal neurons and apical dendrites in the medial region of CA1, cortical neurons, (including CG and EC) and in the amygdala. As in E391-3610 mice, little axonal distribution was detected using this phospho-specific antibody. Finally, atypical neurites (granular dot-like neuritic processes and dystrophic neurites) were AT8-immunoreactive in the EC and amygdala. The 2 other phospho-tau antibodies related to tau pathology, AT180 (phospho-Thr 231) and CP13 (phospho-Ser 202) were immunoreactive in both transgenic mouse lines and exhibited a somatodendritic distribution (<Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A280), further indicating that tau is hyperphosphorylated in E391 mice.In summary, truncated E391 tau exhibits a pathological phenotype (conformational change or hyperphosphorylation) in both transgenic mouse lines, although the distribution and the pathological state differ between the lines (<Table>). In general, pathological tau in the line expressing lower levels of E391-truncated 4R-tau (E391-3608) was conformationally altered and hyperphosphorylated mainly in the SGCs, CG neuronal soma and neuropil, amygdala and EC. Although pathological tau in CA1 neuronal soma and apical dendrites was rare and sporadic, the neurons that were positive were fairly robustly stained. In contrast, pathological tau in the E391-3610 line was conformationally altered and hyperphosphorylated in the inner dentate molecular layer, CA1 neuronal soma and apical dendrites, and CG neuropil. In dentate granular cells, CG neuronal soma, amygdala and EC, pathological tau was mainly hyperphosphorylated and generally did not adopt the conformationally altered phenotype. Detection of tau in the insoluble fraction, somatodendritic redistribution, tau hyperphosphorylation and conformational changes in tau all indicate “pre-tangle” tau pathology. To determine if these mice develop late-stage tau pathology in the form of frank tangle formation, Gallyas silver stain was used to identify fibrillar tau within neurons. We were unable to detect tau by Gallyas silver stain in either transgenic mouse line expressing human E391-truncated 4R-tau (<Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3>, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A281). In contrast, we were able to detect numerous Gallyas-positive silver deposits in human AD cases and in transgenic mice harboring the P301S tau mutation (PS19), as previously reported (<32>). Likewise, we readily detected thioflavin S-positive deposits in AD brain, but not in the transgenic mice (data not shown). These results indicate that tau does not undergo NFT formation in our E391 truncated tau transgenic mouse model. Truncated tau terminating at glutamic acid 391 (E391) greatly potentiates tau polymerization in vitro and is known to exist in NFTs and abnormal neurites in the brains of AD patients (<8>, <9>). To elucidate the role of this C-terminal truncated tau species in the development of tau pathology we generated a mouse model that expresses human 4R-tau truncated at E391. Many pathological changes in the tau protein occur in AD and other tauopathies, including somatodendritic redistribution, aggregation, adoption of a pathological conformation, hyperphosphorylation, and tangle formation (<16>, <33>–<35>). In this study, we examined the brains of aged E391-truncated 4R-tau transgenic mice for these pathological changes in tau.We generated 2 mouse lines that express human 4R-tau truncated at E391 at different levels, with higher and lower expression, i.e. E391-3610 and E391-3608, respectively. Both mouse lines exhibit relatively low levels of transgene expression compared to other mouse models of tauopathy. Previous transgenic models overexpressing full-length or truncated wild type human tau have required high levels of tau overexpression (ranging from 4- to 15-fold) to achieve pathological changes in tau and neurotoxicity (<20>, <21>, <36>–<38>). In our study, despite relatively low levels of transgene expression, we observed E391 truncated tau driving pre-tangle pathological changes in tau, including accumulation of tau in the insoluble fraction, somatodendritic redistribution, formation of pathological conformations, and dual phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with AD pathology. These findings are consistent with tau truncation promoting tau aggregation, as has been suggested in previous in vitro studies (<11>, <39>).Both transgenic mouse lines also exhibited atypical neurites characterized by granular dot-like staining in the CG and EC, which could be detected with a variety of tau antibodies. In E391-3608 mice these presumptive abnormal neuritic processes were also apparent in medial temporal regions such as the amygdala. In addition to this abnormal granular dot-like staining pattern, E391-3608 mice also displayed atypical neurites resembling dystrophic neurites in the CG, EC and amygdala. These dystrophic neurites were irregularly shaped with abnormal orientation to the cortical surface, similar to tau positive dystrophic neurites observed in AD. In addition, pyramidal neurons in the cortex often appeared irregular, with thickened, atypical apical dendrites. These results indicate that expression of human E391-truncated 4R-tau is sufficient to generate much of the tau pathology characteristic of AD and other tauopathies. However, despite these many pathological changes in tau, neither mouse line developed frank tangles, suggesting that whereas low level expression of E391-truncated 4R-tau is sufficient to generate pre-tangle stage tau pathology, additional factors such as full-length tau or longer lifespan are required for frank tangle formation.Several studies describe transgenic rat models expressing truncated human tau (<37>, <38>). Overexpression (4–5 fold) of a double truncated (N and C-terminal) 3R or 4R human tau species resulted in NFTs in the brainstem and cortex, respectively. Additionally, accumulation of insoluble tau composed of both human truncated tau and endogenous rat tau was observed. Rats expressing the 4R truncated tau also developed progressive muscle weakness, eventually leading to wasting and death. These studies suggest a role for truncated tau in the development of neurofibrillary pathology. Our mouse model expresses tau cleaved only at the C-terminus, perhaps explaining the lack of tangle formation. Both N and C-terminally truncated tau show an enhanced propensity for aggregation and a doubly truncated protein may be more pathogenic. Indeed, a truncated tau fragment lacking both the N and C-terminus is highly aggregation-prone and a mouse model expressing this fragment exhibits extensive tau pathology (<40>). In addition, our mouse model expresses tau at relatively low levels. It may be that extensive overexpression is required for NFT formation to develop in many mouse models of tau pathology. Still, our model expressing more biologically significant levels of C-terminally truncated tau develops pre-tangle pathological changes that could potentially develop into NFTs if the lifespan of the animal were longer.Of interest were the varying degrees of tau pathology in the 2 mouse lines, despite the expression of the same transgene. One might expect that the mouse line expressing higher levels of E391-truncated 4R-tau would exhibit more tau pathology, but that was not the case."
PMC3237612_4,"We detected granular dot-like tau immunoreactivity, suggestive of abnormal neuritic processes, in the EC, CG, and amygdala in the lower expressing E301-3608 mouse line  The EC is the earliest affected brain region in AD, while the CG and amygdala are generally affected at later stages (<41>). Thus, the presence of abnormal neuritic processes in all these regions of E391-3608 mice suggests a more advanced stage of tau pathology. In addition to granular dot-like neuritic processes, E391-3608 mice also exhibited atypical neurites in the form of tau-positive irregularly shaped and abnormally oriented dystrophic neurites in the CG, EC and amygdala. These dystrophic neurites, which are similar to tau positive dystrophic neurites observed in AD, were never discernible in E391-3610 mice. At present, the significance of greater pathology associated with lower truncated tau expression is unknown. It is possible that lower levels of truncated tau protein may be more toxic because the lower intracellular concentration of tau remains in an unaggregated state longer and may recruit other tau species into toxic conformations. Alternatively, the varying degrees of tau pathology in the 2 transgenic lines may simply be the result of differences in the integration site of the transgene, rather than differences in expression levels. Although differences in integration site can be responsible for the varying degrees of expression level and pathology, because both mouse lines developed tau pathology, the overall phenotype is due to the presence of the E391 transgene and not a non-specific effect of the integration site.Immunostaining with a panel of tau antibodies that detect both normal and pathological tau revealed differences in the distribution of tau species between the lines that might play a role in their differing tau pathologies. One of the more interesting differences was the greater tau immunoreactivity in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in the EC and amygdala in E391-3608 mice vs. E391-3610 mice. Mis-sorting of tau to the somatodendritic compartment may occur when tau levels are increased to a level that overwhelms the normal axonal sorting machinery (<31>, <42>). Despite the lower overall expression of truncated tau in E391-3608 mice, it is possible that localized expression in some regions (the EC and amygdala) may be higher than in E391-3610 mice. Moreover, tau developed a pathological conformation (as detected by Alz50, MC1 and Tau2) in the EC and amygdala in E391-3608, but not E391-3610 mice. A conformational change definedby an increased immunoreactivity against these antibodies isconsidered to be one of the earliest pathological alterationsof tau in AD (<43>–<45>). The increased somatodendritic mis-localization of tau and the development of a pathological conformation of tau in these regions could interrupt normal axonal transport. In fact, Garcia-Sierra et al demonstrated the appearance of E391 truncated tau in extracellular NFTs in the EC of AD subjects (detected with mAb423) and postulated a susceptibility of the perforant pathway, the axons providing major input from the EC to the hippocampus (<12>). In a separate study these authors report that while both E391 truncated tau and Alz-50 immunoreactive tau exist in NFTs in AD brain, they do not colocalize and appear to occur at different stages during tangle development (<46>). While this may be the case for NFTs in AD, our data suggest this is not the case in the pre-tangle stage of tau pathology in our transgenic mice, given that E391 tau appears to adopt the Alz50 conformation.Another interesting observation was the detection of tau (with both non-pathological and pathological tau antibodies) in the SGCs of the dentate gyrus in E391-3608 mice. Tau immunoreactivity in these SGCs was more evident in the dorsal blade than in the ventral blade of the dentate gyrus. SGCs typically are larger cells with more complex dendritic trees than the dentate granule cells residing in the deeper layers (<47>, <48>). They are considered to be older cells, often born prenatally or in the early postnatal period, which have migrated to reside in the superficial portion of the dentate gyrus (<49>–<51>). They do not undergo adult neurogenesis that has been described in granule cells residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In addition, the dorsal blade develops relatively early compared to the ventral blade (<52>). Thus, it is postulated that these SGCs of the dorsal blade are more mature, less plastic, and more susceptible to toxic insult (<53>). The vulnerability of this subset of neurons to AD pathology has been suggested in an AD mouse model overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (PDAPP mice), in which the authors describe substantial dendritic pathology (decreased dendritic length) that specifically occurs in these neurons well before the accumulation of amyloid pathology (<53>). Thus, expression of tau, especially conformationally altered and hyperphosphorylated tau, in these neurons is of great interest.A third major difference in tau distribution between the 2 mouse lines concerned the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Tau expression in this region in E391-3610 mice was robust and homogeneous within the soma and apical dendrites. This immunostaining was detectable with a number of tau antibodies, including RD4 and T14, as well as pathology-specific antibodies AT8, Tau2 and MC1, though MC1 staining appeared primarily in the soma. The somatodendritic redistribution to this region has been described previously and has been attributed to tau overexpression (<31>). In contrast, tau immunoreactivity in the CA1 region of E391-3608 mice was restricted to scattered cell bodies and apical dendrites, mainly in the medial CA1 pyramidal layer, and the dendrites appeared irregular and discontinuous. This staining was consistent with all of the tau antibodies used in this study (RD4, T14, AT8, Alz50, Tau2), with the exception of MC1, which did not immunostain this region. CA1 apical dendrites receive input via the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and the presence of pathological tau in this region hints at possible alterations of this pathway in our E391 truncated 4R-tau mouse lines. The discontinuous and irregular nature of the apical dendrites in the low expressing mouse line could indicate more severe alterations.In summary, we describe 2 transgenic mouse models for tauopathy in which approximately endogenous levels of transgenically expressed E391 truncated human tau are sufficient to initiate early stages of tau pathology. These pathological changes occur in the absence of FTDP-17 mutations or other insults on a background of wild type mouse tau. Previous mouse models have shown that human full-length wild type tau is relatively non-toxic as compared to mutant tau (<2>). In our E391 mice, truncated but otherwise wild type human tau is sufficient to drive pathological changes. These findings suggest that changes in tau proteolysis could give rise to early tauopathy phenotypes. rhetorical Figure 1 Human E391 truncated tau expression in transgenic mice.

This C-terminal truncated tau species exists in neurofibrillary tangles and abnormal neurites in the brains of AD patients and may potentiate tau polymerization. We generated a mouse model that expresses human tau truncated at E391 to begin to elucidate the role of this C-terminal truncated tau species in the development of tau pathology. Our results show that truncated but otherwise wild type human tau is sufficient to drive pre-tangle pathological changes in tau, including accumulation of insoluble tau, somatodendritic redistribution, formation of pathological conformations, and dual phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with AD pathology. In addition, these mice exhibit atypical neuritic tau immunoreactivity, including abnormal neuritic processes and dystrophic neurites. These results suggest that changes in tau proteolysis can initiate tauopathy. ."
PMC5176320_0,"Lysine acetylation has emerged as a dominant post-translational modification (PTM) regulating tau proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Mass spectrometry studies indicate that tau acetylation sites cluster within the microtubule-binding region (MTBR), a region that is highly conserved among tau, MAP2, and MAP4 family members, implying that acetylation could represent a conserved regulatory mechanism for MAPs beyond tau. Here, we combined mass spectrometry, biochemical assays, and cell-based approaches to demonstrate that the tau family members MAP2 and MAP4 are also subject to reversible acetylation. We identify a cluster of lysines in the MAP2 and MAP4 MTBR that undergo CBP-catalyzed acetylation, many of which are conserved in tau. Similar to tau, MAP2 acetylation can occur in a cysteine-dependent auto-regulatory manner in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Furthermore, tubulin reduced MAP2 acetylation, suggesting tubulin binding dictates MAP acetylation status. Taken together, these results uncover a striking conservation of MAP2/Tau family post-translational modifications that could expand our understanding of the dynamic mechanisms regulating microtubules. We thank Dr. Lee Graves and Dr. Laura Herring at the University of North Carolina Proteomics Core facility for providing acetylated peptide spectra/ion scores and for their very helpful and insightful discussions. The microtubule (MT)-associated protein (MAP) tau is expressed primarily in the nervous system, in which six tau isoforms exist containing either three (3R-tau) or four (4R-tau) MT-binding repeat domains. Along with the flanking regions, the MT-binding domains coordinate tau-MT binding and stabilization [<1>, <2>]. Over the last several years, we and others demonstrated that tau is subject to lysine acetylation mainly within the MT-binding repeat region (MTBR), identifying a new and emerging post-translational modification (PTM) that could dominantly regulate multiple aspects of tau function [<3>–<7>]. Indeed, our previous in vitro experiments showed that tau acetylation is sufficient to impair normal tau-MT interactions, prevent tau-mediated stabilization of MTs, and promote the formation of tau fibrils that resemble those observed in diseased brain [<3>].Neuropathological analysis of human brain tissue showed that acetylated tau at residue K280 (Lys280) within the tau MTBR accumulated in tauopathy brains and produced a distinctly pathological signature in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and also a panel of other tauopathies including corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and several FTDP-17 familial dementia patients. K280-acetylated tau was not readily detectable in control brain tissue or cultured wild-type cells or neurons, thus correlating tau acetylation at K280 with the onset or progression of tauopathy [<8>, <9>]. Recently, however, more sensitive mass spectrometry studies indicated that tau is normally acetylated in wild-type mouse brain at several lysines spanning the MTBR, suggesting a normal physiological role for tau acetylation in regulating MT-binding or MT stabilization [<7>]. Supporting this possibility, early biochemical studies showed that positively charged tau residues K280 and K281 directly contact MTs, strongly implicating this double lysine containing PHF6* motif (275VQIINK/K281) as a critical hotspot for tau-MT binding in addition to facilitating conformational β-structure and tau aggregation [<10>]. Either genetic deletion of residue K280 (ΔK280), as observed in familial FTDP-17 dementia [<11>], or lysine acetylation on residue K280, as observed in AD and related tauopathies [<3>], may be sufficient to neutralize the positive charge within this region, thereby impairing tau-MT interactions. The homologous lysine residue residing in the 3rd MTBR repeat, K311 within the PHF6 motif (306VQIVYK311), has also been shown to regulate tau biochemical properties, as a variety of substitutions at residue K311 alter tau aggregation kinetics [<12>]. Thus, MTBR lysines likely engage in critical electrostatic charge interactions; these are the same lysine residues that are also subject to acetylation, which functionally regulates tau-MT binding and stabilizing activity. Whether acetylation-dependent mechanisms similarly regulate MAPs beyond tau has not been investigated.The abundance of tau acetylation sites in normal wild-type mice supports a broader physiological role for MAP acetylation in cytoskeletal dynamics [<7>]. Tau is highly homologous to the related MAP2 and MAP4 proteins [<13>, <14>], which possess 3 or 4 MTBRs with highly conserved lysine-rich repeats. While global MAP acetylation per se has not been characterized, evidence supports an emerging network of acetylated factors localized to the cytoskeleton and also associated with MTs [<15>]. Moreover, components of the acetylation machinery are particularly enriched in close proximity to MTs including acetyltransferases such as the Elongator complex [<16>] and tubulin acetyltransferse (TAT) [<17>] as well as the deacetylases HDAC6 [<18>] and SIRT2 [<19>]. In this study, we describe lysine acetylation as a novel conserved regulatory mechanism among MAP2/Tau family members, which has implications for the regulation of MAP function and microtubule dynamics. The human tau isoform containing 2 N-terminal inserts and 4 MTBR regions (2N4R) was cloned into pCDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen).

The fractions were checked for the presence of the tau proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The fractions containing enriched tau or MAP2c were pooled together and dialyzed against 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0.

The antibodies used for western analysis were as follows: polyclonal anti-acetylated-lysine (1:1000, Cell Signaling #9441), anti-tau C-terminal clone T46 (1:1000, Thermofisher), and anti-acetylated tau, Ac-K280 [<3>] (1:1000), polyclonal anti-GFP (1:1000, Santa Cruz). Acetyltransferase assays were performed by immunoprecipitating tau or MAP2c proteins (using anti-tau/MAP2 antibody, clone T46) (Thermofisher) or MAP4 (using polyclonal anti-GFP) (Santa Cruz). MAPs were bound by protein A/G beads followed by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies (Cell Signaling) or alternatively radiolabeling was performed by addition of [14C]-Acetyl-CoA (Perkin Elmer) for 2 hr at 37°C. Radiolabeled acetylated MAPs bound to beads were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining followed by phosphorimaging using Storm software. For acetyltransferase analysis using WT and tau KO brain lysates, boiled high-salt extracted mouse cortical lysates were dialyzed into PBS and supplemented to a final concentration of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0. The desired cofactors, either CoA or acetyl-CoA, were supplemented to 1 mM and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C followed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. NanoLC nanospray MS-MS analysis was performed at the University of Pennsylvania proteomics core facility, which identified acetylated MAP2c and MAP4 lysine residues (Tables <1> and <2>).

Alignment of the MTBR domains of tau, MAP2c, and MAP4 highlights the extensive ~75% homology within their functional repeats (<Fig 2>) [<20>]. All three MAPs possess highly lysine-rich MTBRs that mediate MAP-MT electrostatic interactions, indicating the potential for conserved acetylation within their repeats. Notably, tau/MAP4 alignments showed conservation of critical tau residues K280/K281 within the 2nd repeat motif 275VQIINK/K281, and the combined tau/MAP2c/MAP4 alignment showed conservation of the 3rd repeat motif harboring tau lysine K311, 306VQIVYK311 (<Fig 2>). rhetorical Fig 2 The microtubule-binding repeats 1–4 from tau, MAP2c, and MAP4 were aligned and exact amino acid homology among the MAPs is depicted with red shading.

QBI-293 cells were employed for MAP acetylation experiments since these cells have low levels of tau/MAP2 and are therefore amenable to MAP expression studies without confounding levels of endogenous MAPs. MAP2c or MAP4 proteins were immunoprecipitated from co-transfected cells, and MAP acetylation was detected using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (<Fig 3A>). While MAP acetylation was undetectable in the absence of CBP, co-expression with CBP led to the accumulation of acetylated MAP2c and MAP4, which migrated as a series of acetylated protein bands ~ 65 kDa (MAP2c) and ~100 kDa (MAP4). rhetorical Fig 3 A) QBI-293 cells were co-transfected with MAP2c or MAP4-GFP expression plasmids in the presence of CBP to promote full acetylation, followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis using acetylated lysine, T46 or GFP antibodies. The monoclonal antibody T46 detects a highly conserved C-terminal epitope that is identical in tau and MAP2c proteins. B) Immunoprecipitation reactions from cells transfected with vector alone (lane 1), MAP2c alone (lane 2), MAP2c and CBP (lane 3), or MAP4 and CBP (lane 4) were performed with T46 or GFP antibodies. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained followed by gel band excision and analysis by mass spectrometry (NanoLC nanospray MS-MS, see <methods>). In the absence of CBP, no lysine acetylation was detected. In the presence of CBP, MAP2c and MAP4 acetylation sites were identified and full peptide details are listed in Tables <1> and <2>. Shown are representative immunoblots from N = 3 independent experiments. Coomassie staining, gel band excision, and mass spectrometry was performed in triplicate confirming the identity of acetylated lysine residues from three independent MAP acetylation experiments.

PMC5176320_3,"MAP2c and MAP4 acetylation was assessed by co-expression with the constitutively active acetyltransferase CBP, previously shown to acetylate tau isoforms with high affinity using in vitro and cell-based assays [<3>, <6>, <21>]  QBI-293 cells were employed for MAP acetylation experiments since these cells have low levels of tau/MAP2 and are therefore amenable to MAP expression studies without confounding levels of endogenous MAPs.

While MAP acetylation was undetectable in the absence of CBP, co-expression with CBP led to the accumulation of acetylated MAP2c and MAP4, which migrated as a series of acetylated protein bands ~ 65 kDa (MAP2c) and ~100 kDa (MAP4).To identify acetylated lysine residues, large-scale transfections in the presence of CBP were used to immunopurify acetylated MAP2c and MAP4 proteins, yielding highly purified MAPs, as determined by Coomassie staining of eluted fractions. Approximately 5–10 μg of total purified MAPs were isolated from cell extracts (<Fig 3B>). Our MAP enrichment strategy enabled highly sensitive detection of lysine acetylation by mass spectrometry analysis upon gel excision and subsequent acetylated peptide mapping using nanoLC/nanospray/MS/MS. We note that incorporation of the deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and nicotinamide (NCA), which block HDAC/sirtuin family members, was critical to preserve MAP acetylation status throughout the MAP extraction and isolation process.Acetylated lysine-containing peptides were identified for both MAP2c (<Table 1> and <S1 Fig>) and MAP4 (<Table 2>), many of which clustered within the MTBR regions similar to tau proteins (<Fig 2>). This observation was despite the fact that lysine residues are distributed throughout MAP2c and MAP4, suggesting specificity for acetylation within the MTBR. We observed several regions within the MTBRs of MAP2c and MAP4 that represent putative acetylation motifs (<Fig 2>, see motifs highlighted by solid black lines). In repeat 1, we identified a conserved lysine-rich cluster [K-N-V-K/R-S-K] in which either 2 or 3 lysines were acetylated in both MAP2c and MAP4. Further acetylation site comparisons identified a more general consensus motif [V-Q/K-I-X-X-X/K-K] present at the N-terminus of MAP2c repeats 3/4 and MAP4 repeats 2/3/4, in which several acetylated lysines were enriched. Consistent with these two regions acting as putative MAP acetylation motifs, tau proteins are similarly acetylated in repeat 1 at residue K259 [254K-N-V-K-S-K259] [<4>], repeat 2 at residues K280 and K281 [275V-Q-I-I-N-K-K281] [<3>, <22>], and repeat 3 at residue K311 (306V-Q-I-V-Y-K311) [<3>]. Thus, two distinct lysine-rich motifs within the MTBR emerged as conserved hot-spots that are particularly susceptible to acetylation, possibly due to distinct conformation and/or increased lysine accessibility within these regions. While previous studies have suggested that tau acetylation occurs in trans by CBP/p300 [<3>, <5>, <6>, <21>], evidence also indicates that tau auto-acetylation occurs upon incubation of tau proteins with acetyl-CoA alone [<21>]. Thus, to further confirm MAP acetylation and to determine if the recently described tau auto-acetylation mechanism also applies to MAP2, a truncated MAP2c fragment encompassing the MAP2 MTBR (residues 280–398) was generated and analyzed by in vitro acetylation reactions with radiolabeled [14C]-acetyl-CoA. Tau and MAP2c acetylation reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. In agreement with our previous study [<21>], the tau-K18 fragment comprising the 4-repeat tau region (residues 244–372), showed robust auto-acetylation, an effect that was similarly observed with the homologous MAP2c MTBR fragment (<Fig 4A>). rhetorical Fig 4 A) Recombinant tau-K18 (residues 244–372) or MAP2c (residues 280–388) fragments were incubated in acetylation reactions containing [14C]-labeled acetyl-CoA followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging using Storm software to detect radiolabeled MAPs. B) Immunoprecipitated 2N4R tau (lane 1), 2N4R-2CA mutant tau (lane 2), or MAP2c proteins (lane 6) derived from QBI-293 lysates were immobilized on agarose beads, incubated with [14C]-Acetyl-CoA, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining followed by phosphorimaging analysis. Replicate IgG control samples (lanes 3–5) were used to clearly separate signal intensities from tau and MAP2c sample lanes. C) Purified MTBR fragments from wild-type MAP2c (280–388), a comparable MAP2c fragment containing a cysteine→alanine substitution (C348A), or MAP4 (925–1102) were incubated in acetylation reactions and direct incorporation of radiolabeled acetyl groups was quantified using a liquid scintillation analyzer. Shown are representative analysis using N = 3 technical replicates from N = 3 independent experiments. While previous studies have suggested that tau acetylation occurs in trans by CBP/p300 [<3>, <5>, <6>, <21>], evidence also indicates that tau auto-acetylation occurs upon incubation of tau proteins with acetyl-CoA alone [<21>]. Thus, to further confirm MAP acetylation and to determine if the recently described tau auto-acetylation mechanism also applies to MAP2, a truncated MAP2c fragment encompassing the MAP2 MTBR (residues 280–398) was generated and analyzed by in vitro acetylation reactions with radiolabeled [14C]-acetyl-CoA.

In agreement with our previous study [<21>], the tau-K18 fragment comprising the 4-repeat tau region (residues 244–372), showed robust auto-acetylation, an effect that was similarly observed with the homologous MAP2c MTBR fragment (<Fig 4A>).To independently confirm MAP2c auto-acetylation, we isolated transfected tau or MAP2c using immunoprecipitation pull-downs and performed auto-acetylation reactions on MAPs bound to affinity beads, which showed that isolated full-length tau (2N4R) and MAP2c are both capable of self-acetylation upon incubation with acetyl-CoA (<Fig 4B>). As a negative control, a cysteine-less tau mutant (2N4R-2CA) that impairs auto-acetylation showed no detectable radiolabeling [<21>]. Finally, direct incorporation of [3H]-acetyl groups onto MAP2c and MAP4 lysine residues was measured by quantification of radiolabeled fragments using a filter-binding assay that traps low-molecular weight MAP fragments but not free unconjugated [3H]-acetyl-CoA. MAP2c and MAP4 fragments that span the MTBR showed significant acetylation, which increased linearly as a function of increasing concentration of acetyl-CoA from 2.5–800 μM (<Fig 4C>). The additional 2nd MTBR repeat present in MAP4, but not MAP2c, may account for the increased MAP4 acetylation observed at most acetyl-CoA concentrations. Notably, mutation of the single MAP2c cysteine residue to an alanine (C348A) abrogated acetylation, strongly supporting cysteine-mediated auto-acetylation [<21>]. Together, these data suggest that CBP-catalyzed acetylation and chemical auto-acetylation are conserved among MAP2/Tau family proteins. One primary function of MAPs is to bind and stabilize MTs [<13>], mediated partly via MTBR lysines that associate with MTs [<10>]. The presence of tubulin is expected to engage MAP lysine residues and therefore limit lysine accessibility required for acetyl group transfer. Thus, we asked whether MAP acetylation still occurred in the presence of increasing concentrations of tubulin. Purified MAP-rich brain fractions containing full-length MAP2 (250 kDa isoform) were incubated with purified tubulin, which led to progressively reduced MAP2 acetylation detected by [14C]-acetyl-CoA labeling (<Fig 5A>). Similarly, immunoblotting with anti-acetylated lysine antibodies showed reduced MAP2 acetylation and a simultaneous reduction of tau acetylation at residue K280 using the acetylated tau-specific antibody ac-K280 (<Fig 5B>)."

Active MAPs are known to stabilize MTs leading to prominent MT bundling or cabling, as detected by tubulin immunoreactivity [<23>–<25>]. While MT bundles still formed under all conditions tested, CBP-catalyzed acetylation of tau, MAP2c, or MAP4 (<Fig 6>, panels a-b, e-f, i-j) resulted in less prominent and less elaborated MT bundles compared to the baseline MAP activity observed with the inactive CBP-LD mutant (<Fig 6>, panels c-d, g-h, k-l), as observed by immunofluorescence with an acetylated tubulin antibody. Supporting this observation, further biochemical analysis by immunoblotting showed a reduction in either MAP2 or MAP4-mediated MT stabilization when these MAPs were acetylated in the presence of active CBP (<Fig 6>, panels m-o). Finally, we analyzed MAP2 in primary neurons differentiated from 4–22 days in vitro (DIV). Using a pan-acetyl-lysine antibody, we observed an increase in acetylated MTs (~ 55 kDa), which correlated with an apparent reduction of MAP2 acetylation-immunoreactive bands (~ 70 kDa) in mature neurons from 11–22 DIV (<S2 Fig>). Taken together, these results support the notion that lysine acetylation of MAPs within the MTBR can inhibit MAP-dependent MT stabilization. rhetorical Fig 6 QBI-293 cells were transfected with 2N4R-tau (panels a-d), MAP2c (panels e-h), or MAP4 (panels i-l) in the presence of wild-type CBP (top row) or an inactive CBP-LD mutant (bottom row). MT bundling in MAP-transfected cells (green) was determined 48 hr later by acetylated tubulin immunofluorescence (red), an indicator of MAP-induced MT stabilization.

Taken together, these results support the notion that lysine acetylation of MAPs within the MTBR can inhibit MAP-dependent MT stabilization. Here, we provide the first evidence for conserved lysine acetylation as a mechanism regulating MAP2/Tau family members. Although acetylation has traditionally been viewed in the context of histones and gene transcription, recent proteomics approaches have identified acetylated targets in the cytoplasm and other organelles [<15>]. For example, the mitochondria harbors >100 acetylated targets encompassing 20% of total mitochondrial proteins [<26>], highlighting an emerging acetylation landscape. Several acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) are enriched in the cytoplasm and are firmly associated with MTs [<16>, <18>], suggesting that in addition to tubulin acetylation, cytosolic acetylated substrates may regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and coordinate cytoplasmic signaling events. Indeed, global proteomics analysis in cell culture and a variety of mouse tissues indicate prominent acetylation of cytoskeletal proteins including actin and microtubule-associated factors [<15>, <27>, <28>].Our previous mass spectrometry analysis of either recombinant tau proteins or purified tau isolated from cultured cells identified four major acetylation sites in cells (K163, K280, K281, and K369) and several additional in vitro acetylation sites, most of which cluster within the tau MTBR [<3>], an observation that was recently validated and extended in vivo using wild-type mouse brain [<7>]."
PMC5176320_5,"Since tau proteins have emerged as a dominant acetylated substrate, we investigated acetylation of the related MAP2 and MAP4 proteins, which contain sequence and structural homology [<13>]  Using a cell-based MAP purification method, we identified a series of acetylated MAP2 and MAP4 lysines, many of which cluster in the lysine-rich MTBR that regulates MAP-MT binding.We reveal at least two novel acetylation motifs that show a striking conservation among MAP2 family members: [K-N-V-K/R-S-K] and [V-Q/K-I-X-X-X/K-K]. Consistent with enhanced acetylation at lysine-rich motifs, recent studies indicate that lysine acetylation preferentially occurs in a general lysine-rich local environment, in which neighboring lysines facilitate primary lysine acetylation [<27>, <29>]. Secondly, the acetylated lysines identified in our study often contain I/V residues at positions P+2 or P-2 (e.g. 332VQIVTKK/I339 in MAP2c) or D/E residues at positions ranging from P-4 to P+4 (e.g. 363VKIESVK/LD371 in MAP2c) relative to the primary acetylated lysine. In the latter scenario, such a configuration may act to enhance local acetylation by lowering the pKa of the substrate lysine, which was recently suggested by global acetylation mapping studies [<27>, <30>].It is currently unclear why MAPs are redundantly acetylated at the N-terminus of repeats 2–4 within the general [V-Q/K-I-X-X-X/K-K] consensus acetylation motif. High resolution NMR analysis indicates that the beginning of the tau repeats represent strong binding sites for microtubules [<31>, <32>], suggesting acetylation could provide reversible regulatory control over MAP-MT binding. While the number of repeats is important for MT stabilization (i.e. four repeats bind MTs with higher affinity than three repeats), their order may not be critical [<33>]. In fact, using tau proteins, one can change the connection between flanking regions and repeats, and one can even swap repeats without a major effect on tau-MT binding [<33>]. Thus, MAP-MT interactions could be distributed independently and spread over the entire repeat region, consistent with a weak MT binding model for tau [<34>]. Based on our results, it is plausible that each repeat could be regulated independently, potentially via specific acetylation events within the N-terminal [V-Q/K-I-X-X-X/K-K] motifs.Tau residues K280 and K281 in the 2nd repeat, in particular, make an unusually large contribution to MT-binding that is abrogated upon neutralization via lysine acetylation [<3>, <10>]. Furthermore, both K280 and K281 can undergo acetylation individually, or in tandem (i.e. doubly acetylated), suggesting that any steric effects of individually acetylated lysines may not impair, but rather might actually promote, subsequent acetylation locally within the repeats (TJC, unpublished observations). Supporting the conservation of acetylation at tau K280/K281 in other MAPs, the homologous double lysines in the 3rd repeat of MAP2c (332VQIVTKK338), the 2nd repeat of MAP4 (992VQIVSKK998) and the 3rd repeat of MAP4 (1023VQIQNKK1029) are all targeted by acetylation, either singly or doubly, in an analogous manner (<Fig 2>, Tables <1> and <2>). Our results support the notion of independent MT interactions among the individual repeats and are consistent with double lysine-containing motifs, in particular, contributing to strong electrostatic interactions with MTs, as originally proposed for tau [<10>, <33>]. These are the same lysines that are also subject to acetylation, likely providing regulation of MAP function and MT dynamics.While we and others have shown that CBP catalyzes tau acetylation with high affinity in trans [<3>, <5>, <6>, <21>], CBP/p300 is not prominently localized to the neuronal cytoplasm where tau and related MAPs are enriched [<35>]. Alternatively, evidence also indicates that MAP auto-acetylation can occur in the presence of acetyl-CoA alone (<Fig 3>) [<21>]. Although this phenomenon is not fully characterized, many acetyltransferases control their own catalytic activity via positive feedback auto-acetylation [<36>–<41>]. We previously showed that tau can transfer acetyl groups onto its own lysine residues [<21>], a mechanism that appears to be conserved among MAP2 family members (<Fig 4>), which is consistent with the mechanism previously proposed for MYST and N-arylamine (NAT)-family acetyltransferases [<42>, <43>], to which MAPs have some limited sequence homology [<21>]. A recent global proteomics study indicated that many acetylated substrates undergo chemical auto-acetylation in the apparent absence of acetyltransferase activity [<30>], in which case lysine specificity may be controlled instead by lysine accessibility, specific lysine pKa values, and the presence of basic residues preceding the acetylated lysine. Thus, the lysine-rich MTBRs, and in particular the double lysine-containing regions described here, may represent conserved sites of auto-regulated chemical acetylation once MAPs have disengaged from MTs, a PTM that would likely negatively regulate MAP-MT binding. Future studies to identify and characterize putative MAP2 family acetyltransferase(s) could further shed light on the contribution of auto-regulated chemical acetylation vs. enzyme-catalyzed acetylation within the critical MTBR domain.In summary, we provide evidence for conservation of lysine acetylation among MAP2/Tau family proteins. Future efforts to dissect how acetylation regulates MAP conformation or binding affinity could provide insight into MT dynamics, particularly during neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, or under neurodegenerative conditions when MT regulation is particularly dynamic and vulnerable. Lastly, our study could uncover site-specific MAP acetylation at particular lysine residues (or combinations thereof) as a critical factor in disease pathogenesis that may distinguish tau from its close relatives, which could factor into the selective tau toxicity observed in AD and related tauopathies. Lysine acetylation has emerged as a dominant post-translational modification (PTM) regulating tau proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Mass spectrometry studies indicate that tau acetylation sites cluster within the microtubule-binding region (MTBR), a region that is highly conserved among tau, MAP2, and MAP4 family members, implying that acetylation could represent a conserved regulatory mechanism for MAPs beyond tau. Here, we combined mass spectrometry, biochemical assays, and cell-based approaches to demonstrate that the tau family members MAP2 and MAP4 are also subject to reversible acetylation. We identify a cluster of lysines in the MAP2 and MAP4 MTBR that undergo CBP-catalyzed acetylation, many of which are conserved in tau. Similar to tau, MAP2 acetylation can occur in a cysteine-dependent auto-regulatory manner in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Furthermore, tubulin reduced MAP2 acetylation, suggesting tubulin binding dictates MAP acetylation status. Taken together, these results uncover a striking conservation of MAP2/Tau family post-translational modifications that could expand our understanding of the dynamic mechanisms regulating microtubules. ."
PMC3391724_0,"Aggregated filamentous forms of hyperphosphorylated tau (a microtubule-associated protein) represent pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. While axonal transport dysfunction is thought to represent a primary pathogenic factor in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the direct molecular link between pathogenic forms of tau and deficits in axonal transport remain unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that filamentous, but not soluble, forms of wild-type tau inhibit anterograde, kinesin-based fast axonal transport (FAT) by activating axonal protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), independent of microtubule binding. Here, we demonstrate that amino acids 2–18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway in axoplasms isolated from squid giant axons. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Importantly, immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity, an early marker of pathological tau. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT. Results from these studies reveal a novel role for tau in modulating axonal phosphotransferases and provide a molecular basis for a toxic gain-of-function associated with pathogenic forms of tau. This work was supported by NIH Grants T32 AG020506-07 (N.M.K.); AG09466 (L.I.B.); and NS23868, NS23320, and NS41170 (S.T.B.); as well as 2007/2008 MBL Summer Research Fellowships and an ALS/CVS Therapy Alliance grant (G.M.). We thank Alena Leitman, Sarah Berth, Agnieska Kaminska, Lisa Baker, Meryl Horn, Alex Sturbaum, and Yuka Atagi of the Brady and Morfini laboratories, who participated in our research at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). We would also like to thank Juan Reyes for preparing some of the human tau samples and John Hardy (University College, London, UK) for drawing our attention to the Δ144–273 FTD mutation. Aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau represent major pathological components in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies (<Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986>; <Wood et al., 1986>) and correlate with progressive cognitive decline in AD (<Kosik et al., 1986>; <Arriagada et al., 1992>; <Giannakopoulos et al., 2003>). The identification of tau mutations in hereditary tauopathies directly link tau to neurodegeneration (<Goedert and Jakes, 2005>). However, the molecular mechanisms behind tau-mediated toxicity remain unclear.Axonal transport dysfunction is implicated as a critical pathogenic factor in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (<Roy et al., 2005>; <Morfini et al., 2009>). Experiments in isolated squid axoplasm revealed that aggregated WT tau selectively inhibited kinesin-based anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT) at physiological levels, while soluble WT tau monomers did not, even at concentrations >10-fold higher than physiological levels (<LaPointe et al., 2009>; <Morfini et al., 2009>). The toxic effect of aggregated tau on anterograde FAT involved activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). Deletion experiments suggested that this effect required amino acids 2–18 of tau (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). However, these studies did not explain why monomeric, soluble tau did not inhibit FAT.Findings on the conformation of soluble tau provided a potential explanation for this apparent paradox. Originally, tau was considered a “natively unfolded” protein with little secondary structure in solution (<Schweers et al., 1994>). However, recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies suggest that soluble WT tau monomers adopt a “paperclip” conformation involving close interactions of the C terminus with the microtubule binding repeats (MTBRs) and the N terminus with the C terminus (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>). Pathological forms of tau appear to alter the paperclip conformation. For example, the AT8 phosphoepitope (Ser199/Ser202/Thr205) found in AD and other tauopathies reduced folding of the N terminus into the paperclip conformation (<Jeganathan et al., 2008>). Similarly, a tau mutation in a patient with inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD) results in deletion of the “hinge” region that is crucial for N-terminal folding (<Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2009>), rendering this mutant tau protein incapable of assuming the paperclip conformation. These observations suggest that disease-associated tau modifications disrupt the paperclip conformation, but molecular mechanisms linking disruptions in tau conformation to inhibition of FAT remained unknown.We present evidence indicating that disease-associated modifications in tau that impair the paperclip conformation inhibit anterograde FAT. Results from our experiments suggest that amino acids 2–18 of tau, a domain we refer to as the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), represent a biologically active protein motif capable of activating the PP1–GSK3 pathway. The relevance of these findings to AD was validated using a novel PAD-specific antibody to document increased PAD exposure early in the course of disease. Based on these results, we propose a model of pathogenesis where modifications in tau, including aggregation, hyperphosphorylation, and FTD-associated mutation all result in increased PAD exposure, activation of the PP1–GSK3 pathway, and inhibition of anterograde FAT. Collectively, our findings provide a common molecular basis for the toxic gain-of-function mechanism associated with biochemically distinct disease-related modifications of tau. The following reagents were purchased from commercial vendors: okadaic acid (catalog #495604, EMD Chemicals) and inhibitor 2 (I-2; catalog #539638, EMD Chemicals); PAD peptide (amino acids 2–18) and scrambled PAD peptide (both with >98% purity) (GenScript); and Complete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor tablets (catalog #11873580001, Roche). ING-135 (<Kozikowski et al., 2007>) was generous gift from Dr. A. Kozikowski (University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL). Tau proteins are numbered according to the largest adult human isoform (ht40; 441 aa) in the CNS. Full-length ht40 (WT tau) was generated from previously described pT7c plasmids (<Fig. 1A>) (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II Kit, catalog #200524, Stratagene) was used to create point mutations in full-length tau constructs. Ser199, Ser202, and Thr205 were mutated to glutamic acid (E) to create the AT8 pseudophosphorylated mutant protein (AT8 tau) (<Fig. 1B>). Amino acids 144–273 (Δ144–273 tau) (<Fig. 1C>) were deleted by inserting EcoRV restriction sites flanking the appropriate region of the cDNA. Following EcoRV digestion and T4 ligation (New England Biolabs; used according to manufacturer’s instructions), the remaining EcoRV site was removed via deletion using the Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit described above. The 6D tau and 6P tau constructs were generated from previously described pT7c plasmid cDNAs (<Fig. 1D,E>) (<Luo et al., 2004>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>). A 6D protein with amino acids 2–18 deleted (Δ 2–18 6D tau) (<Fig. 1F>) was created by restriction digestion and ligation of 6D and Δ2–18 tau cDNAs, both of which have been described previously (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). The tau cDNA plasmid constructs were amplified in XL-1 blue supercompetent Escherichia coli, purified with the Qiagen Miniprep kit, and cDNA sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. T7 express supercompetent E. coli cells were used to express tau constructs, and the proteins were purified through His-tag high-affinity resin and size exclusion chromatography as previously described (<Carmel et al., 1996>)."
PMC3391724_1,"Freshly extruded axoplasms from squid giant axons (Loligo pealii; Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA) were used to measure axonal transport, as described previously (<Morfini et al , 2007>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>). Tau proteins were diluted in X/2 buffer (175 mm potassium aspartate, 65 mm taurine, 35 mm betaine, 25 mm glycine, 10 mm HEPES, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm ATP, pH 7.4) and perfused into isolated axoplasms at a final concentration of 2 µm. Use of tau proteins at 2 µm was specifically chosen since this is within the physiological levels of tau in brains (<Alonso et al., 1996>; <King et al., 1999>) and is within the physiological range of tau monomer/tubulin dimer ratios (<Drubin et al., 1985>; <Morfini et al., 2007>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>). A Zeiss Axiomat microscope equipped with a 100× objective (1.3 numerical aperture) and differential interference contrast optics, equipped for digital video processing and analysis was used to visualize vesicle motility (<Brady et al., 1993>). Anterograde and retrograde transport were measured by matching vesicle speed to calibrated cursors over 50 min as described previously (<Brady et al., 1993>; <Morfini et al., 2002b>). Recombinant GST-c-Jun (75 µg) was incubated with 10 µg of recombinant p38α (a generous gift from Dr. D. Bosco, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA) in the presence of 100 µm
32P-radiolabeled ATP in a 20 µl volume. After 1 h at 30°C, the resulting 32P-c-Jun samples were stored at −20°C until used in phosphatase assays.First, a control experiment was run to confirm that endogenous axoplasmic phosphatases could dephosphorylate 32P-c-Jun. Squid axoplasm was incubated with 32P-c-Jun (1 µg) for 0 min (input) or 30 min (control), and with okadaic acid (1 µm) or I-2 (400 nm) for 30 min. To determine whether PAD affects phosphatase activity, sister axoplasms were extruded on coverglasses and perfused with 35 µl of either PAD or scrambled PAD peptides (10 µm each) in buffer X/2 supplemented with 1 mm ATP plus 1 µg of 32P-cJun. A 4 µl aliquot of perfusate was removed at 10, 20, and 30 min, and was transferred to tubes containing 9 µl of sample buffer. Samples were run by SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried, and 32P incorporation in GST-cJun was analyzed with the Typhoon PhosphorImager. Sister axoplasms were extruded on coverglasses and perfused with 30 µl of either PAD or scrambled PAD peptides (10 µm) in buffer X/2 supplemented with 1 mm ATP. After 45 min of incubation, 12 µl aliquots of perfusate containing solubilized axoplasmic proteins were removed from each axon; diluted to 80 µl with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm EDTA, 2 µm okadaic acid, and 1/80 protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma); and kept on ice. Aliquots of diluted perfusates (20 µl) were supplemented with either 200 µm GSK3 substrate peptide (GSM, catalog #12-533, Millipore) or with 50 µm myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) (catalog #454880, Calbiochem), and the final volume adjusted to 32 µl with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Kinase reactions were started by adding 8 µl of 5X kinase buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm K aspartate, 50 mm MgCl2, and 500 µm
32P-radiolabeled ATP). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, aliquots were spotted on P81 cellulose paper in duplicate. Papers were washed three times in 100 mm phosphoric acid, and 32P incorporation into peptides was measured by scintillation counting. GSK3 activity was expressed as the ratio of incorporation between GSM and MARCKS peptides for each condition. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic PAD peptide (C2AEPRQEFEVMEDHAGTY18) conjugated to KLH (GenScript) as previously described (<Reyes et al., 2008>). Briefly, BALB/c female mice (catalog #001026, Jackson Laboratories) were immunized subcutaneously with peptides every 21 d over a 5 month period; splenocytes were then removed and fused to SP2/o myeloma cells. Positive clones that reacted specifically with PAD by ELISA analysis (<Reyes et al., 2008>) were selected, and then subcloned four times at limiting dilutions and isotyped [tau N-terminal 1 (TNT1) is an IgG1]. Antibody production was accomplished in a CELLine Classic 1000 bioreactor (DC-90005, Sartorius AG) before protein A purification at high pH. The sensitivity and specificity of the TNT1 antibody for PAD in tau was assessed using ELISAs and Western blotting (see <Fig. 7A>). Fresh frozen frontal cortex from control (n = 4) and severe AD (n = 5) brains was obtained from the Brain Bank of the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Northwestern University. Heat-stable/acid-soluble tau was extracted based on protocols described before (<Reyes et al., 2008>). Sarkosyl-insoluble tau [paired helical filaments (PHF)] and Sarkosyl-soluble tau were obtained using methods similar to those in previous reports (<Hasegawa et al., 1992>). For Western blot analysis, soluble and insoluble tau samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, as described previously (<Reyes et al., 2008>). For dot blots, soluble and insoluble tau samples were spotted directly onto nitrocellulose membranes (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). Both Western and dot blot membranes were blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, and incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The Tau12 (<Horowitz et al., 2004>) and TNT1 mouse monoclonal antibodies were diluted from 1 mg/ml purified stock solutions to 1:500,000 and 1:300,000, respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antibody, R1 tau (<Berry et al., 2004>), was diluted 1:300,000 from a 1 mg/ml stock. After rinsing, the membranes were incubated in peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (PI-2000, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Reactivity was visualized using ECL substrate (PI32106, Pierce), and Western blots were visualized on Kodak Bio-max XAR film, while dot blots were imaged on the Kodak Imaging Station 4000R for quantification of signal intensity. Data are expressed as the ratio of TNT1/Tau12 intensity. Tissue sections (40 µm thick) from the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, inferior temporal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus of control (Braak stages I–II; n = 4) and severe AD (Braak stages V–VI; n = 4) cases were obtained through the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center at Northwestern University. All sections were stained simultaneously to reduce variability in tissue processing. Sections were processed as previously described (<Kanaan et al., 2007>). The TNT1 primary antibody was diluted 1:400,000 (from 1 mg/ml stock) and incubated with the tissue sections overnight at 4°C. The tissue was incubated in biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:500; BA-9200, Vector Laboratories) for 2 h, followed by incubation in ABC solution (PK-6100, Vector Laboratories; used according to manufacturer’s instructions) for 1 h. The staining was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (D5637, Sigma). All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted, and each step was followed by 6 × 10 min rinses in TBS-0.5% Triton X-100. After developing the stain, the tissue sections were mounted and coverslipped. Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope equipped with a DS-Ri1 camera and Nikon Elements AR 3.10 software. Figures were generated using Adobe Photoshop. Tissue sections (as described above) from the hippocampus of control (Braak stages I–II; n = 4), mild AD (Braak stages III–IV; n = 5), and severe AD (Braak stages V–VI; n = 4) cases were processed for double-label immunofluorescence using TNT1 and the AT8 antibody (<Biernat et al., 1992>; <Goedert et al., 1995>). All sections were stained simultaneously using similar methods as previously described (<Kanaan et al., 2007>) to reduce variability in tissue processing. The TNT1 primary antibody was diluted 1:40,000 (from 1 mg/ml stock) and incubated with the tissue sections overnight at 4°C."
PMC3391724_2,"The tissue was incubated in Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG1 γ-chain-specific secondary antibody (diluted 1:500; A21125, Invitrogen) for 2 h, followed by blocking uncomplexed secondary antibody sites with 10% mouse serum for 1 h  Then the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with biotinylated AT8 antibody (MN1020B, Thermo Scientific) diluted at 1:1000. The AT8 antibody was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (diluted 1:500; S11223, Invitrogen) for 2 h. Sections were mounted and coverslipped using Vectashield Hardest (H-1400, Vector Laboratories). All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted, and each step was followed by 6 × 10 min rinses in TBS-0.5% Triton X-100. Images were taken using a fluorescence-equipped Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope with a Q-imaging Retiga-SRV Fast1394 camera and Nikon Elements AR 3.10 software (with live deblur function). Figures were generated using Adobe Photoshop. Each experiment was repeated at least three times (see figures for n values). Comparisons of vesicle motility rates were made using an unpaired t test or a one-way ANOVA, as indicated. The WT tau monomer group was used as the control group since no changes in motility rates are observed in this group compared with unperfused axoplasms (<Morfini et al., 2007>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>). When overall significance was reached, the Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc analysis was used to make all possible comparisons. Kinase assays with results were compared using a paired t test (paired by sister axoplasms). Significance was set at p < 0.01 or p < 0.05, as indicated. SigmaStat software (Systat Software) was used for all statistical tests. The isolated squid axoplasm is an ex vivo model system that allows for direct, quantitative evaluation of different effectors on anterograde (conventional kinesin-dependent) and retrograde (cytoplasmic dynein-dependent) FAT rates by video microscopy. When isolated axoplasm is perfused with aggregated tau, but not soluble tau monomers, there is a selective inhibition of anterograde FAT through an N-terminal-mediated mechanism involving activation of a PP1–GSK3 pathway, phosphorylation of kinesin light chains, and dissociation of kinesin-1 from its transported cargoes (<Morfini et al., 2004>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>).To explore the N-terminal dependence of tau-mediated FAT inhibition, we used the noncanonical N-terminal 6D and 6P tau isoforms (<Fig. 1D,E>). Both 6D and 6P are identical to WT tau from amino acids 1–143, but lack the proline-rich region, the MTBRs, and C terminus of full-length tau, and each protein contains a unique C-terminal 11 aa sequence (<Luo et al., 2004>; <Andreadis, 2005>). Thus, the 6D/6P isoforms can be used as physiological tools for the evaluation of the N terminus of tau in isolation from other functional domains and independent of microtubule binding or self-aggregation because both of these processes require the MTBRs.Vesicle motility assays in isolated axoplasm confirmed and expanded our initial results with the N-terminal isoforms of tau. As previously reported (<Morfini et al., 2007>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>), perfusion of full-length WT tau monomers (2 µm) (<Fig. 1A>) had no effect on FAT in squid axoplasm (<Fig. 2A>), while 6D and 6P tau monomers (2 µm) significantly inhibited anterograde FAT when compared with WT tau monomer (<Fig. 2B,C>) or buffer controls (data not shown). Neither 6D nor 6P tau (<Fig. 2D>) had an effect on retrograde FAT. Together, these data indicate that the proline-rich region, MTBRs, and the C terminus of full-length tau, as well as the unique 11 aa C termini of 6D and 6P do not play a role in inhibiting anterograde FAT. Since similar levels of FAT inhibition were obtained with 6D and 6P constructs (<Fig. 2C,D>), which are identical in the first 143 aa, we chose to focus on the 6D tau for further experimentation. Results from our previous work (<LaPointe et al., 2009>) prompted us to evaluate whether aggregated tau and 6D tau inhibited anterograde FAT through a common mechanism. To this end, we coperfused axoplasms with 6D tau and pharmacological inhibitors of either PP1 or GSK3. Coperfusion of 6D tau with I-2 (50 nm), a specific PP1 inhibitor, completely prevented the effects of 6D tau on anterograde FAT (<Fig. 3A,C>). Similarly, coperfusion of 6D tau with okadaic acid (200 nm), a less specific inhibitor of the major serine/threonine phosphatases (including both PP1 and PP2), prevented the inhibition of anterograde FAT elicited by 6D and 6P tau (data not shown). Furthermore, coperfusion of 6D tau and the GSK3-specific pharmacological inhibitor ING-135 (100 nm) (<Kozikowski et al., 2007>; <LaPointe et al., 2009>) completely blocked the inhibitory effects of 6D tau on anterograde FAT (<Fig. 3B,C>). Retrograde transport was not significantly affected in any experiment (<Fig. 3D>). Together, these data demonstrate that, as posited for aggregated tau (<LaPointe et al., 2009>), short N-terminal isoforms of tau inhibit anterograde FAT by a mechanism involving activation of PP1 and GSK3 that is independent of microtubule binding. Aggregated tau lacking amino acids 2–18 or PAD (Δ2–18) did not inhibit anterograde FAT (<LaPointe et al., 2009>), suggesting that this domain plays a critical role in the activation of the PP1–GSK3 pathway. To determine whether this domain mediates the inhibitory effects of 6D tau monomer on FAT, axoplasms were perfused with a recombinant 6D tau protein lacking PAD (Δ2–18 6D tau; 2 µm) (<Fig. 1F>). As observed with Δ2–18 tau aggregates (<LaPointe et al., 2009>), monomeric Δ2–18 6D tau showed no effect on FAT (<Fig. 4A,D>), demonstrating that PAD is necessary for 6D tau-mediated inhibition of anterograde FAT.We next sought to determine whether PAD is sufficient to induce anterograde FAT inhibition or whether other tau domains are also required. Isolated axoplasms were perfused with a synthetic PAD peptide (AEPRQEFEVMEDHAGTY) (<Fig. 1G>) or with a scrambled control PAD peptide (AQEMDRVYEGEAPHTFE) (<Fig. 1H>) at the same concentration (2 µm). The PAD peptide selectively inhibited anterograde FAT (<Fig. 4B,D>), but not retrograde FAT (<Fig. 4B,E>). In contrast, the scrambled PAD peptide had no effect on FAT in either direction (<Fig. 4C–E>). Together, these data demonstrate that the PAD in the N-terminal region of tau is both necessary and sufficient to induce inhibition of anterograde FAT. We next evaluated whether FAT inhibition induced by the PAD peptide involved activation of PP1 and GSK3 as observed with 6D tau (above) and aggregated tau (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). Again, coperfusion of the PAD peptide with either I-2 (50 nm) (<Fig. 5A>) or ING-135 (100 nm) (<Fig. 5B>) completely prevented anterograde FAT inhibition. Anterograde (<Fig. 5C>) and retrograde (<Fig. 5D>) FAT rates observed after coperfusion of the tau PAD peptide with either I-2 or ING-135 were indistinguishable from those observed after perfusion of soluble WT tau.The effect of the PAD peptide on the activity of endogenous axoplasmic phosphatases was evaluated using a phosphatase activity assay (<Fig. 5E,F>). In this assay, a recombinant GST-tagged c-Jun construct was phosphorylated with p38 kinase in the presence of γ32P-ATP for use as a phosphatase substrate. Isolated axoplasms were perfused with radiolabeled c-Jun (32P-c-Jun), and aliquots of the perfusates were collected at various time points and separated by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiograph analysis showed a marked reduction in 32P-c-Jun signal after 30 min of incubation, indicating the action of axonal phosphatases. The reduction was completely abolished by okadaic acid and, to a lesser extent, by I-2, suggesting dephosphorylation of 32P-c-Jun by axoplasmic serine-threonine phosphatases (<Fig. 5E>). Next, two sister axoplasms were prepared from the same squid, and each was perfused with 32P-c-Jun and either the 2–18 or scrambled 2–18 peptides. Consistent with results from vesicle motility assays, 32P-c-Jun was dephosphorylated to a greater extent in PAD peptide-perfused axoplasms than their scrambled peptide-perfused counterpart (<Fig."
PMC3391724_3,"5F>), suggesting that the PAD peptide induced activation of endogenous axoplasmic phosphatases Kinase activity assays were used to determine the effect of the PAD peptide on axoplasmic GSK3. Sister axoplasms were treated with PAD peptide or scrambled peptide, and then aliquots of perfusate containing axoplasmic proteins were incubated with 32P-ATP and either a GSK3 (GSM peptide) or protein kinase C (MARCKS peptide) substrate. A trend of elevated GSK3 activity (~32%) relative to PKC activity (p = 0.28, paired t test; n = 3) was observed for axoplasms incubated with the PAD peptide (mean = 4.9 ± 2.5), compared with those incubated with scrambled peptide (mean = 3.7 ± 1.7), which supports the results from vesicle motility assays. Reduced sensitivity to changes in GSK3 activity may likely be a result of PAD affecting only a fraction of all available axoplasmic GSK3 enzymes. Collectively, these data indicate that PAD is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit anterograde FAT by activating the PP1–GSK3 cascade. Together, the above data suggest that increased exposure of PAD in the context of aggregated WT tau and 6D/6P tau isoforms, results in PP1-GSK3 activation and anterograde FAT inhibition, whereas PAD exposure is limited in soluble WT tau. Consistent with this notion, a paperclip conformation has been shown for soluble, monomeric WT tau (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>). This conformation involves intramolecular interactions between the C terminus and the MTBR, and between the extreme N terminus (containing PAD) and the C terminus. Folding of tau into the paperclip conformation may therefore limit exposure of PAD, preventing it from activating the PP1–GSK3 cascade. This model predicts that disease-related tau modifications in monomeric tau that alter the paperclip conformation may result in abnormal exposure of PAD and should be toxic to FAT. To test this possibility, we evaluated the effects of two disease-associated forms of tau, termed “AT8 tau” and “Δ144–273 tau” (<Fig. 1B,C>), on FAT.Pseudophosphorylation of tau at the AT8 epitope (comprised of Ser199, Ser202, and Thr205) reduces the folding of the N terminus into the paperclip conformation (<Jeganathan et al., 2008>), suggesting that phosphorylation of tau at these sites could increase PAD exposure. To determine whether AT8 phosphorylated tau monomers could inhibit anterograde FAT, we perfused AT8 pseudophosphorylated tau [Ser199Glu/Ser202Glu/Thr205Glu (AT8 tau)] (<Fig. 1B>) into isolated squid axoplasms. Soluble AT8 tau monomers inhibited anterograde FAT (<Fig. 6A,C>), while retrograde transport was unaffected (<Fig. 6A,D>). These data indicate that phosphorylation of tau at the AT8 epitope, which is associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD and other tauopathies, renders soluble monomeric tau capable of inhibiting anterograde FAT.A novel mutation in the tau gene associated with a case of FTD was recently reported (<Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2009>). This tau mutation results in deletion of amino acids 144–273 encompassing the proline-rich domain and the first MTBR (Δ144–273 tau) (<Fig. 1C>). Deletion of these tau domains should result in constitutive exposure of PAD because they play a pivotal role in the intramolecular folding of the N terminus. Consistent with our model, Δ144–273 tau monomers significantly inhibited anterograde FAT (<Fig. 6B,C>), while retrograde FAT remained unaffected (<Fig. 6B,D>). Together, these data indicate that disease-associated modifications and mutations in tau that increase exposure of PAD promote activation of the PP1–GSK3 pathway and inhibition of anterograde FAT. Results from isolated axoplasm experiments suggested a molecular basis for tau toxicity. To evaluate the relevance of these findings in human disease, we generated a novel monoclonal antibody, termed TNT1, which specifically recognizes PAD. The TNT1 antibody exhibits a very high affinity (EC50 = 5.5 ng/ml) for WT tau containing PAD (<Fig. 7A>) and does not react with tau missing PAD (Δ2–18 tau) in ELISAs [WT tau: mean absorbance at 450 nm (A450) = 2.4 ± 0.03; Δ2–18 tau: mean A450 = 0.003 ± 0.004] and immunoblots (<Fig. 7A>). Using the TNT1 antibody, we examined the availability of PAD in AD and control brains. First, we probed samples of soluble and insoluble tau isolated from the frontal cortex of control and severe AD cases using immunoblots. The pattern of TNT1 reactivity on Western blots was consistent with that of tau isolated from human brain as indicated by the Tau12 (<Horowitz et al., 2004>) and R1 tau antibodies (<Berry et al., 2004>) (two well characterized tau-specific antibodies), confirming the specificity of TNT1 for tau protein and not non-tau proteins in human brains (<Fig. 7B>). Under these denaturing conditions, TNT1 reacted similarly with soluble tau from controls and AD samples, as well as with insoluble tau from AD samples (<Fig. 7B>).To further explore the characteristics of TNT1 reactivity, we analyzed soluble and insoluble tau fractions using dot blots, which like Western blots are solid-state assays, but unlike Western blots the proteins are not denatured. In dot blots, TNT1 showed a significantly increased selectivity for both soluble and insoluble tau isolated from AD, as opposed to control brains (<Fig. 7C>). The lack of distinction between control and AD tau in denaturing conditions by TNT1, but significant selectivity for AD tau over control tau in non-denaturing conditions, highlights that TNT1 reactivity is indicative of PAD exposure, which is dependent upon maintaining protein conformation. Thus, these results suggest that PAD is more readily available in the native state of tau derived from AD brains, compared with tau derived from control brains, and TNT1 immunoreactivity can be used as an indicator of PAD exposure.Immunohistochemistry with TNT1 was performed on tissue sections from controls (Braak stages I–II; n = 4) and severe AD (Braak stages V–VI; n = 4) cases to determine when and where PAD exposure occurs in the disease process. Qualitative evaluation of sections from the entorhinal cortex (<Fig. 7D>) and hippocampus (<Fig. 7E>), as well as the inferior and superior temporal gyri (data not shown) indicated that TNT1 reactivity followed the typical pattern of Braak staging (<Braak and Braak, 1991>). In age-matched control cases, TNT1 diffusely labeled neurons in the earliest stages of tau deposition (e.g., early pretangle neurons), and a subset of these neurons contained small, darkly stained, globular intracellular inclusions (<Fig. 7F>). A small number of neurons in control cases exhibited strong TNT1 immunoreactivity of seemingly immature tangle-like inclusions that extended into both apical and basal dendrites (<Fig. 7F>). With progression into severe AD, there was a remarkable increase in the amount of TNT1 immunoreactive inclusions (<Fig. 7D,E>), which included neurofibrillary tangles (<Fig. 7G>), neuropil threads (<Fig. 7G>), and neuritic plaques (<Fig. 7H>). These data indicated that increased PAD exposure, as revealed by TNT1 immunoreactivity, occurs early in AD and remains present throughout the disease process.We next determined the relationship between PAD exposure and AT8 phosphorylation in tau since this modification rendered soluble tau monomers toxic to FAT (see above). Tissue sections from the hippocampus of controls (Braak stages I–II; n = 4), mild AD (Braak stages III–IV; n = 5), and severe AD (Braak stages V–VI; n = 4) were double stained with TNT1 and AT8 antibodies using immunofluorescence (<Fig. 7I–K>). Qualitative observations indicated that TNT1 immunoreactivity might appear slightly before the development of AT8 phosphorylation in the course of AD. Numerous TNT1-positive structures (e.g., cell bodies and threads) in control cases (<Fig. 7I>) did not appear to be AT8 positive. As pathology progressed into mild AD (<Fig. 7J>), the amount of both TNT1 and AT8 increased. Finally, in severe AD stages (<Fig. 7K>) both TNT1 and AT8 were abundant and exhibited nearly complete colocalization. It should be noted that when present, AT8 immunoreactivity was almost always colocalized with TNT1 in all cases analyzed."
PMC3391724_4,"Together, these data suggest that increased PAD exposure represents an early event in AD pathogenesis and that AT8 may not be required for PAD exposure in situ  Recently, we demonstrated that WT tau aggregates inhibit anterograde FAT by activating a PP1–GSK3 signaling cascade through a mechanism requiring the N terminus of tau (<LaPointe et al., 2009>). Extending those observations, we have identified a tau domain comprised of amino acids 2–18 that is both necessary and sufficient to activate the PP1–GSK3 cascade and inhibit anterograde FAT. These effects suggest a novel function for tau and define a new functional motif in tau, the PAD. Inhibition of anterograde FAT by the 6D and 6P isoforms of tau and a synthetic PAD peptide demonstrates that this effect does not require tau binding to microtubules or tau aggregation. Our results demonstrate that exposure of PAD is a critical factor mediating the ability of pathogenic forms of tau to inhibit FAT. Consistent with this hypothesis, two disease-associated tau modifications that increase PAD exposure inhibited anterograde FAT as soluble monomers. Further supporting the role of PAD exposure as an important disease-related event, the novel PAD-specific antibody TNT1 selectively labeled both soluble and insoluble tau isolated from AD brains, but not that from controls. Moreover, qualitative observations of TNT1 immunoreactivity in human AD tissue sections suggested that PAD exposure represents an early pathological event that closely associates in time with AT8 phosphorylation. These data have important implications regarding the role of tau in disease pathogenesis and provide a mechanism through which disease-associated modifications and/or mutations in tau lead to a toxic gain-of-function in AD and other tauopathies.The demonstration that PAD is a region within tau that can modulate the PP1–GSK3 cascade has significant implications for tau pathology and suggests a novel biological role for tau regulating the activity of phosphotransferases and anterograde FAT (<Fig. 8>). Tau has been shown to target PP1 to microtubules and can directly interact with PP1 (<Liao et al., 1998>). Amino acids 5–8, located within PAD, comprise one of the proposed PP1 binding sites in tau (<Liao et al., 1998>). Additionally, tau and GSK3β have been copurified as part of a high-molecular-weight complex in association with purified microtubules (<Sun et al., 2002>). Thus, in addition to microtubule stabilization, tau may bind and target phosphotransferases to the vicinity of microtubules (<Shahani and Brandt, 2002>) and regulate FAT through modulation of these enzymes (<Fig. 8A>), a functional scheme that may be disrupted in disease (<Fig. 8B>).Deficits in FAT have previously been implicated in the neuronal dysfunction associated with dysferopathies such as AD, non-AD tauopathies, and other neurodegenerative diseases (<Morfini et al., 2002a>, <2009>; <Roy et al., 2005>). In AD brains, dystrophic neurites, synaptic loss, and protein mislocalization (<Scheff et al., 1990>; <Dessi et al., 1997>) are all consistent with FAT deficits. Accordingly, studies in various animal models of AD and tauopathies have reported alterations in axonal transport (e.g., axonal swellings, synaptic loss, and impaired vesicle transport) (for review, see <Higuchi et al., 2006>). Interestingly, tau appears to play a critical role in amyloid-β-mediated axonal transport disruption, as genetically removing tau mitigates the effects of treating neurons with amyloid-β oligomers (<Vossel et al., 2010>). These studies suggested a link among tau, axonal dysfunction, and neurodegenerative disease; however, until this report the molecular mechanisms linking deficits in FAT to disease-related modifications of tau had remained unclear (<Morfini et al., 2002a>).Several studies on the role for tau in axonal transport dysfunction proposed a mechanism involving direct interference of tau with the binding of conventional kinesin to microtubules (<Ebneth et al., 1998>; <Seitz et al., 2002>; <Vershinin et al., 2007>). However, overexpression of human tau in transgenic mice did not affect FAT rates in the optic nerve (<Yuan et al., 2008>), and levels of soluble WT tau 20-fold greater than endogenous levels of tau had no effect on FAT in squid axoplasm (<Morfini et al., 2007>). Studies on aggregated tau (<LaPointe et al., 2009>) and the current data provide evidence for an alternative mechanism independent of microtubule binding that does not require aggregation. Specifically, many of the tau species examined in these studies do not effectively bind microtubules (e.g., tau aggregates, 6D/6P tau, PAD peptide, and FTD Δ144–273 tau), and many were used as monomers (e.g., 6D/6P tau, PAD peptide, FTD Δ144–273 tau, and AT8 tau). Moreover, we have established that tau inhibits anterograde FAT by activating the PP1–GSK3 cascade with nearly all of the tau species tested thus far. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that tau-mediated disruption of anterograde FAT via the PP1–GSK3 cascade is independent of microtubule binding and does not require aggregation.Based on our prior studies (<LaPointe et al., 2009>), it was unclear why monomeric WT tau failed to affect FAT even though the PAD motif was present. Tau was originally thought to exist in an extended random coil state based on spectroscopic studies (<Mandelkow et al., 2007>). However, fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies indicated that soluble monomeric WT tau adopts a folded paperclip conformation (<Jeganathan et al., 2006>, <2008>), that may prevent PAD from activating the PP1–GSK3 cascade. Conversely, conformations of tau that increase exposure of PAD should promote inhibition of anterograde FAT.We tested this hypothesis using numerous forms of tau in which the accessibility of PAD is increased. In tau aggregates, both termini of tau are believed to maintain a random coil structure extending from the filament core formed by the MTBRs (<Barghorn et al., 2004>). Evidence also suggests aggregated tau favors an Alz50-type conformation (<Carmel et al., 1996>), in which the N terminus is in close contact with the MTBRs. However, the results presented here suggest that the extreme N terminus of tau remains accessible in aggregated tau. The 6D and 6P isoforms of tau lack the MTBRs and C terminus (<Luo et al., 2004>) necessary for the paperclip conformation, leaving PAD constitutively available, and the PAD peptide is composed of only amino acids 2–18. Similarly, a recombinant pseudophosphorylated AT8 tau exhibits reduced folding of the N terminus into the paperclip conformation (<Jeganathan et al., 2008>). Finally, deletion of amino acids 144–273 in the FTD tau construct should dramatically reduce or eliminate the ability of the N terminus to fold into the paperclip, as this deletion removes the proline-rich hinge region involved in N-terminal folding. Consistent with our hypothesis, all of these “PAD-exposed” tau species inhibited anterograde FAT; thus, exposure of PAD provides a common mechanism of toxicity for biochemically heterogeneous forms of pathogenic tau.Highlighting the relevance of results obtained from studies in isolated squid axoplasm, a PAD-specific antibody (TNT1) that preferentially recognizes disease-related forms of tau confirmed the importance of PAD exposure in human disease pathogenesis. Data obtained from immunostaining studies in human brain tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure occurs very early in the process of tau inclusion formation and that AT8 is closely associated with PAD exposure during AD progression. Importantly, quantitative analyses are required to confirm our observations and conclusively determine the time course of PAD exposure in relation to other tau modifications during the progression of disease in humans. However, in combination with our squid axoplasm data, it is reasonable to assume that AT8 modification abundantly found in AD (<Braak et al., 1994>) and other tauopathies (<Takahashi et al., 2002>; <Sakai et al., 2006>; <Shiarli et al., 2006>) may facilitate PAD exposure and tau-mediated FAT dysfunction in situ."
PMC3391724_5,"Additionally, our data suggest a cyclical relationship between PAD exposure and AT8 phosphorylation in which the AT8 modification might result, at least in part, from the increased GSK3 activation triggered by abnormally exposed PAD, since S199, S202, and T205 are GSK3β phosphorylation sites Since neurons are thought to maintain function for years while bearing tau inclusions (<Morsch et al., 1999>), it is reasonable to assume the existence of compensatory mechanisms that render pathogenic forms of tau innocuous. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 18 (within PAD) by kinases such as fyn (<Lee et al., 2004>) or N-terminal cleavage of tau (<Horowitz et al., 2004>; <Sengupta et al., 2006>) may represent such protective mechanisms. <Jeganathan et al. (2008)> demonstrated that combinations of phosphorylation events have different effects on tau folding. While AT8 alone reduces N-terminal folding, AT8 in combination with the AT100 (T212/S214) and PHF-1 (S396/S404) phosphorylation epitopes causes tau to fold into a more compact paperclip conformation. Regulation of tau conformation through protein–protein or intraprotein interactions as well as through modifications like phosphorylation or proteolysis might be part of a complex set of events that regulate tau function, including microtubule binding, modulation of phosphotransferase-based signaling pathways, and anterograde FAT.Although tau has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target in AD and tauopathies, choosing therapeutic targets and testable outcome measures has proven difficult without an understanding of the mechanisms through which tau can influence disease progression. The identification of PAD and its effects on phosphotransferase activity and FAT regulation allow us to propose specific targets for intervention. For instance, reducing the activities of PP1 and/or GSK3 may reduce the toxic potential of pathogenic forms of tau. Alternatively, therapeutic strategies aimed at directly blocking PAD exposure and preventing it from activating the PP1–GSK3 cascade may provide yet another viable point of intervention. rhetorical Figure 1 A, Full-length wild-type ht40 (WT tau) is the largest isoform of tau found in the adult CNS.

Scale bars, 50 µm. rhetorical Figure 8 A, Tau is normally localized to microtubules where, in addition to stabilizing microtubules, it may regulate local cargo delivery through PAD-mediated activation of the PP1–GSK3 cascade. When tau is folded into the paperclip conformation, membrane-bound cargoes are transported by conventional kinesin along microtubules because PAD is hidden. In contrast, cargo is delivered at appropriate locations where tau is in an extended conformation and PAD is exposed. The exposure of PAD activates PP1-GSK3, leading to phosphorylation of kinesin light chains and release of cargoes. B, In disease states, tau aggregations and/or modifications expose PADs in tau that no longer binds to microtubules, promoting aberrant activation of the PP1–GSK3 cascade, increased inhibition of anterograde FAT, and ultimately neuron dysfunction/degeneration. Abnormal presentation of the biologically active PAD motif represents a critical factor in determining whether disease-associated forms of tau inhibit anterograde FAT. Aggregated filamentous forms of hyperphosphorylated tau (a microtubule-associated protein) represent pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. While axonal transport dysfunction is thought to represent a primary pathogenic factor in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the direct molecular link between pathogenic forms of tau and deficits in axonal transport remain unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that filamentous, but not soluble, forms of wild-type tau inhibit anterograde, kinesin-based fast axonal transport (FAT) by activating axonal protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), independent of microtubule binding. Here, we demonstrate that amino acids 2–18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway in axoplasms isolated from squid giant axons. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased exposure of PAD inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Importantly, immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased PAD exposure represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT8 immunoreactivity, an early marker of pathological tau. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased exposure of PAD, activation of PP1-GSK3, and inhibition of FAT. Results from these studies reveal a novel role for tau in modulating axonal phosphotransferases and provide a molecular basis for a toxic gain-of-function associated with pathogenic forms of tau. ."
PMC5537644_0,"Early identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk factors would aid development of interventions to delay the onset of dementia, but current biomarkers are invasive and/or costly to assess. Validated plasma biomarkers would circumvent these challenges. We previously identified the kinase DYRK1A in plasma. To validate DYRK1A as a biomarker for AD diagnosis, we assessed the levels of DYRK1A and the related markers brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and homocysteine in two unrelated AD patient cohorts with age-matched controls. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analyses showed that combined assessment of DYRK1A, BDNF and homocysteine has a sensitivity of 0.952, a specificity of 0.889 and an accuracy of 0.933 in testing for AD. The blood levels of these markers provide a diagnosis assessment profile. Combined assessment of these three markers outperforms most of the previous markers and could become a useful substitute to the current panel of AD biomarkers.

Moreover, DYRK1A regulation, synthesis and degradation are complex and tissue specific; for instance, in a mouse model of genetic hyperhomocysteinemia, less DYRK1A protein is detected in the liver and more is detected in the brain.<9>, <10>, <11>We recently showed in a well-characterized cohort of AD and age-matched controls (cohort P, Paris) that plasma DYRK1A levels were reduced in individuals with oligosymptomatic AD and with dementia due to AD.<12> Interestingly, lymphoblastoid cells from diploid individuals revealed a positive correlation between DYRK1A and BDNF levels.<13> BDNF levels are reported to be lower in the platelet-rich plasma of AD patients at moderate-to-severe stages of dementia compared with normal controls.<14> A meta-analysis of results obtained from AD cohorts reported a significant positive association between serum Hcy and the incidence of dementia.<15>With the hopes of expanding upon these results, we sought to assess the utility of DYRK1A as a biomarker of AD. We measured the DYRK1A plasma levels in a new cohort (cohort M, Munich) using a different method (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) from that of the first study, as well as a new antibody. Blood markers were measured in biologically and clinically defined AD patients along with age-matched controls from two cohorts (cohorts M and P).As DYRK1A, like many other kinases, is involved in controlling numerous pathways, we also measured markers linked to these pathways to investigate possible correlations between DYRK1A, BDNF, Hcy and soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ), an upstream product of the amyloid cascade leading to the production of amyloid β, a central constituent of amyloid plaques. We further investigated whether Hcy, BDNF and DYRK1A could function as composite biomarkers of AD. Cohort M (Munich): The controls (n=20) were individuals without subjective memory complaints and without neuropsychiatric disorders. They had normal cerebrospinal fluid concentration of Amyloid β 42, total tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, measured in duplicate with commercially available ELISA kits (<Table 1>). Thus, preclinical AD was precluded.<16> Recruitment and inclusion criteria of the patient sample have been described.<17> Outpatients (n=69) were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich. Patients had been referred by general practitioners, psychiatrists, other institutions or were self-referred. Controls and patients were Caucasian. Patients with oligosymptomatic AD fulfilled the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association diagnostic guidelines for mild cognitive impairment,<18> while patients with dementia met the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association criteria for dementia due to AD.<19> All the participants provided written informed consent and all clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, sixth revision.Cohort P (<Table 1>): recruitment and inclusion criteria of 25 controls and 26 patients, have been described previously.<12> Twenty-five controls and 25 patients were Caucasian; one AD patient was African.Cohorts M and P did not include subjects with severe cortical or subcortical vascular lesions. Average duration of the disease was similar in the two cohorts M and P (that is, 1–4 years for mild cognitive impairment, 3–8 years for AD). ApoE genotyping was described previously.<20>The blood samples were collected from participants into citrate containers, and the containers were immediately placed on ice until processed. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of containers for 15 min at 2000 g at 4 °C, then rapidly frozen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The plasma and serum aliquots were thawed on the same day of the experiment. The plasma was diluted at 1:20 in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. We conducted experimental animal study using mice carrying a murine BAC clone containing the entire Dyrk1a gene (maintained on a C57BL/6J background)<21> and Dyrk1a(+/−) mice maintained on a CD1 background.<22> Dyrk1a(+/−) and mBACtgDyrk1a mice were genotyped by PCR.<21>, <22> All the experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the European Union guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU) and the followed protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Parc Científic de Barcelona (PCB). Official authorization from the French Ministry of Agriculture was granted to carry out research and experiments on animals (authorization number 75–369) with approval by local ethical committee (Université Paris Diderot). In this study, we have used embryos of Dyrk1a(−/−) mice, Dyrk1a(+/−) mice and their wild-type littermates. The day of the vaginal plug was defined as E0.5. The proteins were prepared from E11 to E12 embryo heads.Adult mice were anesthetized and blood was collected through retro-orbital sinus sampling into tubes containing a 1/10 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. The plasma was isolated by centrifugation (2500 g). Immunogen preparation: the DNA sequence encoding human DYRK1A protein deleted in its C terminus (Δ502–763 further named Dyrk1AΔC) has been previously cloned and was used to prepare the protein.<23>Production of monoclonal antibodies: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced in ascitic fluid in BALB/C mice and further purified using caproic acid precipitation."
PMC5537644_1,"<24> The concentration and purity of mAbs were then assessed by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Coomassie blue staining in reducing and non-reducing conditions Evaluation of polyclonal response and screening of mAbs in hybridoma supernatants was performed following standard protocols (see <Supplementary Methods>).<25>, <26> After transfer, the membranes were saturated by incubation in 5% w/v nonfat milk powder in Tris-saline buffer (1.5 mm Tris base pH 8; 5 mm NaCl; 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with M01 antibody (1/250, Abnova, Tebu, France) and N6 antibody (1/2000) against DYRK1A. Binding of the primary antibody was detected by incubation with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu, France). Ponceau-S coloration was used as a loading control. Digitized images (LAS-3000 imaging system (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan)) were used for densitometric measurements with an image analyzer (UnScan-It software, Silk Scientific, Orem, UT, USA). The DYRK1A levels were assessed by a solid phase immobilized epitope-immunoassay set up for antibody M01 (Abnova; clone 7D10; immunogen: 674 aa~763 aa) and antibody N6.<27> BDNF was assessed using sandwich ELISA (ELISA E-Max, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After removal of unbound conjugates, bound enzyme activity was assessed by use of a chromogenic substrate for measurement at 450 nm by a microplate reader (Flex Station 3, Molecular Device, San Diego, CA, USA). All the assays were performed in duplicate. Plasma total (tHcy), defined as the total concentration of Hcy after quantitative reductive cleavage of all disulfide bonds, was assayed by using fluorimetric high-performance liquid chromatography as previously described.<28> The results are presented as mean±s.d. in all the tables. The normality of data distribution was tested with a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Statistical comparisons were performed with an unpaired t-test and two-tailed P-values for the comparison of means between two groups, which calculates the exact P-value and accounts for ties among values. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.Multivariate data analysis was performed through a principal component analysis (PCA), which helps the visualization of the association between biomarkers and patient status (control or AD). A PCA projects the standardized data, that is, the biomarker descriptors, into a subspace made of orthogonal linear axis, so-called principal components. Data may then be explored in a smaller dimensional space spanning the most informative view according to data variability.The analysis of the biomarkers of AD using a protein profile was first performed using different thresholds. We computed receiver–operating characteristic curves to evaluate the capacity of each plasma biomarker to discriminate subjects with AD from those without AD, using area under the curves.Biomarkers significantly associated to AD were then tested using models and cross-validation approaches based on the protein/Hcy profile data. Logistic regression (LR), which is a method adapted to test association between a binomial outcome and covariates, was used to build a diagnostic model for the status of the patients. Linear combination of selected biomarkers was performed using the following model:The biomarkers were selected through stepwise selection. The final regression model was selected based on optimizing the balance between its sensitivity (the percentage of predicted AD patients among observed AD patients) and specificity (here, the percentage of predicted controls among observed control patients) on both training and validation sets obtained by cross-validation.The goal of cross-validation is to limit overfitting, and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent. It is a powerful general technique to test the stability of regression model and its robustness particularly adapted in case of few data. We had used a fivefold cross-validation to partition the initial plasma sample into five parts (fold).<29> Each fold serves in turn as a validation sample of the model established on the remaining fourfold (training sample). We then had five models, allowing to calculate, in the case of a logistic regression model, the classical parameters, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, and to deduce the average and the standard deviation of each one.Final LR model could thereafter be used to assess the risk for any given patient according to its protein profile variables. Analyses were done using GraphPad Prism v6.07 (San Diego, CA, USA) and R software. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing DYRK1A were raised in Swiss mice by immunization with purified N-terminally His-tagged DYRK1AΔC (Δ502–763 C-terminal deleted DYRK1A protein). Seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced and named N1 to N7.All mAbs appeared to be good capture antibodies. N6 gave the strongest signal on western blot. M01 (Abnova) and N6 patterns were compared using samples from mouse embryos (E15; −/− mice are not viable) with 0, 1 and 2 copies of Dyrk1a. (<Figure 1a>).An immunoassay (solid phase immobilized epitope-immunoassay) was designed using the M01 and N6 antibodies with methods described previously.<27> Signals obtained from plasma samples from mice with 1, 2 or 3 copies of Dyrk1a were compared with the gene copy number showing a good correlation between DYRK1A level and gene copy number (N6: <Figure 1b>). The concentration of DYRK1A ranged between 8 and 10 ng ml−1 in mouse plasma and between 1.8 and 2.2 ng ml−1 in human plasma.As DYRK1A is a constituent of plasma, quantification of DYRK1A in such a matrix is not possible (as no ‘blank plasma’ is available and plasma from a Dyrk1a knockout animals is not available), DYRK1A plasma levels can only be compared between different populations. Using the same solid phase immobilized epitope-immunoassay method described in 'supplementary of Materials and methods' section (<Table 1>), we assessed the levels of DYRK1A in human plasma using antibody M01 (<Figure 2a>) and antibody N6 (<Figure 2b>). Both the experiments showed a similar decrease in DYRK1A in AD patients, whereas no difference was found between patients with oligosymptomatic AD and patients with dementia due to AD. Consequently, these two groups were not treated as separate, but as one group designated as AD. Mean DYRK1A level was significantly lower in AD patients compared with controls (P<0.0001) and these results were observed with both antibodies M01 and N6.The results were the same when stratified by sex, therefore results for both sexes are presented jointly. DYRK1A protein levels did not correlate with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. When stratified by APOE genotype, controls and AD patients were distributed similarly among genotypes and the average level of DYRK1A was similar in individuals with and without the APOE4 genotype (<Figure 2c>). We also analyzed the levels of sAPPbeta, which were significantly lower in cohort M AD patients (<Figure 2d>). DYRK1A levels did not correlate with sAPPbeta levels (P=0.79). The relative decrease in plasma DYRK1A observed in the Munich cohort (ELISA method) and in the Paris cohort (slot blot method) compared to controls was statistically similar. Therefore, we pooled results from the two cohorts. We detected a significant difference in DYRK1A levels between controls and AD patients (decrease of −24%, P<10−14; <Table 2>). Plasma BDNF was positively correlated with DYRK1A (P<0.05) and was lower in the plasma of AD patients; pooled results are shown in <Table 2> (decrease of −37%, P<10−9). We previously showed a negative correlation between liver DYRK1A and plasma homocysteine (Hcy), a known risk factor for AD.<30> Plasma levels of homocysteine were assessed with HPLC and were higher in individuals with AD compared with controls (increase of +28%, P<10−6). Glutathione is a major antioxidant byproduct of Hcy and glutathione levels were similar in the control group (26.8) and AD group (26.9; P=0.9, data not shown)."
PMC5537644_2,"There was no relationship between APOE genotype and BDNF or Hcy level The diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve) of the three biomarkers in differentiating patients with AD from controls (<Figure 3a>) showed significant relationships between each biomarker and the AD group. The mean areas under the curves were 0.847 for DYRK1A, 0.793 for BDNF, and 0.754 for Hcy, indicating that DYRK1A was the most accurate of the markers. PCA performed on the three biomarker descriptors enabled (i) an in-depth study of their correlation, (ii) a direct visualization of the similarity shared by the two cohorts and (iii) trend biomarker values of control versus AD groups. The first PCA plane in <Figure 3b> captures more than 83.58% of the marker variability and as such provides an efficient visualization of the data. <Figure 3c> illustrates the distribution of AD patients from both cohorts on PCA. The two cohorts can be observed (depicted in full or empty circles) as well mixed with no specific biomarker characteristics, confirming that these two cohorts can be merged to build predictive models.The visualization of patient status illustrates controls gathered in the right PCA space, corresponding to high values of PC1, while AD patients are located on the small values of PC1. This indicates that AD patients exhibit small values of DYRK1A (rel) and BDNF (ng ml−1) and rather large values of Hcy related to controls and that these biomarkers are diagnostic and potentially promising predictors of patient status.AD diagnostic models were built using statistical learning methods. Only LR models are presented (<Table 3>), as they resulted in better accuracy by five cross-validation of 0.937±0.013 than CART models (which had an accuracy of 0.881±0.024). LR was selected as an optimal combination of the predictive power of DYRK1A, BDNF and Hcy markers. Parameters for the LR have been calculated independently of age, sex and apoE genotype:On the pooled cohorts, age, sex and apoE were not significantly different between control and AD groups (P=0.54), but biomarker differences were significant (P<10−6).Adjusting for age, sex and apoE genotype were then assessed showing nonsignificant effect in LR model for age (P=0.78), for sex (P=0.53) and for ApoE genotype (P=0.54).The odds ratios for the model are presented in <Table 4>. We obtained odds ratios of 0.787 for DYRK1A, 0.20 for BDNF and 1.45 for Hcy, indicating that increased DYRK1A (relative) by one unit decreases the AD risk for a patient (risk multiplied by 0.787).DYRK1A was found to be the most predictive marker of AD and on its own has a high accuracy rate of 0.84±0.05 on five validation sets (<Table 3>). Combining DYRK1A with BDNF leads to more than a 5% accuracy increase on the validation sets, specifically the specificity (ability to predict control patients), while combining DYRK1A, BDNF and Hcy allows for more than a 3% accuracy increase.Three PCA figures (<Figure 4>) illustrate patients accurately or falsely predicted as AD using logistic regressions (LR1, LR2, LR3) obtained using one, two or three markers (DYRK1A, DYRK1A+BDNF, DYRK1A+BDNF+Hcy) showing which patients were predicted as having AD by adding BDNF or Hcy biomarkers. PCA.A illustrates the LR1 performance, which accurately predicted 77/84 AD patients and 25/36 control patients. PCA.B illustrates LR2, which predicted seven supplementary individuals (two AD and five controls) due to their high BDNF values. PCA.C illustrates LR3, which predicted four supplementary patients due to their specific values of Hcy (two AD due to high Hcy values and two control due to low Hcy values). Characteristic features of AD are memory loss, plaques resulting from abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein, presence of neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites containing hyperphosphorylated tau and signs of inflammation.DYRK1A kinase is a multifunctional enzyme known to have a role in dendrite morphogenesis<31> and in the control of excitation/inhibition balance.<3>, <32> It is also involved in tau phosphorylation (ser 212)<6> and control of inflammation through NF-kappa B and NFAT-related mechanisms.<4>, <5>, <33> DYRK1A contains a PEST sequence, which, after calpain action, removes the C-terminal part and may contribute to the decrease of native DYRK1A level.We used two antibodies to measure DYRK1A protein in plasma of AD patients and healthy controls. The M01 antibody recognized a Cter epitope (674–763 aa) and allowed for the quantification of the 95 kDa protein. The second antibody, N6, was raised against the active site (amino acids 1–562). We observed lower levels of DYRK1A in AD in two different cohorts (Munich and Paris) with two different techniques, slot blot<12> and ELISA (solid phase immobilized epitope-immunoassay), using the two different antibodies. These results validate the association of a low level of the long forms of DYRK1A (triplet around 95 kDa on western blots) in plasma from patients with AD. A reduction in this long form and an increase in truncation have been reported in brain samples from AD patients versus controls.<34> As we observed a decrease with an antibody recognizing the C terminus (long form) and with an antibody recognizing the N terminus (short and long form), our results indicate that the long form is the main form present in the plasma of both controls and patients and that plasma level of this long form correlates with its level in AD brain.Stratification according to APOE genotype confirmed previous observations<12> that DYRK1A levels are not linked to APOE genotype. In AD patients, sAPPbeta was found to be significantly lower, but there was no correlation between sAPPbeta and DYRK1A levels. This finding possibly indicates that the observed decrease in DYRK1A plasma concentration in AD may not be directly related to amyloid precursor protein catabolism and subsequently to the amyloid cascade.BDNF is essential for brain development, neuroplasticity and neuronal survival. Decreased levels of BDNF and decreased CREB phosphorylation have been linked to depression.<35> BDNF has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including affective disorders, schizophrenia, addiction, eating disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders.<36>, <37>, <38>, <39> There is solid evidence demonstrating a reduction in BDNF mRNA and protein levels in AD cortex and hippocampus.<40>, <41>, <42> Given its central role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation,<42> it is likely that a decrease in BDNF levels further contributes to cognitive dysfunction in AD. There is also evidence linking changes in BDNF to core psychopathological features of AD.<43> Recent data suggest that plasma BDNF is a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in aging women,<44> and a significant decrease in BDNF serum concentration has been found in AD patients compared with healthy controls.<45> We found a decrease in BDNF both in oligosymptomatic AD and in dementia due to AD. Interestingly, this decrease was similar in the two studied cohorts M and showing consistency in results obtained with the same technical approach.Hyperhomocysteinemia, in NPC cultures or induced by direct injection of Hcy into adult mouse brain, reduces neurogenesis<46> through a mechanism involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor–Erk1/2–cyclin E signaling pathway. In addition, it leads to a decrease in DYRK1A and increases PP2A in the hippocampus.<46> Moderately elevated plasma tHcy is a strong risk factor for vascular dementia and AD.<15> Prospectively, elevated tHcy is associated with cognitive decline, white matter damage, brain atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles and dementia. Many studies have reported this association: a landmark study<47> including 1092 elderly participants in the Framingham cohort who were free from cognitive impairment at baseline revealed a strong concentration-related effect of baseline tHcy, with no obvious threshold, with the risk of incident dementia up to 11 years later."
PMC5537644_3,"In the Prospective Population Study of Women in Gothenburg,<48> tHcy concentrations in 1368 middle-aged women were related to incident dementia up to 35 years later  In our cohorts, we found an increase of 35% in plasma Hcy in AD patients compared with controls. The Hcy level of our control group was below the 14–15 μmol l−1 critical threshold reported by previous studies<47> and the Hcy level of most of AD patients stay close to this critical value (one patient above 25 μmol l−1 in cohort P and 3 in cohort M) in agreement with the absence of severe vascular lesions in the two cohorts.As area under the curve values for these three markers were significant, we analyzed their respective efficiency and the accuracy of a composite marker. DYRK1A performed the best of the group, but the addition of BDNF and Hcy improves the efficiency of the association. For chronic diseases that may require long-term medications, accurate diagnosis is important, especially when serious adverse effects are expected from the treatment. In these cases, biomarkers are increasingly important, because they can confirm a difficult diagnosis or even make it possible in the first place. It is largely accepted that AD begins with an early, symptom-free phase. In such symptom-free patients there may be more or less probability of actually developing symptoms. In these cases, biomarkers help to identify high-risk individuals reliably and in a timely manner so that they can either be treated before onset of the disease or as soon as possible thereafter. These results, obtained with two cohorts, which have been extensively characterised, are highly significant: however, these cohorts are of limited size and it will be necessary to further confirm these results on larger cohorts.Mechanisms involved in the differences observed for these markers are still under investigation. For DYRK1A, a link with Hcy level has been previously described as involving a calpain-related pathway either in mouse liver,<49> in brains from AD patients<34> or through transcription-linked mechanisms.<50>, <51> However, polymorphism-based mechanisms can also modify DYRK1A levels through changes in the efficiency of transcriptional factors like p53 or REST.<52> We previously reported a positive correlation between DYRK1A and BDNF levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from diploid individuals<13> suggesting a genetic component to explain variability of these markers. These results associate a decreased level of DYRK1A with AD and challenge the use of DYRK1A inhibitors in peripheral tissues as treatment.In conclusion, the blood levels of these markers offer diagnosis assessment utility. To assess the value of their addition to the current panel of AD biomarkers would need the use of larger cohorts. The identification of oligosymptomatic or even preclinical AD is crucial to the initiation of preventative strategies. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to decide whether the use of these biomarkers may also allow the prediction of future cognitive decline in cognitively normal individuals. rhetorical Figure 1 Characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against DYRK1A.

The closer the descriptors are to the correlation circle, the more they contribute to explaining the variability captured by the corresponding principal components. As indicated by the projection of the biomarker variable descriptors close to the PCA correlation circle, the DYRK1A and BDNF descriptors are strongly correlated and capture the majority of the variability of the data (more than 47.60%) on PC1 while Hcy is negatively correlated with these two first descriptors and is associated with 35.9% of the variability.

Validated plasma biomarkers would circumvent these challenges. We previously identified the kinase DYRK1A in plasma. To validate DYRK1A as a biomarker for AD diagnosis, we assessed the levels of DYRK1A and the related markers brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and homocysteine in two unrelated AD patient cohorts with age-matched controls. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analyses showed that combined assessment of DYRK1A, BDNF and homocysteine has a sensitivity of 0.952, a specificity of 0.889 and an accuracy of 0.933 in testing for AD. The blood levels of these markers provide a diagnosis assessment profile. Combined assessment of these three markers outperforms most of the previous markers and could become a useful substitute to the current panel of AD biomarkers. These results associate a decreased level of DYRK1A with AD and challenge the use of DYRK1A inhibitors in peripheral tissues as treatment. These measures will be useful for diagnosis purposes. ."
